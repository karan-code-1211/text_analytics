5.0,"WOW, VERY GOOD STORY."
5.0,"Great First Novel!  Mr. Spriggs is a very talented story teller.  Although set in the late 1950's, Johnson road could be found in the rural south still today.  The well developed characters propel the story along, distracting you as the real horrific crime occurs.  The author makes you realize that no one should look through the glass window of a neighbor's house and watch what really happens behind closed doors.  In fact, you'll wonder what is really happening in your own neighborhood after this read- Eeeeek!!!!  It's rare to find a mystery with this many twists and turns that is unsolvable yet believable.  You won't be able to put it down and you won't want to either.  Johnson Road will stay with you for a while.  I can't wait to see what Mr. Spriggs comes up with next!"
4.0,"I was having trouble trying to put into words how I felt about reading this book.  I read through the reviews until I found one that described my reading experience.  The review was written by Bichon Mom.  Please read her review as she says it so much better than I do.

I was very confused reading the book. The story starts off in one time and next chapter it's an earlier time. When there was a crime what came first etc. etc.  I found I didn't want to read it but plugged on.  The ending was so abrupt I was left feeling empty and what the heck.  I do dislike books that go on and on and then just end.

And to be fair to the author books are a personal experience to the reader as much as to the author.  The reviews were mostly good and I gave it a 4 star because overall I think the author did a good job."
4.0,"A consistent theme in this book is the detectives complaint about the local hillbilly sheriffs useless reports. He notes they have a lot of information but they say nothing. That was the way I felt about reading this book. It was full of the detailed day-to-day lives of the folks on this street. It was boring at times but difficult to stop reading for some strange reason.

I was convinced that I would make my way to the end of the book and not worry anymore about the continuing saga of Johnson Street.  Unfortunately that is not the case. The book ended in such a way that I am getting ready to order part two. Very unexpected yet appreciated. If you put the effort in ....."
4.0,"Keeps you just a little off balance, while reading. Characters can be seen in the minds 're. Keeps you guessing til the end. Expect to be hearing about and  reading this author for a long time. He know mystery and drama ! Not a run of the mill mystery thriller writer, by any means !"
5.0,I really enjoyed this book. Keeps you wondering till the very end  I would recommend to any one who likes suspense
5.0,"This is a great story that had me truly hooked from the beginning. I really enjoy a Murder Mystery that can keep me guessing, and Clayton E Spriggs has certainly achieved that me for me with this wonderful book. Hes done a great job with the characters, and taking us through their lives and background. Its very interesting that so much can go on in one little street. Detective Robert Stallworths instincts are correct when he instructs the troopers to start digging. He just has that gut feeling that theres a body buried right where hes standing. Its still a shock though when they do un-earth a human skull. Purvis liked being a hermit after the war. So he was pretty happy when he found a block of land on Johnson Road all by itself, where he could build a house and hide away. Before long he found he wanted company and Sue and her son moved in with him, and marriage followed soon after. It would have been better for their relationship if Purvis explained to Sue that he was tired all the time from his nightmares from the war, and getting very little sleep. Its pretty much what the whole town think of Purvis, that hes an old man and very slow in everything he does. Johnson Road was not going to stay the quiet out of the way street, when developers started building houses. So it wasn't long before families started to move in and fill the street. As with all families though, there were things going on behind closed doors that not everyone could see. Like Sue cheating on Purvis, which half the town seemed to know about. The Jenkins dog suddenly disappearing maybe not such a coincidence when you have a couple of bored delinquent boys living in the street. Its not such a stretch from bullying other kids to harming animals. Maybe if Frank and Jacks father wasn't such a mean drunk, they might have grown up differently. Thomas and Gladys had a hard time conceiving, and when Elizabeth finally came into the world they showered her with love and affection. Hence Elizabeth had a much better temperament than Frank and Jack. With a town Sheriff that liked to do as little as possible, it was relative easy for the towns locals to get away with all sorts of indiscretions. Detective Stallworth however is a completely different man, and not one to sit back like the sheriff. Although its a mystery even for him when little Elizabeth disappears completely off the face of the earth. Johnson Road is now going to become the centre of attention like never before, and could there be a murderer living on the street? I really enjoyed the ending, and Im certainly looking forward to continuing the series with book two  Peterson County Murders. This is definitely an Author that Ill be adding to my list to watch out for."
5.0,Cliffhanger! Can't wait to read the 2nd book to get some answers to my questions about the killer. There are subtle hints throughout. Read closely!
5.0,"Wow!  This was a fantastic read, I really enjoyed it.  I didn't want it to end - I am glad there is a Part 2.  It kept me guessing... and I was totally surprised to find out who the bad guy was."
3.0,"The premise sounded interesting and this could have been a good mystery.  The writing isn't bad and the characterizations are well done.

The problem is that the chapters are disconcertingly out of sequence. Some chapters are dated and some are not.  It is difficult for a reader to determine the time frame of each, especially for the first third of the book.

Perhaps the author tried this technique as a way to create suspense but it can be very annoying trying to determine if the story is going forward or backward chapter by chapter.  There is also an extraordinary amount of redundancy in this book.

The ending was definitely rushed and left a lot of questions which the author probably plans to address in the next book in the series.  I don't plan to read it."
5.0,"Satisfyingly unsettling---Johnson Road could be anyone's neighborhood! Character introduction was a bit complicated but I felt it necessary to character development. I thoroughly enjoyed reading from each character's perspective about the events that ripped their quiet neighborhood apart. I would recommend Johnson Road to anyone, especially those interested in crime/murder mystery novels."
4.0,decent story well done
4.0,was very well written but the only thing I didn't like was that I knew who did it before I finished reading it
5.0,"as a writer i live to fmd plot hoes and found zero. i was entertained and found the style unusual. this goes far deeper than the words offered. clever reader manipuation. the stuff of movies.....well played .  i stand witj
 praise for the audacity and poise for the author. stricking prose and solid characters and flawless plotting.ago in...wel l played with a heluva payoff.brave
 yes. i recommemd this gem for sheer briliance"
4.0,"enjoyed & did not expect the end to be as it was. good story, sad @ times, but good."
5.0,hard to put down. great read.
5.0,"This book was a very enjoyable read. The beginning can be a little confusing at first, with a lot of characters to introduce and some jumping around to different times in the plot, but once you get through that, it really flows. Every chapter was easy to get lost in. The characters were intriguing. I didn't want to put the book down."
5.0,"Imagine you're sitting on the front porch in suburban Alabama, listening to the cicadas chorus rasping in the live oaks, and your host leans back in his rocker, swirls the bourbon in his glass and says in his melliferous drawl, Let me tell you a story about this place, how it began years ago.  Get ready for an engrossing tale that will send the proverbial shivers up your spine! Check out his new book, ""Billy"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-A-Tale-Of-Unrelenting-Terror/dp/B015NL3ZFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy: A Tale Of Unrelenting Terror</a>"
5.0,"Well, what can I say, except that Johnson Road kept me glued to the page from the very first line. Read this book and you'll never look at your neighbors the same way again. Along the way you will meet the residents of Johnson Road, the Bickman family, the Jenkins, and the well heeled Petersons, who lord it over the rest of the street.
Chilling and dark, this journey through a suburban nightmare will keep you up at night, as you try to figure out who the killer is. I bet you can't guess!"
5.0,"I read this book in a single rainy afternoon, I couldn't put it down. The story is set in the 1950's and early 1960's, in a small town in Alabama. The story focuses on a road within that town, Johnson Road. The book is subtly written, which underlies the sad and eventually horrific events that befall the residents who live on the road.
I think anyone who loves crime, true crime, and mystery stories would enjoy this book. The characters feel realistic, and it easy to identify with the various families the story centers around. The author does a good job of making you feel like you are peeking through the window of a neighbor's house, and discovering the hidden secrets within!"
4.0,"This was an unusual story.  A new sub-division is built on Johnson Road, an area formerly occupied only by an older man in a rundown house and now it has been turned into a neighborhood with new families moving into them.  What happens to the various members of these families and how it affects the older man  is the whole story and I think it is a good one."
5.0,"Everyone who likes murder mystery and a book which will keep you guessing until the end, then this is the novel for you. The story revolves around the building of a new housing estate on Johnson Road.  The author brings to life the residents and occupants along with their family secrets and hidden agendas.

When a young girl goes missing it brings the local sheriff and state police together and in their investigations it opens a can of worms in every household unlocking horrors and nightmares they could not envisage.

This novel had me totally engrossed from page 1, which I could read time and time again.  The descriptions of the families and what happens behind closed doors is what makes this book a must read. When you think you have figured out what has happened the author throws a spanner in the works and you have to re think your ideas.

An absolute gem of a read and I am now eagerly awaiting the authors next novel BILLY."
3.0,"Nice product Pole needs to be 6"" longer and stronger at the intersection of the two joined pieces that screw together."
4.0,Pretty sturdy and gives great shade. Also protect in light rain. Love it. The only thing that it is missing is a tie. I would purchase again.
5.0,"Bought 3 weekd. Good product for the price. How it holds over time is yet to be seen
 UV rays normally deteriorates the csnopy."
3.0,"Very light, pole should be 6"" longer and there is no cleat to wrap the cord around when open and secure"
5.0,Ours has withstood over a year of tropical Florida's sunshine and the occasional 'monsoon' rains without generating any complaints. Is there something else we could ask for in an umbrella?
2.0,Cheaply made... Canopy is so thin that sunlight and rain comes right through it. wood that supports canopy is undersized for the size of the canopy. Heavy Duty??? I don't think so.
1.0,"Ordered 2 two and one arrived damaged.  You get what you pay for, umbrella is cheap, the mast bends at the joint, material is thin, I would not buy this product again."
1.0,"This is a large umbrella and works well. The pole is about 6 inches too short so when folded down the ends hit on the table top. Not sure why and my table is a standard height patio table. It's an easy fix though by adding piece inside umbrella stand tube. The material seems thin but construction seems good. I'm happy with it so far but it's only been in use for 1 month.

Update November 2015:
After 6 months it has faded from nice green to ugly brown in the Alabama summer sun. One of the wooden stakes that extend the umbrella open has broken even though it remains closed most all the time and is always closed in stormy/wind weather. I would not recommend this product."
1.0,Buyer beware. Junk!
2.0,Save your money or buy a higher quality shade. Everything about it was cheap and sorry I wasted mine.
4.0,"The umbrella is ok., however the pole since has been cut for shipping purposes, when you put it together is very weak to resist strong wind."
4.0,"If you want a huge, sturdy patio umbrella this is the one to buy. Very nice color and materials. Pulley design is good and i have no problems pulling the wood frame when I open it. I would have given it 5 stars but the green color started fading. Otherwise its a very good buy. The wooden frame is relatively sturdy compared to its aluminum counterpart. Be prepared to buy a real heavy base for the umbrella because of its size and weight. I recommmend this umbrella."
1.0,Poor quality wood has warped
4.0,"Like others, The main pole needs to be longer"
5.0,Had these before.  Glad I found them again.
1.0,"The canopy is too big for the Tivoli 10 x 10 gazebo. Just had our first downpour with this cover installed on our Tivoli gazebo with disappointing results. I had purchased replacement covers from Target online in the past but the only color left available is a grayish blue (discontinuing?) so decided to try this one since it came in Ivory. Big mistake. This one has 4 grommets per side for more drainage - which is an improvement from the original, along with the reinforced corners - but that doesn't matter because it fits my 10 x 10 gazebo so loosely that the rain can't run off and just creates big sagging pools all around the perimeter. I went out to push the water off of the canopy and realized that water was leaking through the fabric and dripping on me. Not just where is was pooling, but all over so the canopy isn't water resistant either. Will see if I can get my money back."
3.0,Fairly easy to erect even though the instructions were not clear. Also 2 of the canopy supports were bent and it was obvious someone had tried to restore them to the original shape. The structure has held up well in the face of recent 50 mph winds.
2.0,It doesn't look good after a rain storm. my canopy has 8 F-cups after the rain. This was a waste of 80.00!
4.0,"I bought it for the Target Tivoli gazebo and it fit probably better than the original canopy, perhaps ever so slightly too big but considering that the original one was ever so slightly too small, that's actually not a bad thing at all."
5.0,"I was in need of a replacement after a few years of weather beating. I've had others before, but this one fits perfectly on my gazebo, not like the others I've gotten. The material was better than expected for the price which was half of what I've paid before. Very happy with this purchase. Thank you Access Store!"
5.0,"Shipped as promised. Quality and fit is even better than the original cover. Reinforced corners, extra Velcro attachments, grommets for rain runoff...better than expected"
1.0,fell apart in one day as soon as we put it up. its all broken.
5.0,love it.
5.0,"Love it. Great price, sturdy, arrived very quickly."
5.0,Excellent product and great value!
2.0,It looks nice but the seams are not thatchers sewn. After a few weeks one of the arms ripped open a seam and now I need to sew it back to hold the arm. I would say it's average quality and not that heavy duty
2.0,"This is not a 9' umbrella, it is 8 1/2 feet.  We ordered specifically for a 9"" opening and this does not cover it.
Average cheap construction, not sure what the 5 star ratings are all about."
5.0,We purchased the umbrealla for our daughters patio/deck.  The color was true to the picture.  the pole and structure very strong and substantial.  Everything she wanted.  Everyone was very pleased with purchase.
5.0,Very pretty.  The crank seems to work easily.  The umbrella only slips over the wood slats so it's easy for them to slip off but just as easy to slip them on.  I wouldn't say it's commercial sturdy but fine for a backyard.
5.0,Good construction and perfect for my backyard.  Thanks.
5.0,It was perfect!
4.0,Nice to display New Hampshire 3'x5'State Flag - Polyester in front of home along with the USA flag.  Reminds me of my home and last somewhat free state.
3.0,A light weight flag that will not be flown often and not in a stiff wind but is a good deal considering the low cost
3.0,"Pros:
Cheap (5 dollars total? Nice!)
Colors are reasonably accurate.
Shipping and processing was blazing fast!

Cons:
My flag was not a rectangle, but a trapezoid.
The printing isn't perfect, small things are off and colors sometimes bleed outside lines
Very flimsy material, if you want to put this flag outside, be prepared to lose it after a season, or buy a better one.

Overall:
Worth the purchase, I'd do it again.  My major pet peeve was that one of this flag's sides was cut at a slant, rather than straight.  It's very irritating to look at, so i folded it over and taped it (this flag is on my wall.)  I feel like this kind of mistake is inexcusable, regardless of how much you pay.  It's not like it costs any money to measure it correctly, and it's abnormal shape affects what little functionality it has.  Considering what I paid, I expected the other cons of this flag and I am otherwise satisfied with it.  If it had been a reasonably perfect rectangle it would have been 4-5 stars.

I recommend this for anyone who wants to use these flags for decoration somewhere free from the elements.  I have used flags with these flimsy materials outside before, and they don't last long, especially in the harsh New England weather.  Seriously, just buy the more expensive flag.  If you don't, you'll quickly find that the five dollars spent becomes five dollars flushed down the toilet."
5.0,"This flag is beautifully colored.  It is thinner than I thought it would be, but a great value for the price."
5.0,"Great for decoration! Super light, packs down really small but fills up a good portion of my wall. Shipped quickly, good quality."
4.0,"It is somewhat see through and probably won't hold up against the elements, but I got it to hang in my garage/beer hall, so it workls great for the price!"
3.0,"For the price, this is a great product. I just needed a cheap Colorado flag. However, the material is extremely thin, and will show a lot of the colors behind the material, if placed outside or on a wall. It also came folded, and those folded have been creased in a way that I cannot get them out."
5.0,"I don't spend a lot on my flags because they really get beat up.  So I but the lesser quality figuring that they'll have to be replaced a couple of times a year anyways.  The fact that this very inexpensive flag is still flying 8 months later pleases me well.  It's up about 20 feet, 7/24, and sees winds averaging 5 to 10 mph on a 'normal' day with the occasional storm friont gusts reaching as high as 60+ mph.  So far (8 months later) it's just now starting to show a little fraying on the ends.  I'll be buying another shortly to have ready when this one finally gives in."
5.0,"After vacationing in Colorado, we wanted to purchase a State Flag.  We love it and are very pleased with the quality of it."
5.0,"Super fast processing and shipping, if you are looking for flags look no more good quality product and a great company to do business with."
5.0,"The flag was new, shipped fast, and was exactly what I expected. I had a great experience with this seller!"
4.0,"I bought ten of these flags for a display.  They're perfect for my use.  They aren't a flag I'd plan to fly, but to hang up or to use a few times, they're perfect.  The store shipped quickly and they were just as described."
5.0,It's a good flag and it looks great on my wall.  Go Colorado!
5.0,lightweight nylon as advertised.  good quality
5.0,Great product.  I would recommend this product.  I would recommend this product.
3.0,I wish they did something with the edges. This flag is inside and the edges are still fraying.
4.0,The colors are great and at least mine came hemmed.  Perfect for what I wanted it for.  It is light weight but it is advertised as that so exactly what I expected.
5.0,Item as described
5.0,"good quality, no rips or tears, you might have to iron it though. so many wrinkles."
2.0,Colors bled/ weren't completely filled in the blue sections.
5.0,vERY nICE
5.0,"Quality fabric for being so cheap. I have it hanging on the wall in my room and it looks awesome. The flag of the greatest state in America, what's not to love!"
2.0,Flag is not symmetrical - one side of the flag is nearly two inches longer than the other.
5.0,Cool
3.0,"Very thin fabric, nice for indoors, not ourdo"
3.0,"Good general use flag. It will, however, fray out on the leading edge over time with the high winds we get here. Otherwise, very satisfied."
5.0,Beautiful!
5.0,GREAT PRICE I LOVE MY STATE AND COUNTRY
5.0,it looks terrific
5.0,Love it!  And a great price!
5.0,Great for what you pay for and would recommend this if you need a cheap wall flag (indoor use). The edges are not all straight but you only notice it if you look at it for a long time.
5.0,Great display flag for the den.
5.0,This was a perfect goodbye gift for our foreign exchange student as he left Colorado to go home.  Very nice.
1.0,Low quality and disproportionate.
4.0,It's a cheapie flag but it does the job.  We would probably order again.
1.0,"I do not recommend this product, even if it's intended to hang indoors as decoration. This flag is made of very flimsy material, so thin it's see-through: as if it's made of nylon tissue paper. The colors are dull, not true to what should appear on a Colorado flag. Like other purchasers, I wanted a flag to hang in a dorm room. When this flag arrived, both my son and I were very disappointed. Tip for those who want a more substantial product: check the weight and the thickness of the flag as folded for shipping."
5.0,It was perfect
5.0,"Good flag, cheap quality but holds up well. I have it in my bedroom, do not know if this would be suited for outdoor use"
1.0,This flag frayed and the grommets ripped out the first week that we had it. will not buy another one of these.
3.0,Very flimsy material and very wrinkled.
5.0,"looks great, especially for the price."
5.0,Perfect!  It was a gift for our daughter and son-in-law who just moved to Colorado from New Jersey.  They love it!
1.0,"Flag was incorrectly designed. The ""C"" was not off center as it should be."
5.0,Thanks!
4.0,For the price the quality is good.  My son wanted a flag for his room and this was perfect.
1.0,"I bought two flags, one for Chicago and one for Colorado. This is a you get what you pay for situation. Both flags looked great but the wrinkles hadn't even worn out before the edge started to fray. We're talking a couple of days and not weeks. I can't recommend these flags. While I didn't expect the best of the best, I expected it to last at least a few weeks!"
5.0,"Great for hanging on a dorm wall, colors are vibrant and detailed."
3.0,"You get what you pay for and this flag is a perfect example. While the colors are true and vivid, the thin material and weak grommets are slightly disappointing but to be expected in a five dollar flag. I bought the flag for indoor use and therefore don't need it to be durable. My biggest complaint is that the end of the flag was poorly cut. The end was clearly uneven and somewhat jagged. This problem was solved by two minutes of work with a pair of scissors, but it was still irritating that the product had that much room for improvement when it was received by the customer. Bottom line: good flag for indoor use but it is not duarable and the end will likely have to be smoothed out with scissors prior to use."
3.0,"The flag was cut/sewn uneven. I hung the flag on my wall and it is visibly crooked. Really disappointing. They also shipped through Ontrac, which is possibly the worst delivery company in existence. Order through someone else."
1.0,"This flag was trash, the C was in the center and the colors were wayyy off, do not buy, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY"
5.0,Great! Exactly what I ordered!
5.0,"Perfect flag, no rips or stains. Perfect for the dorm room."
1.0,Was not rectangular
3.0,Nothing wrong with the flag and it is holding up ok but I have had other flags for the same price that were much sturdier than this one.
4.0,"Hung it up on my closet door. Not the highest quality (feels a little stiff/plastic-y), but perfect for my needs!"
3.0,"CHEAP quality for a cheap price. Not surprised, happy?"
1.0,Rips so easily!
3.0,hard to get the initial creases out but it's hard to beat that price....
5.0,solid material.
4.0,"This flag looks good, and fits well as a wall decoration for me. It comes slightly bigger than the stated 3x5ft, but it's only a slight adjustment for hanging it from a wall. It doesn't look to suitable for a flagpole, as it seems slightly translucent, but mounted on a wall as it is, it is no doubt an excellent accent to a otherwise empty white wall."
5.0,Looks great on my wall!
3.0,"These are bright, large flags, but definitely not durable enough for outdoor use (I display mine indoors, so not a big deal considering the low price). However, I bought two and both are irregularly shaped - they have more of a tilted parallelogram cut rather than a perfectly straight rectangle shape, which means they hang funny from their two grommets. They are not stitched on any of the edges, so I can't really fix the shape by re-sewing it. Not bad if your intended use is more decorative rather than practical or durable."
5.0,Colorado!!!!!
5.0,"This is an inexpensive flag. It is accurate, and nice enough for the price."
4.0,Not much to say about the flag.  It is a cheap (price wise) polyester flag that serves its purpose in our school cafeteria.  The color is vibrant and the size is a true 3' x 5'.
4.0,"I love the flag, but there is 1 issue: The right side is uneven, and it does not form right angles with the top and bottom sides. Even still, it looks great!"
3.0,"A little thin, you can see through this even against the wall. Mine was assembled sloppily, so the lines are not square with the edges. Worth the less than $5 I paid."
5.0,"I had frayed edges in 2 days, but it still flies"
4.0,Great flag only disappointment is that the outside edges of the flag are not hemmed flag does have great color though
4.0,"Nice flag to hang on the wall. For the price, I think it is a good buy"
5.0,"Nothing says ""Best State in the Country"" like a big old Colorado flag.  I am a recent transplant to the heathen lands of the Bay Area, and this piece of home reminds me of a place where men are men, women are women, and we all hate Texans and Californians.  Definitely a must have!"
3.0,The flag it self is beautiful but they did not finish the end and it is raveling already so unless I sew it quickly the flag will be destroyed.
4.0,washed in bag in washing machine and ripped a little. hand wash.
4.0,Great quality for an unbeatable price. Looks like it costs at least $20.
4.0,Very big and thick material. Good price too.
5.0,"Perfect! in price, delivery time and product. Thanks"
1.0,"No hems whatsoever. I would've paid more for better quality. Also, it's a bundle of wrinkles."
4.0,a
5.0,"C-O, you know! Perfect for setting off the Colorado pride. Not only is weed legal but we also live in a damn postcard. Just can't beat the state or the price on this one. Looks great on the wall & gets lots compliments for less than $10"
5.0,Good quality flag
4.0,"You get what you pay for... a great decoration piece in a garage / house, but not for flying."
2.0,"I was disappointed in the Colorado State Flag.  Even though the colors are vibrant as advertised, the material is flimsy and there is no hem along the sides or end.  I gave this flag 2 stars only because one star rates it as hating it...I do not hate Colorado's beautiful flag.  I feel badly that I did not spend more money for a flag of better quality.  With the high winds experienced in my location, I do not expect the flag to last very long.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item."
5.0,On my daughters wall while she attends college. Reminds her of home.
5.0,"I reordered this flag after the first one lasted 2+ years in the Colorado sun and wind. For the price, it can't be beat. Good service and delivery too."
2.0,Started ripping in the wind the first week with just the usual amount of wind.  I bought two but they won't last long
5.0,"Serves the purpose and seems to be holding up well.  I'm a little concerned about fading of the colors, but we'll see how that goes.  For the price, I think it is a good buy."
5.0,"I have love for Colorado like no other place I know.
Nice flag to hang on the wall and show my pride."
4.0,"This flag is a decent flag for the price, but you definitely get what you pay for with this item. I was a little surprised at how thin it is, but it is perfect for my uses: hanging indoors!  The only reason I rate this item at 4 stars rather than 5 is that there is an area that the color is bled (roughly the size of a US $.50 piece), but it isn't big enough to be a deal breaker for me.

Pros: Affordable flag, large size, great for indoor use
Cons: Thin, possible quality issues?

I'd still recommend it though!"
5.0,"It is a little see-through, but on a white wall is perfect. It's a really good size and it's durable."
5.0,"Good quality. The flag is REALLY big, but it hangs just perfectly outside of my dorm window. I would definitely recommend this flag for being put outside. The flag is really sheer, as a side note."
5.0,This flag is HUGE I love it and think for the price it is indeed worth the money. Very good fabric
3.0,Very thin fabric and you can see through the flag but its nice large not something I can put outside .
5.0,"If you want to represent to others that you know what's up, you WILL purchase this Colorado State Flag!  Not only have we legalized here, but the flag is not against the law to posess either!  Move to Colorado, light one up and let that freak flag fly!"
5.0,"I decided to use this flag as a decoration in my room and also as a going away present. Overall, the flag is not super heavy but the nylon is easy to iron to eliminate the fold marks and it is a great addition to the very bare wall. No complaints what-so-ever."
5.0,"I got this so much faster than expected.  You really cannot beat the price.  The flag does not look cheap, especially not for 86 cents!  It is somewhat see through, like other reviews explained, but it is not so transparent that I would not recommend this flag to others.  I absolutely love it and am proud to support that 303 love! :)"
4.0,"I wanted a flag to display at our roadside encampment during the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.  This was a better deal than I would have dreamed of.  The flag is made of a lightweight polyester fabric with bright printed colors - perfect for our purposes.  I'm sure that it would not hold up to everyday exposure in our Colorado weather, but for occasional use it fits the bill.  And for less than $6 delivered, it was just perfect."
5.0,I bought this flag to hang in my dorm room and it is exactly what i wanted and you cannot beat the price! it is a little sheer but it looks good tacked to a wall. If you are looking for an outdoor flag this is not the flag for you!
5.0,for being so cheap this flag is awesome. I have it hanging on my wall and it's perfect. I wouldn't use it outside or against a really dark wall since it's pretty thin and see through. but it's perfect against a white/light colored wall and its sooo cheap!
5.0,"Good quality, low price, a very good buy. I am using this just below the U.S. flag on a 10 foot flag pole and it looks awesome."
5.0,"I love Colorado, and what better to show it than owning a Colorado flag? This flag is great! The size is amazing. Makes you a true Coloradoan."
1.0,You get what you paid for. The flag material is eh. Best of all it was cut crooked! The bottom portion is about 4 inches shorter than the top of the flag therefore it look ridiculous when hung on the wall.
5.0,"I bought this to hang in my room, and it does just that. But, it is way too thin to hang outside, so do not purchase it for that."
2.0,The flag feels durable but its been printed crooked which would be fine if I were hanging it outside but I bought it for my dorm room and it drives me crazy looking at it straight on. The one I got for my boyfriend is the same.
5.0,"Easy, Fast, and Reliable.  Received my flag in a very short amount of time and it was the exact one I ordered."
2.0,Cheap flag. Cheap thin material. Was in tiny bag for too long and the color seeped through onto the white part so now I have red and blue instead of white. Do not recommend.
5.0,"The size of the flag was exactly as ordered.  It was a lighter weight than I would have liked but that was my fault for not knowing what exact specs I wanted.  But this is only for my grandson's Cub Scout Troop and is used 95% of the time indoors so the flag  will work just fine.

For the price it was fantastic.  I will order from this vendor again."
5.0,"I bought this flag to take on a trip where there will be people from all over attending. It is exactly what I needed.  I don't expect that it will be super durable, but it is great for short term ...and who knows? It may hold up a lot better than I expect."
5.0,"I'm using it for wall decor and its perfect. Very very thin though and if I planned to
Fly it outside I'd buy a better one."
3.0,"The picture looks a little nicer than the actual flag.  The flag in person has less vivid colors and is really light-weight, flimsy and see-through material."
5.0,This flag is made of really nice materials. It does not have all the wrinkles that other cheap flags have on amazon that are made of polyester. Colors are vibrant not fade at all.
5.0,"The flag arrived safely and in excellent condition.  The colors are bright and the flag is brand new.  This is just the thing I was looking for and the price was right.  I'm very happy with this purchase, although not knowing where it was and when during the shipping process was a little disheartening.  Overall, I'm very happy with the product and the condition of the flag when I opening the packaging. I look forward to enjoying this beautiful flag in the years to come."
3.0,It shipped promptly. But upon reception I noticed it was a tad damaged in one of the corners. Overall I was satisfied but was by no means impressed.
5.0,"Great flag, although the creases from the folds still linger around, but nothing some steam can take care of. Would recommend"
5.0,Good deal shows off my colorado pride. I love colorado so wanted a flag to show off my pride. This flag was perfect because i wasn't looking to spend too much money!
5.0,"It's exactly what the description says.  Colorado state flag....and it's as cheap as dirt.  If you're looking for an inexpensive Colorado flag for your teen going to college or for yourself, this is a good choice."
5.0,"Each member of my family was born in a different state so I bought one for each of us. The kids love them, it gives them a pride in their homestate. These are cheaply made flags, but they are just for hanging in our boys bedrooms."
4.0,"The flag arrived super fast and looks pretty nice. I have it on the wall already, the stitching on one end is crooked actually which is weird so it doesnt line up with the other flags I have on the wall. Very thin material so it will rip easily if you don't put the thumb tac in the right spot and mine tore a small bit. But the colors are clean and look great!"
5.0,"Never has there been such a beautifully crafted flag. The great state of Colorado has so much going fo it, and I'm proud to wave this flag in support."
2.0,If you're looking for a high quality flag this is not the flag you wanna buy.  But if you're looking for a cheap flag that'll serve a basic need (decorative mainly) then this might be the flag for you.  The only things that I didn't like about it were the material (it was too thin) and the color (it was too light; I wish it was a little darker).  Otherwise it was decent.
5.0,"The flag shipped on time and even arrived 2 days early. The flag itself is the right sized and is what's pictured (Colorado state flag). I hung this flag on my wall and it looks great. I would not purchase this flag to hang outside and expect it to withstand the elements for long. Yes it's creased from being folded but I expect those will come out over time. Also I read that some people had problems with it being too thin, but the white wall doesn't show though it. I would think that on a dark (black) background it may be noticeable. However this is an awesome price for a good looking flag to hang inside."
4.0,"I bought this flag to hang in my garage. Being from Colorado and in the military, I wanted something to hang up to show pride in where I'm from. This flag is somewhat transparent but works great for hanging on a wall. I don't think I'll ever fly it outside."
3.0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Colorado-US-State-Flag-3x5foot-poly/dp/9539723809/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Colorado US State Flag: 3x5foot poly</a>Not something that worth buying, a much better materiel this one will torn down in the first wined I can't use it for the out side"
5.0,Represent! I am in love with my state and I absolutely had to get a flag for my wall. This flag is so much better than I expected it to be! The price was so low and the flag is beautiful. Its large and well made. I love it. Can't imagine my apartment without it <3
5.0,"I'm a big fusion fan and have always liked Carlton. I have some random songs downloaded, but never picked up one of his CD's until now. This is a great CD for someone to start with. Carlton is one of the best and the music is good, end-to-end."
5.0,Larry Carlton is possibly the best american guitarist at this time.  This cd is an excellent collection of his music.  I have no complaintes  This is an excellent cd.
5.0,"I originally bought Larry Carlton's ""Collection"" CD because it contained the song ""Sleepwalk"" which my wife and I played at our wedding reception. It wasn't long before I grew to love almost every track on the CD! Over the years I have listened to it hundreds of times, and even used several tracks as test pieces when purchasing new speakers for my audio room. Recently the CD went missing (or perhaps one of my friends permanently borrowed it!). Despite having all the tracks in MP3 format on my PC, I've ordered another copy on CD - It's that good. If you like this CD you might also like one of the CDs by Foreplay. Happy listening."
5.0,Sweet Guitar from Larry Carlton. The Collection is his Greatest Hits and there isn't a bad track on the CD. This music is great cruising music. Open the Sun Roof and just Drive to Nowhere. Enjoy the smooth jazz sound of Larry Carlton.
4.0,"Larry Carlton is one of the few great guitarists whose style is so distinctive that you recognise it the moment you hear it.  His smooth, expressive tone is what many guitarists can only dream of coming close to.

He is also probably one of the most requested session musicians ever.  His early work with Steely Dan was just brilliant and here on this disc, although you don't get the Steely Dan stuff, you get a very good representation of his first 12 years in the business.

As is expected of a GRP recording, the sound quality is excellent coming from a digital master and there are two never before released recordings as well.  The best track is ""Sleepwalk"" which shows you just what great phrasing the guy has, probably one of the hardest things for any musician to achieve is good phrasing and LC achieves this with ease.

A brilliant musician and a great disc!"
5.0,Larry has had a very successful career. This CD captures a number of the better tunes from his earlier years.
5.0,This disc has some great solid Performances on it. Carlton's take on The Doobie Brothers Minute by Minute is a Pure Gem. I really dig his Guitar work.
5.0,excellent!!!
5.0,satisfied
4.0,"MR. CARLTON HASN'T LOST A STEP SINCE LEAVING THE "" JAZZ CRUSADERS """
5.0,Great CD.
5.0,"For all of us swept up in the cool breeze of smooth jazz, this is a must for your collection.  Diverse tunes; so many feel-good moments!"
5.0,Very pleased with the product and the transaction. The CD is ine I was looking for since many years ago.
4.0,I got this because it has a few of the hits that I really like on it.  I found some others on here that I really like and did not know that he did.  This CD is recommend to all that like Larry.
5.0,It don't get any better than Larry carlton with his style. He is great an icon in his ownstyle. You will like this CD
5.0,"How did I miss this CD, I guess you can't buy them all.  Hey its on my computer and its been playing non-stop in my truck player. I loved his stuff with Steely Dan and Fourplay, and his solo stuff continues to smoke.  This compilation is great for those who want a sample of his playing and can't buy it all.  Need to follow his releases more carefully.  BUY THIS CD."
5.0,Larry never disappoints in any of the music he does.  This CD contains a collection of some of his best.  I don't know how you're able to pick out these when everything he does is classic.  If you love Larry you'll love this.
5.0,Magnificent detail. Far superior to the hot wheels 1:18 ferrari we also ordered from a different supplier. Really incredible.
5.0,"Ordered a few Yat Mings as well as the Shelby collect. This Tucker is right up there with the Shelby Collect brand.

Amazing detail, right down to the logo on the rear hood.

Super Paint Job! Clear Coat appearance

Didn't remember that the Tucker was rear engine.

This car was so far ahead of anything made in the late 40's.

No brainer on this one if you like the era."
5.0,"paint job is fantastic, interior and engine are perfect, trunk even has luggage. suiside doors are my favorite part, true collectors item!"
5.0,"We got these along with the Country Market Set for our daughter's 3rd birthday and she immediately fell in love!  She isn't a dollhouse, Barbie type of girl, but she loves her animals and these are PERFECT!!!  They are SO detailed and just darling!!!  A must have for any of the Calico Critters Houses!!"
5.0,"My daughter has played with the 80's version of the Calico Critters at Grandma's from age 3 on up, and was delighted when she received this mouse family for her birthday.  She loves imaginative play and has made a beautiful homemade shoebox house for her little mice, including furniture made from household odds and ends.  She is getting her brother another Critter family for his 5th birthday so their families can be neighbors.
These are wonderful toys, very cute and well-made.  Their arms and legs move, and their little outfits are adorable.  The only difficulty we've had so far is in tying the tiny outfit ties when they come undone (such as the baby twins' miniscule outfits that are tied with tiny bows).  They are quite durable, just as the 80's versions were (and are).  I highly recommend them for any child who has a good imagination and who loves pretend play with families."
5.0,WE BOUGHT THIS MOUSE FAMILY AS A GIFT FOR OUR FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ALONG WITH THE HOUSE AND ACCESSORIES. SHE ENJOYS PLAYING WITH IT EVERYDAY.IT IS MADE WELL AND IS ADORABLE.
5.0,THE QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD!
4.0,purchased for our cats to use..its secured to their scratching pole and the like it.
5.0,very nice for the price
5.0,this is a must have to the chugger collection.
5.0,"purchased as a gift to a frequent traveler, they loved it."
4.0,very good
5.0,"Great gift for any student, or social study teacher."
5.0,Bought as a gift. It is being enjoyed!!
5.0,"I've seen map like this at my aunt's and like it so much that decided to get it. I've chosen this one because liked the way it looks, very stylish and matches my room."
4.0,A bit cheap looking but will look good in a frame. Careful when rolling it up to not scratch the countries off on accident.
5.0,"Amazing Breaker Bar , Loved thank you Amazon."
4.0,"I am only rating this four stars because my selfie stick arrived a bit dirty.. The product had some fingerprints on it, indicating that it was used prior to when I opened it. I found this a bit off-putting. The product itself has a nice sleek design, and is definitely one of the classier selfie sticks I've seen. I have yet to try it out, but I tested the holder with my phone and it holds the phone in place very well. I will be sure to update my review once I have the opportunity to try this out."
5.0,This is my second brush since I liked the first one so much. It's great breads and for thinning hair too as it kinda pushes more hair uniformly vs a brush with more spaced out bristles. Feels softer on scalp too.
5.0,"My girlfriend and I don't travel a lot, but we are planning to. And this scratch map is the best bet ever. We put it in the living room.  It adds traveling mood to the room immediately. We have already marked Netherlands as the next place we go in February. It looks pretty cool out there."
5.0,This arrived so fast! It will be wonderful gift for my world traveler daughter.
5.0,"The greatest advantage of this map is the function of scratch off. It makes the map original and attractive. I like the way it looks on the wall in our hall, very stylish and modern. Nice!"
5.0,"I believe this is a great price for such a wonderful product. I've no complaints about it, the map is well done, high quality material and the idea of scratching is worth five stars. Delighted!"
5.0,"I don't know anything more exciting than looking at the map. I love political, geographical, key maps. I would investigate this for hours. This scratch off map is one of the best in my collection."
5.0,"My view is that this kind of maps is perfect for present for birthday, wedding or anniversary. Probably, there is no a person who wouldn't love this map. Well made and nicely designed!"
5.0,"This cheap little headset I've had for 10 years.  It still works.  Nothing is wrong with it other than I'm missing the foam on the mic part... but I lost that.  So...yeah, for something that I was supposed to throw away within 6 months, it's still going strong.  I got it to play X-Box 360 games... I'm using it for PS4 now."
5.0,"This map is worth its price. I used to pay attention to details. Well, this product is really quality, each country is well shaped and their sizes are correct. Besides, it's pretty easy to scratch the map and the background is bright and we'll colored."
5.0,This map is in his room and due to age he can't use it how it's supposed to. But he saw an opportunity. He marks every country he has read about and it works pretty well.
5.0,"Very good brush, soft bristles and easy to use"
5.0,I love that the back has a flap to make it look like hes selling ice cream. My boys love chugging on trains. So much cheaper than Thomas. And the show is more fun.
5.0,One of the best purchases so far! Love it! 10x :)
5.0,"I love this scent!  I can't find it in the stores anymore, so I buy through here.  I put it on every day all over when I get out of the shower.  I've worn it for years and it just makes me smell clean and feel fresh.  It's not so strong that you can't wear your normal perfume after you're dressed, but it's strong enough that when somebody is close to your skin, they can still smell it."
5.0,Grandson loves it!
4.0,"We go these for the ""Baby go Bye Bye"" crawling Baby Alive! doll. Overall they are too big, but snug enough to stay on for a few minutes at a time. I have not tried washing them to see if they will shrink. They are a little smaller than typical baby socks though... I'd say abou 3/4ths the size of the smallest newborn socks I've seen. I think these would be a good size for a preemie baby or a larger baby doll. The ""baby go bye bye"" doll is 15 inches.

If the maker reads this and wants a suggestion... you should see these in sizes, I really like the design."
5.0,Great model not disappointed also a good price.
5.0,"I should purchase another one to replace this one when it dies.  It's great, no complaints.  I might even be experiencing less hair loss due to its super soft, yet functional bristles.  I use it on my head, not beard."
5.0,"My boys love plush toys, These have lasted several wash and dry cycles. Worth the money."
5.0,"Thank you, Raed Milyani."
5.0,These are perfect for my granddaughter's baby doll.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,Bought it for a niece and now I am her favorite aunt.
4.0,"Kids love it, but not as buoyant as I thought it would be."
5.0,Super cute!! Daughter loved them
5.0,Awesome backpack ! Never Been so happy with a purchase! Highly recommend this bag! You can use for hiking and other !
5.0,Beautiful backpack. I love it. Looks just as pictured.
5.0,"It's amazing. I love the shoulder straps, the outside pockets... Pretty much everything. The inside of the bag is a lot bigger than I thought. I use this to go to college and work, so it definitely fits everything in there. It has a laptop section too. Too bad it doesn't have more pockets inside for pens and such, but the outside pockets make up for it. Best part is that I got lots of compliments from my coworkers."
5.0,I love this bag!! There it a lot of room and pretty lightweight for its size. This is by far my most favorite backpack I've ever had. Also it is really comfortable around the shoulders.
5.0,"I absolutely love this bag! Comfortable to wear, and love the storage. The fact it opens from the top and is deep is a huge perk. Wonderful storage with plenty of packing space! Super nice fabric, looks trendy and is of high quality. I've traveled with it multiple times and would buy again. Wish I had one in every color."
5.0,This was a great purchase! The bag held up well and made me feel like this was definitely a great buy. I use this daily for carrying books and a laptop and I have never had an issues with storage space
5.0,Great plush
5.0,"Exactly as described, arrived on time, very pleased!"
5.0,none
5.0,MY DAD LOVED this car!!!
5.0,"Nice and soft...great if you don't have a thick beard, and don't want something abrasive on your face. Heavier beard? You may want to consider a brush with harder bristles."
4.0,Soft bristles don't hurt head
5.0,Last until you take it off
5.0,Good doll and a great value. You may have to sew the button on his jacket - I have 2 times now.
5.0,great
5.0,works good
5.0,Works Great for crazy beard hair.
5.0,Seems to be well made and has a very nice chrome finish.
5.0,I love this product & can't find it in any local stores. It's my go to body spray!
5.0,"Great for those of us who are visually limited and heave to
write in big, bold letters without bleeding through the page!"
5.0,Firm and small enough to carry.  Does the job
5.0,These are so cute & perfect for the Bitty Baby.
5.0,"Work and fit just like the original, except these are washable."
5.0,"This brush has the perfect ratio of soft to firm bristles. I'm trying to outgrow the end of my peach fuzz stage and I have the occasional hairs that stick straight out, it feels nice to comb with and I'm pleased with it. The size is just bigger than my palm."
5.0,Very nice brush holds hairs which i really like and feels good using
5.0,Nice size! Good quality
5.0,Thank you they are great pens easy to see.
5.0,Love it!  Does the job
5.0,"LOVE THIS STUFF, always need some on hand"
5.0,Great beard brush!
5.0,"Practical -useful pens-great for large print writing.
Use for variety of writing tasks.
I want to order more but appears they are no longer offered.
Any suggestions where to purchase more of these?"
5.0,"This is the perfect color for my eyes.  Surprisingly, the shimmer hides the wrinkles on my old eyelids.  Love this product."
5.0,So cute! Granddaughters AG dolly will love them!
5.0,This brush keeps my wily beard in check. I used to have my hair going all over the place but now it knows what to do. It really helps with the extra thick parts; I used to use a comb and it would pull on my hair. This is much better.
5.0,I use this daily to tame my beastly beard and it works wonders!
5.0,"I used to purchase thesse pens at an independent living store, but they don't carry them anymore.  they offer something similar, but not as good nor do they last ass long as these.  These 20/20 pens are what I use  exclusively for my bold writing, since I am legally blind and need a bolder print, but not too thick of a tip.  I love these and will continue to purchase them here.  They are PERFECT for visually impaired persons and work great with  bold line paper."
5.0,Perfect size. Works great!
5.0,Looks just like the picture  plus it came 7 days urly!
5.0,This giraffe is super soft!!! Bought it for my nephew and he loves it!
4.0,"Does what it says, although the bristles weren't as soft as I was expecting. Still, a good deal and I like the wood finish."
4.0,"I bought these pens for my sister who has very low vision and this is the only pen she likes,"
5.0,"This pen is outstanding for addressing packages or making labels for files - or just writing easy-to-see notes . The ink doesn't smear or seep through the paper at all - a major plus. The point is strong and a nice size - large enough to be seen on packages, small enough to be practical for notes and lists. The pen lasts a long time. Great for visually impaired individuals too."
5.0,Purchased for son in law with vision disability. Second time I've purchased as they have been a great help to him.
5.0,Item arrived on time.  Good product
5.0,"Very satisfied with the product, bristles aren't too hard or too soft. Very nice for brushing the hair on your head too!"
5.0,"Jellycats are the softest stuffed animals around, absolutely love them!"
5.0,Adorable
5.0,"They work well and do not bleed to the back side of the paper.  Wish red ones were available.  Good, quick service from Amazon."
5.0,Beautifull!!!!!
5.0,I liove this writing instruent
5.0,Just what grand daughter wanted for her doll
5.0,"This thing is a beast!  I just finished using it to rig a cave down over 1300+ feet of vertical drop.  It is super light and each batter charge punches so many bolt holes, it is ridiculous.  That means we could carry fewer batteries, which is lighter, which means I love this device!!!"
5.0,"Fantastic drill. Used it on a caving expedition in Mexico and the power and sustainability it has, on top of being extremely light weight is amazing."
5.0,Arrived just as expected.
5.0,"These are for my mother who has limited vision. She reports that the pens work well, are easy for her to read, and do not run."
5.0,It is a great help to my wife who has poor eyesight .
5.0,These aRe only pens I use.  This is what my eye disability gave me and I finally used the last ones and had to find a place that carried them!
5.0,sweet
5.0,"This seller's descriptions have always been spot on, no pun intended. This little giraffe's colors are vibrant, cream and light brown. The tip of his tail and his mane are a vibrant deeper brown."
5.0,Great for low vision
4.0,"These pens are great for me to write with. They have just the perfect point, bold enough that I can see it, but not so bold that you can only write a few words on a piece of paper. The best part is that they do not bleed through to the other side of the paper. The downside is they dry out way too fast. I try recapping them immediately, but they just do not last long."
5.0,Fast shipping and my grandson loves it
5.0,Very satsfied.  It  is an outstanding product.  Salvation for me.
5.0,"Package arrived promptly. The socks fit Bitty Baby like knee highs, won't slip off."
5.0,It was perfect!
5.0,It's a great pen for eye impaired people.
5.0,I was very happy to find them on your site.  I have a friend that has to use these pens or she could not write.  She was so excited when I took them to her.  She told me that no one else could find them for her.
5.0,Let me start off by saying this is the cutest little baby float I have ever seen! she just adores it! The float is super cute colors and very attractive to little kids. My daughter loved the added steering wheel and horn. She had a blast honking the horn every time somebody swam by.
5.0,"A very dear friend of mine is slowly losing her sight.  These pens make it possible for her to continue to take notes and communicate with others because the felt tip is much thicker than most, does not smear, dries fast, and is easy to read.  Thanks for delivering a great product in a timely manner."
5.0,Cute!
5.0,my son loves emojis and was so excited to get these. all of them are on his backpack.
5.0,My granddaughter was thrilled!  Excellent product and service!
5.0,Great size. My son likes to play with them with his friend. It's the same size as all of the plants they have and they both really liked it. It seems sturdy enough for them and I'll definitely be buying more.
5.0,good buy

5.0,Very cute Emojis!!!
5.0,exactly as advertised.
5.0,Bought this for a birthday party and it was perfect!
5.0,Just too good! Didnt expect these to be so nice. I actually got extra keys made just to use these cute keychains! Highly recommended.
5.0,This is a beautiful family!
5.0,"Just got this in mail today. My 5y.o. son is so very happy and excited he absolutely loves it.

We had a problem with first zombie arriving and seller responded immediatley to mail and corrected problem. Excellent seller amd excellent response times hughly recommended."
4.0,"This was very nice and looks good in the bathroom with the

5.0,adorable

5.0,So cute and soft.  My son loves it!
5.0,"Great buy
Excellent quality"
5.0,"This mouse set is so much cuter in-person.  The mouse family is definitely on top of my list as one of my favorites. Their faces are so adorable, you just can't help but feel all giddy.  Their hands are a little different than my other Calico Critters/Sylvanian Families in a sense that they can hold things--like a small cup for example. My other CC/SF family sets cannot do that.  Also, they feel a little fuzzier and the weight seems a little lighter.  Underneath each foot, there's a sticker that says 1985 Epoch.  I wonder if this is the original line from the 1980s.
I'm so glad I bought this to add to my collection.  The seller is from Germany and they did a nice job packaging the item.  It arrived on-time and would like to purchase more from them."

5.0,I love these Vamplets! They are all so adorable. I can't wait to give it to my step daughter for her birthday. She is a Monster High fan so I think she will love it.  I wouldn't mind having one (or several) myself.
4.0,"Only issue was that one of the bottles leaked and I lost about 1/3 of a bottle (the pkg it came in smelled really nice, though).  Lid wasn't screwed on tight.  Other than that, I'm very pleased."
5.0,So soft
5.0,Have ordered from Sophia's when purchasing clothing ad accessories for American Girl Bitty Baby. The quality is good and their pricing even better.

5.0,"These key chains are great and a wonderful value. Share them with your friends (or keep them all for yourself)!  My daughter was so excited to receive them for her birthday and promptly put them on all the zipper pulls of her backpack. She lives them. They are a bit smaller than the ones sold in the mall, but still absolutely adorable."
5.0,Got this breaker bar in 2 days. Works great and goes with the other 100 I already have. I have too many tools. Lol

5.0,The giraffe was so soft. It was a gift.
5.0,I was so happy to find this body spray. I thought that the body spray and deodorant scent has been discontinued by Secret. I cannot find this scent anywhere. Thank you for having this.
5.0,Franklin was made well and arrived quickly!  He was the perfect gift!  Never mind the fact it was for a 24 year old.  I bought this for her inner child and she will give it to hers someday:)
5.0,Very adorable addition to my memorial garden for my beloved Furbabies
5.0,"All critter families are adorable, well made, and dressed in clothing with great attention to detail, if not on trend with current fashion.  ;)

That said, we have developed a real affinity for the rodent families, having collected the chipmunks, the hamsters, and now these mice.  I think what draws us to these types of families is that they seem actually to scale to their real counterparts, but with soft and sweet anthropomorphic features.  So sweet!  Some of the families labeled Sylvanian or Flair are not readily available in the USA under the Calico Critters brand....

I bought these from a seller in Europe and they arrived quickly and safely.  Since I was not here to sign for them, I had to pick them up at the post office, and I really appreciated that I had to sign for them.

Great product and transaction.  Amazon.com, you never disappoint!"
5.0,This needs to be in the store. WetnWild pigmentation is unbelievable to be so cheap
5.0,It was a cute dress and I am sure my niece will love putting this dress on her doll on Easter Sunday.
5.0,Was not available locally but was greatly enjoyed by my 4 year old granddaughter.
5.0,What Has Sandy Clawzs left beneath our tree? Why it is a horrific plush toy that will surely haunt my children's slumber. These plush toys are for child and adult alike. they are viciously soft and creepily adorable. They will crush your will to deny them their mesmeric enchantment.
4.0,"It is beautiful but smaller than I thought. (I know, dimensions are listed). For some reason I still thought it would be bigger."
5.0,It works good.
5.0,"My granddaughter dressed her American Girl doll in this outfit for a special Valentines Day lunch at the American Girl Cafe in Los Angeles, CA.

5.0,"Cutest little monsters ever!  My daughter loves all these little guys,,,"
5.0,This dress is absolutely adorable it fits the standard American Girl Doll perfectly and is very durable. I highly recommend this product to others.
4.0,"This is a great product with adquate amount of detail given the price point.  It would have been even better if for example some of the Tucker innovations such as seat belts would have been shown in some manner;also a ""suspension"" for model  would also have been a nice addition.
Overall, however, I recommend the Product.  Plus Seller was very prompt and item was delivered promptly with detailed Tracking information.  And above all, Product was as promised and not damaged in any way."
5.0,Use a old atx power supply if you have this charger. It will cut the charging time in half. It can only charge at 2amp on a.c. and 4 amp on dc. Also if you set the charger on the power supply it keeps it cool.
5.0,"The Vamplets won Christmas.  Well made, wonderful stuffed toys. My Nieces are now each a proud Vamplet parent, they couldn't have been happier."

Granddaughter  has loved the things we got her from Emily Rose.  They can't be beat!"

5.0,"So pretty!  I love that she's holding a cat, my cat in heaven!!!"
5.0,"Beautiful, expertly detailed and amazing dress and purse. Added to a 18"" doll that was given to the local Fire Department Toy Drive. Its going to make a little girl very happy this Christmas.

5.0,Cute socks at a great price
5.0,The is a Christmas give. We will see what she thinks.
5.0,"Howliss was our first Vamplet and my daughter loved him for the start. We purchased him at DragonCon. He has held up well to 2+ years of very rough love. We loved him so much that we have backed the bitemares and the release of plushes that included Howliss's sister, Feraline. We have recommended Vamplets to all of our friends and family!"
5.0,"They are so adorable, we have had one for a couple years and they hold up great."
5.0,"I have purchased many a vamplet in my life.  These devious little monsters will worm their way into your heart.  Howliss is a personal favorite of mine.  He is fairly well house trained and has only eaten one government worker that was unfortunate enough to disturb the baby werewolf's nap.

Beautifully crafted, Howliss and the other vamplets make great additions to any family.  I hope to be unfortunate enough to own them all."
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,"Bought Baby Howliss, and LOVE him! He's everything you'd hope for in a wee baby werewolf. :) Soft, fluffy, and really well crafted.  The image is completely representative, and you get exactly the plush toy you're expecting.  Can't wait to add to my collection, and give Howliss some company in his nursury. :)"
5.0,Nice quality !
5.0,Cute outfit bought for my daughter to give to her friend for Christmas. This pink party dress comes with the matching purse and fits her 18 in MyLife doll perfectly.
5.0,My daughter LOVES these dolls! She has 5 now and always asking for a new one. The seller ships quickly and we've never had any issues.
4.0,"Hate to rate a bosch under 5 stars, just doesn't have the power for holes over 1/2"" diameter thought metal. Bare concrete you can go as high as 3/4"" diameter."
5.0,Just the cutest thing!!! Absolutely love him!! I ordered his sister too and will both proudly stay in my daughters room!! She loves them!!
5.0,"This is absolutely exquisite! It's made of cardboard, like in the description, but honestly I woudln't have known if it hadn't said so, it is so sturdy and so highly shellacked (or whatever the term is) that I actually forget it *is* cardboard, it totally looks and feels like ceramic. And it is absolutely LOVELY, better even than the picture!!! I bought one for my daughter for Christmas, then had to buy another one for me!"
5.0,"Dry winter has never been easy for my kids and I, we tried a few other name brand, nothing really works, even Burt's bees didn't work for us, until one day I encounter Badger's lip balm, it really lock in the moist and fix the dry spot on my lips. So I got this set for the family, I have to say this really helps to keep the lips NOT bleeding thru the winter."
5.0,Super cute!!! Love it!!!
5.0,These are so sweet. My daughter loves them!
5.0,Love and arrived quickly
5.0,"Great toy! Our son loves it! The side opens/lifts and there is a cute ice cream there, which is extra fun!  We recommend it!."
4.0,Used for a cat in the hat birthday themed party. Worked well.
5.0,It works as described... Cuts recycle time in half.
5.0,We love this series of books/dolls.  They are very cute/fun!
5.0,I just received this angel as a gift.  It is so very beautiful!  The figurine is much lovelier than the picture depicts.  The detail is remarkable.  This is a beautiful way to express comfort in the loss of a beloved cat.
5.0,So very cute.
5.0,"An absolute no brainer.  First, look at the price.  Then, ask yourself, do I want my flash to recycle faster.  If yes, then look at the price again.  Determine how much that will add to your overall happiness and satisfaction, and click Buy With One Click.  Yeah, i know, you can run two flashes from one pack, but why.  This gives you very fast recycle ability."
5.0,Beautiful dress.  Made very well.  I bought this for my granddaughter's Madame Alexander l8 inch doll as a birthday present.  I know she will love it.  Her favorite color is pink.
5.0,"Beautiful tissue cover. Colors are great with a variety of shades of blue/purple/green, could complement to almost any color scheme."
5.0,I bought this to accomodate with the PB960 Power PAck. This perfomed very well and the price can't be beat.
5.0,beautiful..
5.0,High quality
5.0,"quality, just as expected. My kids fell in love with the show this year and these trains work perfectly with our brio track as they are the same fit as our Thomas trains. These will be well loved! They love that frostini has a flap that opens."
5.0,"This tissue box cover is absolutely beautiful and matches my ""peacock"" bedroom decor perfectly. Good quality product from a great seller!"
5.0,Great! Perfect! HIGHEST recommendation!
5.0,My baby werewolf is one of the cutest things I have ever purchased!!! He came in pretty quick (sooner than I expected) and I love him so much. The diaper and bib are removable which I didn't expect thought the bow isn't (though I wish it was) and his fur is really soft and he's overall really cuddly. I definitely will be adding more of these to my collection.
5.0,Love it
5.0,I love it!!!!!  It is beautifully made......
5.0,I've used it for edc and like it. It is a slip joint. A very well made knife for the price.
5.0,good quality fast delivery
5.0,remplis son office
5.0,"We have the DVD's and books, now we have the plush toy perfect size. It easily fits in my son's backpack."
5.0,Very pretty!  Vibrantly colored.  Goes well with my decor!
5.0,My son was so excited. This Franklin stuffed animal is the perfect size and came in 2 days. Any kid that loves Franklin will love this as a present
5.0,Gorgeous pigmented colours
4.0,"Finally, a breaker bar with a small head rather than those fat ones. It works great but it's is a bit shorter than I should have gotten in hindsight.

This also seems just as sturdy but I've haven't had to really test it yet. Will update when I do."
5.0,I've been looking for an orange and white angel kitty and I found this beautiful statue instead and I love it!
5.0,Very cute and good quality. Very satisfied!.
5.0,"Really please with this.  The details are sharp, clear and fine.  I'm not sure how it would hold up outside even with a weather proof spray (recommended), but it's so nice that I.m keeping it inside on my fireplace mantle."
5.0,Fit beautifully.  My granddaughter loved it.
5.0,Easy to apply and blend - stays on all day until you take it off. Love this product!!
5.0,Arrived on time and performed to expectations
5.0,My girlfriend loved it!!
5.0,Awesome
5.0,I use this to spray my dog beds and furniture where my pets have been.  It is such a fresh scent.  I wish it came in a bigger size though.  I cannot find it in stores around here.
5.0,I have the entire collection of Vamplet babies. They are all very well made and very cute. There is an entire comic book series with the Vamplets which I also recommend. They are great for kids of all ages even the ones who are over 40 like myself. The bottle of blood is like the old milk bottles we had as kids when you turn it upside down it magically disappears then refills again. The catch is for the Vamplets it's a bottle of blood. It's not to gross or scary for little kids though.
5.0,Awesome toy
5.0,We love Howliss and all the other Vamplets!
5.0,"I actually got Howliss before she was available on Amazon. (Totally not being a hipster, I swear!)
My teenager absolutely LOVES Howliss, and she's upstairs in her room chilling out with many other stuffed animals. Which she likely tortures (joking, come on) during the night. I love with this comes with a play baby bottle, but of 'blood.' So awesome!"
5.0,Does what it states...effectively halves the recycle time for my 360 ws pack...perfect...
5.0,Small but really cute
5.0,They work as advertised.
5.0,"VERY nice knife for the price.  Had to spend a bit of time sharpening at first, but worth it."
5.0,Dope
5.0,Fun and cute too!! Soft and my little guy(3 yrs old) loves it. About the perfect size for him to carry.
4.0,"This is really nice to use, however, just not for me.  The color Saddle Shimmer does give fair warning, but even though it really is only a shimmer, it's still more then I like to wear (just a personal preference)  That being said, it does apply very smoothly and stays put.  I just wish this company would make a product that has no shimmer or glitter."
5.0,This Angel  is  beautiful.  I as so glad I chose this one because it is even more beautiful than it looks online. The detail is exquisite.  I recently  lost our 14 yr. old girl (cat) to bladder cancer and this will go on her grave along with some other memento's.
5.0,excellent
5.0,I'm so in love with giraffe! Can't wait to give it to my baby girl!
5.0,This is an excellent body splash. Will continue to order it.
5.0,perfect quality and good packing
5.0,Adorable! My daughter was really wanting socks and shoes for her Bitty baby doll and these were a great find.
5.0,"BEAUTIFUL!! I am so happy that I purchased this. I get asked all the time, which palette is it. Would definitely purchase again. I was hesitant initially, but it came quickly and without any damage. Great seller."
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this scent. I have been without it for a while now because Wally World no longer carries it. I'm so glad to find it here on Amazon and can't wait to smell wonderful again!
5.0,As good as stuffed toys can get!
5.0,Beautiful candle! Will keep forever.
5.0,Great knife. Amazing quality. But it is huge.
5.0,I was so happy to see my local bookstore carried Jellycat brand stuffed animals. They are really the most cuddly and soft stuffed animals out there! I wanted to be really prepared for my son's newborn photos and have a soft outfit and a soft stuffed animal that we could use throughout his life to show how much he's grown. I'm so happy with this giraffe. It is absolutely everything I wanted!
5.0,"fits perfectly onto the Neewer battery pack without problem. It is a bit floppy and blocks the view of the battery power lights, but not a big deal."
5.0,Excellent product. I love it.
5.0,Wonderful scent & extremely hard to find in stores. Few sprays whenever needed & your feeling refreshed & smelling very pretty!
5.0,Love this scent! Can't find it in stores anymore. Light and fresh for summer.
5.0,Anyone who has a a battery need this for 2X the power as a standard cord..Great!
5.0,"Very elegant! A bit of metallic to dress it up. Looks like made of heavy card board so I would be careful with an type of moisture, the only con."
5.0,My baby cousin loved them
5.0,Great
4.0,It does its job.
5.0,"Love it, Love it!!!"
5.0,Very pricey but these little creatures were needed to complete the set.  My granddaughter will get this out every once in a while and play with it for hours.
5.0,Love it!
5.0,"Ok I saw this advertised in a magazine and it looked so pretty on the model that I had to check it out. When I first tried it, I DID NOT LIKE IT. I thought it was waaaaaaay to ""metallic"" looking and didn't look smooth or flattering. So I stopped using it. A few weeks later I was told that you essentially ""dab"" this on the areas of your eye lid that you're wanting to add color - not ""draw it on"" like an eyeliner pencil all over the area. Once I applied it in small, light ""dabs"" over the bottom portion of my outer eyelid, I FELL IN LOVE with it!! Gives an instant smokey eye look without being too harsh. I wear it every day now. I have fair skin and light brown eyes and this color (saddle shimmer) is great! Just be light handed when you apply it and you will be fine... if you press down too hard it will look too harsh and bulky. I ""dot"" or ""dab"" the color in the crease of my eye lid or along the outer bottom lid then I blend it in with my finger tip and it seriously looks great!"
5.0,"Very pretty, has nice details."
4.0,very nice - our little loves them
5.0,Sturdy and cute
5.0,Get asked where did i get them all the time she won't go out with out one on
5.0,"Suprised Granddaughter, she loves it"
5.0,"Speedy delivery, works as advertised!  Thanks."
5.0,My son's favorite doll! He brings Franklin everywhere we go.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my niece and sister-in-law, they both loved it."
5.0,Very cute and characters look nice. I didn't on the bag since it's a gift for a 3 year old
5.0,I LOVE this palette!
5.0,Very cute!
5.0,A surprisingly nice knife for the money. It not only looks good it's pretty strong and sharp. It's a good little knife for old timers like me who don't want to carry a tactical knife.
5.0,Works excellent.
5.0,"These are the toughest clips I have ever gotten for my toddler.  In fact, it's my second time purchasing them - only because my daughter has lost some of them and they are her favorites (mine too!).  They have stood up to teething, being washed, ground into the sand etc. and look just as good as the day I bought the original ones.  I wish all of her clips were this cute and this durable!"
5.0,absolutely love this product!
5.0,cool
5.0,"I LOVE BARLOW KNIVES, JUST WISH THEY CAME WITH LARGER BLADES, I MEAN LONGER BLADES. I ALWAYS CARRY A POCKET KNIFE  EVERY SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY. POCKET. I LOVE THE QUALITY OF THIS KNIFE, GREAT COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH, QUICK DELIVERY."
5.0,sharp right out of the box
5.0,What a knife! And it's big! Very high quality. Requires a touch of oil and some breaking in to get it to open easily
5.0,These so cute! My grand daughter loves them!
5.0,This is a great addition to my sons growing collection.
5.0,We've been using this guy to drill anchor bolts for climbing and it's really done a great job. It's not to heavy and a single battery with a good new bit and you can get more than a dozen bolts drilled in even the hardest granite.
5.0,Cute as could be. We really do like these on our girl's fly-away hair. They look nice and help to keep her hair out of her face. She likes to look at the Peppa pig hair clips and select the ones for her hair each time. I think she is very proud of them and we are pleased with them.
5.0,I love the colors and great pigmentation in this Vanity eye Palette. The product is easy to blend and makes my eyes pop!
5.0,"My beloved BJ Kitty died one week before his 17th birthday, which was four (!!) years ago.  The euthanization process at the local vet's office was definitely NOT a peaceful process, and reliving that was not something I could do.  They ""forgot"" to cremate him, so other than a couple rows of photos of him on one of my bookcases, I really didn't have what I would consider a proper memorial for him.  This statue is beautiful, and the Kitty that the Angel is holding looks just like BJ.  I cried when I opened it.  Now it stands in the center of my Angel collection, and I smile now whenever I look at it.  I'm glad it's made out of resin, too, as Itsy-Bitsy (Bitsy for short) has knocked it over a few times, and not a crack or chip anywhere!  And, unless you actually pick up the statue, it looks as if it's made out of porcelain.  Quite pretty.  Thank you!"
5.0,This giraffe is so cute!  My son is very attached to it.  Would buy again!  Very well made.
5.0,"My go-to shadow now. I always used powders, but fell in like with this when I got one in a multi-item purchase.  Because it's a cream, it stays where you put it and doesn't scatter under your eye like powder can.  I apply from lash line to crease and then blend up and out with ring finger. Do this quickly because it does dry fast as Mally says, and it stays put until you remove it."
5.0,Works what it claims to do.
4.0,It said two to three days to ship and it took over a week for me. It's a new knife and new knifes are stiff and hard to open but this sucker is stiff at first and will take a while to get broken in. The blade is nice and sharp with purchase still could be sharpened depending on personal preference. The handle is comfortable and looks nice.
5.0,VERY soft... perfect size and my best friend (who is pregnant) loved it! Highly recommend
4.0,Ordered as a surprise for my son. He absolutely loved it. He loves playing with the zombie. Durable and soft. Exactly what I was hoping for.
4.0,decrease my recharge time works well
5.0,Nice to have. Refreshes the flash more quickly wich is nice for me as I shoot a lot of action events such as high school and college athletics in addition to dirt track car and motorcycle racing.
5.0,My son like it
5.0,"I love this eyeshadow so much, it is the only one I use. The color (Saddle Shimmer) is perfect, not too dark but not too light. The shimmer is visible but not overwhelming. The application is so easy, and it lasts all day. The price on Amazon is lower than other places. I buy two at a time because I never want to run out."
5.0,Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Perfect item for friend who had just lost her cat of 18 years.  Thank you.
5.0,For the Franklin lover. My Godson takes this thing everywhere. I may need to buy a few more as he is already in the process of destroying this one with his love.
5.0,"Work perfect, increased the recharge time"
5.0,Perfect addition to your child's Chuggington collection. Excellent quality!

5.0,"Great price, great product"
5.0,fine
4.0,Works well. Lower cost than other sellers.

5.0,Thank you !
5.0,Love it
5.0,My daughter loves them!!!
3.0,Good but $10 for a ugly zombie plush? No.
5.0,"This angel is precious.  It captures the emotion of one who has lost their beloved feline.  I display it with my cat's urn and plaster paw prints.  Once in awhile I light a small tea light in front of it.  Those who loved their pet (angel can also be purchased holding a dog as well) will appreciate it.
Packing was done with great care and shipping was expedite.
Outstanding customer care and service."

Recycle time for my Neewer AD-360 dropped in half, as measured using the completely scientific ""one mississippi, two mississippi"" timing method."
5.0,So cute! My daughter loves these for her Bitty Baby!!

5.0,"An instant favourite with my 2 year old. As predicted :) Cuddly, soft, super cute."
4.0,Like the plush but it was too small for the price
5.0,my son loves it
5.0,Very cool train.  The train flaps open up just like the really one on Chuggington does.  My boys love playing with it!
5.0,"well made, good price and very cute"
4.0,Good quality grandson loves the soft feel. I would buy again.
5.0,My husband collects cars and he loved his Tucker for Christmas
5.0,Works great.
5.0,"bought this for my daughter she just loves it , thanks :)"
4.0,"I'm so sorry that Wet 'n WIld doesn't sell this item anymore.  I hate when companies do that, but I am so fortunate I found it on Amazon.  This is a beautiful.  It does not last long unless you use a primer, but it's a gorgeous palette with the right combo of mattte shadows and shimmer."
4.0,very good
5.0,I'm very pleased. I recommend!
5.0,"Good product, feels very good quality, it smells a little strange at the begining...gues it is because its new...but the smell disapear with the use."
5.0,"I've been searching for something that is heavy enough to protect my lips during windy and cold weather, but without petrolatum. Badger is definitely it! The tangerine is my favorite! Typically, I often find the flavor of balms to be too heavy and ruin foods and drinking. These balms are flavored with essential oils which give them just the right amount of scent and flavor. They really are wonderful! This set is a fantastic way to try out a variety of flavors and it allows me to keep a balm at home, in the car, office, purse...pretty much everywhere I would need one. I wish they made a set with their cocoa butter balms. I'll be trying those out next, and purchasing more of these as gifts."
5.0,wonderful!
5.0,Franklin is an old time favorite
5.0,"For my aunt can't find this anywhere so I found it on here and she is a happy camper and I have smelled it, it's smells nice"
5.0,It was just what I wanted!
5.0,Love this stuff. My favorite lip balm. Great price
4.0,wife loved it.
5.0,Very good tool drills like a corded tool.  As a  contractor I use this all the time. Drills holes in concrete with ease.
5.0,Again another very cute item and by girls will love them and share them ...
5.0,amazing! the colors are popping great price too.
4.0,"nice shimmer, stays on.  too expensive"
5.0,"As expected, fast shipping"
5.0,GREAT QUALITY very nice. I recommend it.
5.0,Replacing my vacuum filter (after 2 years of procrastinating) made the vacuum perform much better. It was like a brand new machine. I will now try to replace the filters more frequently.
5.0,Arrived on time and as promised. Highly recommend.
5.0,The BOMB! A must have! !
5.0,This is a great product more than doubles the cycle time on the flash. Love it
5.0,shipping fast product great
5.0,My grand daughter loved it!!!
5.0,"Bought it in memory of a beloved fur friend. I agree with the other reviewer who said they wish there was  a choice in the color of the cat the angel is holding. But ultimately, it's the sentiment behind the statute that really matters--not whether the cat is an accurate depiction of the one we're mourning.

It's a beautiful statue and doesn't look or feel like cheap plastic the way so many resin pieces do. Well worth the price, IMO."
5.0,Granddaughter liked them. Thanks.
5.0,great addition to my peacock theme living room
5.0,This is my favorite shade of Mally eye shadow.  I have blue eyes and it goes well with my color.  Plus it is easy to apply and remove!
5.0,Great breaker bar. It worked great on on the job that I bought it for.
5.0,I bought this for my dad's 73 birthday and he loves this!!!!
5.0,dam good knife
5.0,Awesome
4.0,I would have rated 5 stars except there was a crinkle on one side that's not real noticeable and didn't send back but love it.
5.0,"I bought these for my granddaughters birthday. I was very pleased with them. Quality craftmanship, sturdy, great details and features. She loves them."
4.0,"Note that this model only has the ""two mode"" selector switch.  If you intend to use for chiseling/demolition, buy the unit with all three -- rotary hammer, HAMMER, and rotary.  Been using the portable Bosch hammer drills for some years and remain a fan."
5.0,I love the variety of this set: six different flavors so I can rotate through them. Badger Lip Balms go on smoothly and work great!
5.0,Item came in fast and was as expected.  Son loves it.
5.0,Highly pigmented and the price was ok. Shipping was fast. Think I need the other color icon palettes from this brand.
5.0,Cute
5.0,"I was hesitant to buy these because I swore off the stick form of lip balm a decade ago because I found them drying, with my lips peeling off multiple times a day, and also I experienced a lot of throat irritation when I swallowed any (which necessarily happens). I am a bonafide limp balm ADDICT, to the point that even new acquaintances would comment on the frequency of my usage within hours of meeting me. I used petrolatum for years because it was the only thing that worked for my extremely sensitive lips that would literally break out in a rash around the edges within hours of too little moisturization.

I started to get concerned about the effects of long term, extremely frequent usage of a petroleum based product, that I was not only applying topically but of course ingesting at an alarming rate.

The Badger lip balms rated very well on the EWG cosmestics site, and I accepted early on in my quest for healthier living that I would have to take some risks with my pocketbook (at least not my body!) and make a few sacrifices in terms of convenience and results, so I went ahead and ordered this 6-pack.

I am beyond thrilled with the results. My number of lip balm applications per day is probably less than half of what it was before. While I still experience more drying with these than with petrolatum, it is nothing like the synthetic, heavily waxed-based sticks out there. I think they are probably much higher in oil (first ingredient) than wax (second ingredient--but all natural organic bee's wax!) and laden with other moisturizers (aloe). The cosmetic result is also a lot better--with thorough application I get a beautiful lip-gloss look that lasts. I also don't experience irritation, pain, and visible redness when I go a long time without applying--just dryness, which is so much more tolerable. It sounds silly, but this is actually a significant relief and positive change in my life not to have to devote so much attention to preventing my lips from hurting.

Not all of the flavors/scents are my cup of tea (the vanilla and the mint are not ones I'd pick), but the others are amazing--very light on taste and the scents are lovely and not overpowering. I also like that there are 6 in this pack--it's a strange sort of relief to not worry about if I have my lip balm with me at all times--6 is enough to have one in my purse, one at work, one by my chair at home, one on my nightstand, one at my vanity, and a spare!"
5.0,"The best eyeshadow I've used. Long-lasting and easy to use, plus the shade is just the right balance (for me) between too light & too dark. It's a neutral with an edge, and I've seriously only used this eyeshadow since buying it. Won't use another, unless it's another Mally, and I'd have to swatch the shade first, but this is a great bargain here compared to in store! Love it so much!"
5.0,I like this product. I haven't used it as an eye shadow yet. I've been using the darker brown to fill in my eyebrows and it looks very natural with my medium brown hair.
5.0,Awesome little train for the little engineers.
5.0,Like them
5.0,Very pleased with the quality. My granddaughter loved it!
5.0,"Just sent this to my father after a long discussion about the ""Tucker Torpedo.""  He just called me today and raved about how well it was packaged, and how much detail this car model had!  I am thrilled, via my dad, with the purchase. (I sent it directly to him, but he called me and filled me in)  Apparently, the car was so well packaged that it was stabilized with screws so it would not move in transit. (ie, you need some tools to get it out!)  Overall, very pleased with this purchase..."
5.0,Grandsons love it. Thank you
4.0,"As with the other Chugginton trains from this line, Frostini is larger than standard trains and will not fit into any small tunnels or buildings if you have a train set. It still works on the wooden tracks and of course can be played with anywhere else. It has held up well so far."
5.0,why wet and wild discontinued this color pallet is beyond me. the colors are rich in pigment and a little goes a long way. I love that I can find things on amazon!
5.0,My son loves this toy. He greatly enjoys how the side opens up and you can see ice creams and buttons/levers inside. It doesn't fit under some of our older thomas tunnels though.
5.0,I just replaced my Hoover Wind Tunnel filter with this one. It is liking having a new vacuum cleaner. I had no idea it would make a such a big difference in suction power. I would not pay $30 for one at Walmart. This filter is a fraction of the cost and works great.
5.0,"Beautiful knife, perfect finish and solid open and close. Im surprised it doesnt have a usa stamp because i have usa knives with half of the good finish this has. The steel is razor sharp just like all rough riders. I will be getting more"
5.0,"This sucker is big! It's got some good weight to it, and just like all Rough Rider knives, it's sharp enough to shave with as soon as you get it! This is a great knife! It's made well and I love these Rough Rider knives. I bought this one for my stepson that was always remarking how much he liked my Rough Rider knives. He loves it! You really have to buy a Rough Rider knife to appreciate the craftsmanship!"
5.0,My wife loves these!! she has different sensitivities to products these have been amazing for her she absolutely loves them!!!
5.0,Perfect third-party filter fit for my hoover vacuum. It is very affordable and useful. Will purchase more when the time's up for another replacement.
5.0,It definitely speeds up the recycle time of my Godox 360. Probably doubles it. At this price it is a no-brainer.
5.0,"My daughter is 35 years old and I gave her this Vamplet!  She makes her bed so it can sit there and watch her, she loves it!"
4.0,This is a really cute toy. My son loves it and he loves Plants vs. Zombies. Good quality and price. Shipping took forever though.
4.0,"bought this for a great price here on Amazon. I like the fact that this charger will handle my 6 and 7 cell batteries. The choice between 1, 2 and 4 amp charging is also a great feature. The charger has alot of auto features built in, such as auto peak detection charging (just plug the battery in and let it charge - it will cut off when charged), auto trickle when fully charged and auto shut off 90 mins after trickle starts. has wall plug as well as alligator clips for charging off of a car/marine battery, as well as the capability to charge radio batteries for gas cars/planes (I run electric cars, so I don't use this feature)

The only drawbacks are: I wish the readout were a bit more intuitive and I wish it had a temperature lead ... two things that the cheaper tenergy chargers have, but for the price, what can one expect :P"
5.0,"GREAT LIP BALMS!!  FIRST TIME BUYER / USER OF BADGER LIP BALMS.  I HAVE USED THEIR MOISTURIZERS IN TINS, AND LIKED THEM A LOT, SO I FIGURED HOW COULD I GO WRONG WITH PURCHASE OF LIP BALMS.  I LIKE THIS MULTI-PACK, I WAS ABLE TO LET MY TEENS CHOSE FLAVORS THEY'D ENJOY AS WELL.  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.  PRODUCT SHIPPED ON TIME & WELL PRODUCTED.  WILL PURCHASE FROM SELLER AGAIN."
5.0,Best line of trains I've seen for kids.  Will hold up to play in dirt and water better than any others brands.
4.0,Mr. Zombie is ready to play out all the Plants VS Zombies games in your home. He is just as described. My son has been dragging him around and showing him off. He is proud to say it came all the way from China. LOL
5.0,These were exactly what I needed. Better than the original that came with my vacuum. Fantastic price. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"Big, rock solid, strong spring and really handsome, only 440 stainless steel, but easy to sharpen, cant find any flaws in this knife.  20 minutes on a stone and its shaving sharp, saw cut bone handle is really nice."
5.0,This is a great neutral eye palette! I really wish that WnW would bring this back. I think I want another!
5.0,"You shelled out $200 for the PB 960, so why not a few dollars more to cut your recycle time by 40 percent?  No, it doesn't quite half the recycle time as described in some listings, but it's close.  On my 360WS Streaklight, full power recycle is reduced from 5 seconds to 3.  On my SB-800 it goes from just under 2 seconds to 1.  Recycle times are nearly instantaneous at about 1/4 power on the Streaklight and 1/2 power on the SB-800.  Now I'm not going to try to convince you that this difference in recycle times is important very often, but at this price why wouldn't you get one."
5.0,These mice are being played with on a daily basis. The fur started to rub off and some tails are missing but that is due to the daily abuse these are getting. My child cannot live without them.
5.0,I bought these filter a long time ago and still using them. This is a fantastic buy for the money. Seller is very reputable. I recommend these to everyone I know who needs a filter replacement.
5.0,I use this for my PS3 gaming.  I haven't had any problems with this while my friends who have wireless ones do.  I found a USB extension cord to make this work for the space where I play.  Happy I made this purchase.
5.0,"I've been buying Mally Evercolor Shadow Stick  in Saddle Shimmer at QVC for years. It's the best color, incredibly flattering, lasts a long time and is easy to use. Works great as shadow or eyeliner.  At QVC it's $25.00, plus $5.22 for shipping. At Mallybeauty, it's also $25.00, but the shipping is $11.00. At Ulta.

At Amazon, it's $19.95 and no shipping fee with Prime. It's a new, packaged in the same way as if it came from QVC, the only difference being that it's $10.00 cheaper."
5.0,"Very powerful $73 no H&S charges , Does all that the others do for 100 bucks less. received it 4 days !

Use it to sail the Soling 1 meter RC Sail boats. have recommended it to others !"
5.0,"Such a cute train, even the sides come up. My child gets so much enjoyment out of it and will for many more years I am sure."
5.0,Good price for replacement filters  It's important to change the filters regularly.  The vacuum will operate more efficiently. Fast Shipping.
5.0,"A very solid, good-looking, smoothly operating BIG knife from Rough Rider. Excellent fit and finish. very good walk and talk. The spring was a bit too strong but seems to get more comfortable later. Watch your nail at half stop. I cut myself a couple of times, it is very sharp. It is worth every penny of its low price."
5.0,"I love this color and shadow. The brown is is softer shade and has a gold shimmer than is not crazy. I wear it as a liner and shadow and it lasts all day. It looks great and I can wear it with other colors if needed, but I like it for an everyday ""bare"" look that is a bit more polished."
5.0,I wanted the healthy option that successfully moisturized.  I've tried many and I am finally happy.  I will spread the word .  Thank you badger!
5.0,"That I never want to be without.  I'm one of those people who are never far away from their lip balm.  One in my pocket and resting in various places around the house - always within reach.  Until now, I've used another popular brand and like it fine BUT the Badger Lip Balm is better, in my opinion.  It has a very smooth texture and the various ""flavors"" make this an even better product."
5.0,"Everyone no matter what your complexion may be, should definitely own this palette,  it is soo flattering on everyone and the colors are very pigmented."
5.0,This right here! I ordered two more of the same palette! This does a beautiful clean eye and the color pay off is amazing! The colors are dupes for Mac Colors! Love this!
4.0,"My son loves the Chuggington trains.  My son and daughter fight over the Frostini, because the side opens like an ice cream truck.  Too bad it doesn't open on both sides."
5.0,"Gave to my grand kids for Christmas.  They really liked them and, hope to buy more of the families in the future."
5.0,All natural products with a very good texture on the lips. I have found that all badger products are of good quality!
5.0,"Ordered them for my self,because I use bager products all the time. My kids and grand kids seen them and took them all. Good product"
5.0,"I have used the unscented one that I bought from a store and it was running out. So I bought this pack of six because I would save more money in the long run than if I bought 1 stick. I like the Unscented, Vanilla, and Grapefruit. The flavor is mild but enough to notice. I didn't taste any chemical types of tastes when using the Unscented one (compared to other brands). sometimes I chew a bit on my lips and this balm keeps me from chewing on them anymore for some reason and also sooths my lips very well so that I don't think about my lips being dry or cracked. If it wasn't for this brand I would probably make my own balm (I have organic bees wax from amazon and Organic EV Olive Oil from a store).
The only difference I see now in the ingredient list compared to the last Unscented stick I bought is that the unscented stick (in this pack of 6) lists rosemary as being a CO2 extract where it previously did not list it as a CO2 extract (just a normal ingredient). It seems that CO2 extracts might even be better than alcohol or other types of extracting methods but im not an expert."
5.0,"I love this mixture of colors, and the pigment is great, there are so many different ways of wearing this shadow."
5.0,"Awesome product! Easy application and stays on all day without fading, without even using primer. Can't wait to try other shades!"
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE the scent of this body spray because it has a really unique,fresh smell......and because it is soooo freshly scented it when you walk into a room someone will ALWAYS ask ""what is it that I'm smelling...?? It smells soooooo nice...what are you wearing and what is the name of it???"" ....I want to get some!!!

Try some.....I promise you'll love it!!"
5.0,"I love these eye shadow sticks and can't get enough stockpiled, because I believe they've been discontinued in the Mally line, so I don't want to run out. They go on nice and smooth and give you about 30 seconds or so to smudge the color before it dries to a soft finish. These eye shadows stay on all day long - they don't budge and because they're a cream, there's no fallout on your cheeks. But they're easy enough to get off with a gentle wash and maybe a little eye makeup remover. Also, these make perfect primers for powder eye shadow - let the color dry and then just use your regular powder shadow like you normally would. Your powder eye shadow will then stay on all day as well. All in all, the perfect eye shadow/primer!"
5.0,It was A Christmas gift and he loved it. Just what he wanted. The price was good and the service was very good
5.0,Chuggington train for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and he was so happy with it. He loves Chuggington and Thomas and they are both great toys. So glad I got this for him.
5.0,"I was a strictly Clinique girl, but Mally is slowly winning me over.  I am a huge believer in her volumizing mascara, and this is the best, easiest shadow I have ever used!  The color is fabulous, and it is so simple to apply!"
5.0,"Good quality. Ive been using my original for long time,with these two new ones I should be good for the rest of the time I own the vacuum."
5.0,used this for my sons first bithday as a cake topper and it was too cute! easy to clean and very durable. cant wait to use it again sometime.
5.0,Very cute dollie socks. My grandaughter is going to love them. They are just as nice as little girls socks only tiny.
5.0,"I originally rec'd this spray as part of a gift set more than a year ago, but I really like the scent (and the men seem to really dig it too!). It's light, flowery and not heavy at all. It doesn't last that long on it's own volition, but I spray it on over Beckham ""Intimately"" and the combination of the two has created my ""signature scent"". I like the fact that it's so inexpensive. I keep the original mister bottle in my purse for a quicker refresher and buy this 4 pack as refills. A very pleasing scent ...."
5.0,Works just like the other two units that I already have. Love the trickle charge feature and ease of connection.
5.0,"I love Mally's shadow sticks. Have used ""taupe"" in the past, but I prefer this shade, Saddle Shimmer.  Seems more brown to me.  Mally's shadow sticks are one of the few eyeliners I've every used that truly stays on all day until you take it off."
5.0,I am so hooked on these Critters! My 3 yr old granddaughter asked for a house and families for Christmas and we bought a ton of them at Toy-R-Us with coupons. These prices are the same; some items are less! I'll be happy to play with her!
5.0,Pretty cat topper/decoration especially for birthday parties or fun kid parties. Perfect for birthdays and you can reuse the cat again and again!
5.0,"My daughter loves putting dresses on her dolls, and this is one of her favorites!  Fun little dress and very pretty!"
5.0,"Another train, kids loved it...fits on our wooden railway. very cute. They play for hours with their trains. Kid approved."
5.0,"My son loves Frostini!  When I bought it, I didn't realize that one side opened to display pictures of ice cream!  My son was the one who taught me how to open it!  And, like all other Chuggington chuggers, the pictures were built right into the plastic instead of being stickers!  I absolutely enjoy the quality of Chuggington products!"
5.0,Ordered these replacements worried if they would be as good as the Hoover brand and they sure are!  Very happy.
5.0,"After losing our almost 15 year old cat,I was looking for a little statue for my rose bed,to mark her burial place. This little memorial statue was just the perfect thing. It's not so large that it looks tacky,but just the perfect size to remember my lost furbaby. The only con at all was that I wish there were more color options for the cat."
5.0,I had a mouse house when I was a little girl and I know my granddaughter is going to love these little mice.
5.0,"This is a great car and an even better price. It is better than I expected, I love it, and will now have a piece of history forever."
5.0,"Just received this item today. Very lovely. Well made, a nice weight, nice texture. The details are very fine and tastefully done. Colors are subtle and evoke gentleness. This looks much more expensive than what they ask for it, and the back of the statuette is as beautiful and detailed as the front. I'm so glad that it's elegant looking. I bought it as a memorial to my own pet, but this would make a VERY NICE gift to give to someone who has lost a cat. So many of those types of things look sort of flimsy and cheap, but this is very beautiful and will be treasured and displayed."
5.0,We love all things chuggington! My 3 year old grandson loves these trains and so do I! Will buy many more!
5.0,"Arrived in 2 days from order. At first I was skeptical about washable filters, but I rinsed it out with the sprayer at the kitchen sink and let it air dry. Works great! I would definitely order these again and at a fraction of the cost of the OEM filter. I am a happy customer."
5.0,I searched everywhere for a Dr. Seuss Cake topper and this was PERFECT!!!!  It made my boy's first Birthday cake AMAZING!!!
5.0,This is the palette I use everyday for my natural look.  The colors are very pigmented and last all day.  I do not know why Wet-N-Wild discontinued these palettes.  I definitely love this palette.  Hurry and order your palette before they will no longer be available.
5.0,Was perfect for my son's cat in the hat cake. Was not cheap quality and he still has the cat.
5.0,I'm loving the Mally make-up products and this eyeshadow stick is definitely a great color and texture - easily applied!!
5.0,"Good quality toy.  These seem to get little scratches on them easier than Thomas trains, but I believe that is more due to the boxy shape."
5.0,Perfect for my son's first birthday that was Dr. Seuss themed. We were able to burn a candle and keep the Cat in the Hat as a keepsake.
5.0,"I've only used it a few times, it's worked well thus far. I've not yet tried to wash the filter."
5.0,"Did a bunch of work on my car with this.  The finish looks nice, and it didn't break with me putting as much force as I possibly could on it a bunch of times.  Would definitely recommend if 3/8 is your largest socket set."
5.0,"Grand kids loved this toy! Very well made, good price, solid packaging, will look forward to purchasing more toys! Recommend."
5.0,This Dr. Seuss Cat in the Hat Birthday Party Cake Topper and 6 candles made my grandson's party a great success.  He still carry's the cat around with him.  good purchase
5.0,I purchased two of these dresses to put on American Girl Dolls and give to my nieces for being flower girls in our wedding. The dresses were perfect! They arrived on time and were just as described. They appear to be well made and fit the dolls perfectly. My nieces loved the dolls and dresses!
5.0,These are the cutest little guys and theirs clothes are so well made and removable... good investment on our part.
5.0,This charger is spectacular at charging the smaller 1/16 Traxxas batteries in about an hour with the 1A setting. Works great out of the box. Status indicator key could be placed someplace on outer casing though.
5.0,I got this toy for my granddaughter and she absolutely love it. Specialy the music. The size is perfect and even it is great to play with her thomas train engine .
5.0,This is a great rendering of the classic car! Any car enthusiast or fan of the Jeff Bridges film will love it.
5.0,"Like others have said, this is not a child's toy.  An adult toy, yep.....and a fine one at that. Great paint job, elaborate detail and quality workmanship.  I bought it as representative of a by gone era and also as a nice shelf filler.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  Doors open, trunk opens, hood opens and all interior areas have nice detail."
4.0,very good looking knife. i sharpened it to a razors edge as soon as i got it. The knife just looks really good.
5.0,"I LOVE this product, I use it daily.  It can be used as eye shadow or as a shimmery liner.  I will be ordering it again as soon as I run out."
5.0,Bought this for my grandson for Christmas!  He loves it and it holds up really well.  Looks exactly like the Chuggington characters on TV
5.0,I have one of these i purchased through a hobby shop works great needed another for my sons battery for his birthday.
4.0,"These little mice seem well built considering who their target audience is. My kid has fun dressing, undressing, posing these little things. The only thing I think is lame is the clothes slide off the creatures' shoulders continually. This does not bug my child at all. But it does bug me. Maybe I can affix the world's smallest velcro piece to fix it, but  it would be nice if the little family had clothes that stayed on."
4.0,"I ordered this as a cake topper on my sons second birthday since I threw him a Dr. Seuss party.  My only complaint is that the cat in the hat figurine isn't actually a candle like I thought and the size is a bit smaller then I expected.  It is basically 6 regular candles (red and white) and a small plastic figurine.  It looked cute on the top of the cake but would have been nicer if the cat in the hat was just a little bit bigger.  Overall, I liked it and we did get a lot of complements on the cake but we had the cake custom made by a local cake baker so it was very cute!"
5.0,Bought for my son as he collects model cars. Hard to find ones he doesn't have. He really liked the Tucker. Nice collectable. Will be looking for another this year for him.
5.0,"How can you go wrong with any Mally product.  What I love best about these Evercolor Shadow sticks is that they truly last all day.  I put it on at around 4:45 a.m. and it looks just as great without touching it up at 9:30 p.m. when I take it off.  I also have very sensitive eyes, this is the first brand that hasn't caused my eyes to water and burn."
4.0,"The Amazon review wasn't clear that the item is washable.  Hence, buying two wasn't necessary.  However, I had a some Amazon credit and it didn't cost me much - so I am going to keep both."
5.0,I used this on my daughter's first birthday cake and it looked really cute! I didn't need the candles but saved them for possible future use.
4.0,"Wooden?  the main body is wooden, but the other parts are plastic.  I am torn about these trains.  I (and my 2yo) love the size and look of them.  However we  have several track sets (Thomas, Chuggington, and M&D).  These trains are a bit too big to go under the raised portions of the other tracks, and the magnet part is higher up than Thomas and causes the trains to derail on inclines."
5.0,My son's 2nd birthday is going to be a Dr Seuss party.  This will look so cute on his cake.  :)
5.0,"It was a fantastically designed model, well detailed,a piece of our history from tuckers endeavors of building a great american vehicle."
5.0,"This breaker bar appears to be well-made.  It has a large diameter for strength, with a high-quality chromed finish for appearance."
4.0,"My daughter loves this set. She dresses and undresses them all the time. They've accompanied us on many outings. We don't have any other calico critters nor calico critter houses, etc. They work well on their own with my child's wild imagination."
5.0,"I love calico critters because they are a fun toy that allows my children to use their imaginations and does not seem to be selling them a bill of goods. I notice that my children are calmer when they play with the calico critters. I am slowly replacing other toys, such as barbies, with the various items available from calico critters. Even my two year old (warning small parts that may not be good for some two year olds; mine is finished sticking things in her mouth) will sit down with the calico critters and play for close to an hour all by herself. I cannot say that about any other toy that we have. There is something about their cuddliness that makes everyone relax and use the imagination when playing them. I have not been disappointed with any of the calico critter products and neither have my children"
4.0,"I ordered this to top a cake for a baby shower.  The cake was an ""8 inch"" cake so it's size was fine, but if you are using a larger cake, it would be a little small. I felt like it was expensive for what you got (I didn't need the candles, however, and they would have taken up a little more room).  It did arrive in a very timely matter, though."
5.0,I bought all cat in the hat products for my son's 4th birthday party.  He wanted to have cat in the hat birthday party.  he loved them andmy father kept cat in the hat.
4.0,"This is the 2nd one of these I have purchased. The first one was out in the field being used for masonry drilling, mainly 1/4""-1/2"" holes. I also purchased the extended battery which is a good buy. The first one worked great for 4 months until it was returned back to me from my field guys. It was suffering a loss of power, I disassembled it and cleaned it all with motor contact cleaner. Turns out it was just packed with dust from drilling. Still works great, bought a 2nd for the other crew."
5.0,"How many times have you had to unscrew a nasty bolt and not had the leverage to get the bolt out or the nut off? This bar is the one that you need. 15 inches long, with a 3/8"" socket mount gives you lots of leverage to beat that bolt into submission. If you are a shade-tree mechanic this is the product you need."
5.0,"This rotary hammer drill is just amazing.  It is extremely light weight and drills extremely fast.  The battery also lasts forever.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a lightweight drill for up to 1/2"" holes in concrete."
5.0,"I saw this knife on ""pocket knives blog"".  I was a little leery because of the low price, & the ""made in China"".
The knife is very well made, & super sharp.  Great price, & great knife.............."
5.0,"My 7yr old daughter really wanted a pet mouse for Christmas. We didn't think she was ready for that level of responsibility yet not to mention we weren't too thrilled at the idea of a stinky mouse cage in her room (although our 2 cats might have disagreed). As an alternative, I found these little critters on Amazon and put them out on xmas morn in stead. She was just as thrilled and loves playing with this little family of mieces and no cleanup involved!"
5.0,SO cute! Looks like Cat in the Hat is doing yoga! We used this for our son's 1st birthday cake topper and he just smiled with he saw the Cat in the Hat! Great!
5.0,"I purchased this set of candles and cake center decoration for my friend who loves Dr. Seuss.  I am very pleased with the quality and it's as cute as the picture suggests.  This is a fun, whimsical cake garnish for a Cat In The Hat enthusiast."
5.0,"After looking at several retail stores,Target, Wal-mart and the price was staggering for a simple filter, my wife suggested I look on Amazon. I was astonished at the difference in price and bought 2 instead of 1 so I have them available when I need them. A+++++"
5.0,LOVED this!  Received safely & in a timely fashion.  I would buy from this store again.  This candle set went perfect with our Dr. Suess themed birthday party!
5.0,"I purchased this to sit atop my son's 1st birthday cake and it was a hit! I had originally thought that the Cat was a candle too, but it is actually a resin toy. No bother though, now he can play with it instead of the item being stuck in a drawer. Very cute!"
5.0,"My parents had gotten my two year old daughter the Cloverleaf Manor and also wanted to pick out a critter family for the house (even though the house can hold every critter known to mankind).  My dad carefully made his decision and went with the Norwood Mice.  I am glad he did, as I think they are the absolute cutest critter family.  The little outfits are old fashioned and adorable.  But their little faces...they are just too cute.  We also bought the baby Norwood twins as well.  My daughter, even though she just turned two, will sit for very long periods of time playing with her house and the critters.  Her favorite is putting them to bed and making sure the blankets are covering them up ""just so."""
5.0,The candles and figurine arrive in great condition and they were perfect for what I needed. I could not be more pleased.

5.0,"Im cheap so dumping big $'s into a headset just to play a game really stuck in my head. I purchased this headset, plugged it into my PS3 and it worked batter than the $100 one my buddy just purchased. I ordered a second one the other day for a young man who was sort on change...My buddy's kid brother."
5.0,My 12 year old son asked for a headset with a cord~and I got a great one!  He has had no complaints! It has a very long cord if u r someone who really gets into games and wants to walk or run around~this is for you! My son has a big head and says it is comfy and he really loves it.
5.0,"This headset is simple, yet effective. It adjusts to heads size/shape accordingly and is very comfortable. I use this headset for my ps3, but it can also be used with computer as well. (Online ps3 perspective: wired headsets are preferable to bluetooth in my opinion because you don't have to charge anything, its simply plug and play!) I can hear and be heard with great clarity. This is a highly recommended product."
5.0,"I am so HAPPY to have found these! They work great and are wonderful for the environment! I just gently rinse them off, then gently brush with a tiny bit of soap if really dirty and set out to dry.  I have washed each filter several times and they still work like new!! Very happy with them!"
5.0,This added just the right touch to our cake with our party theme of Cat In the Hat. This item arrived quickly and was priced just right.
5.0,I bought this for my grandson and he absolutely loves it.  He loves playing his PS 3 online.  He said a lot of friends had trouble with their wireless headsets so he wanted a wired one.  It evidently is very clear because he is thrilled with it.
5.0,"If you looking for a fancy and sophisticated headset with tons of features then keep looking because this is not your headset. But if your like me and was simply searching for a headset to talk online, then you search is over. Does just what I need it to do. I can hear others just fine and the can hear me as well. I play Star Wars Battlefront2 online and this is perfect."
5.0,"I checked out all the choices for my 8-year old and his military-themed PS3 games, and this one had the best reviews.
He loves it and it works perfectly for him.
He says it's also very comfortable.
It's his favorite present and he uses it every single day.
I did have to by a USB extender as the cord was stretched out at about 8-9 feet, but no big deal.
Highly recommend!"
5.0,"My 8 year old and 6 year old daughters love calico critters!  They have many other animals, but this mouse family is so adorable!
It is well made, and the cloth they are wearing is so cute too.  I am sure this will be their favorite toy for a long time!!"
5.0,"Many 40140201 HEPA filters out there on Amazon for Hoover upright vacuum, some even claim to be ""genuine Hoover HEPA filter"" but according to the reviews, many were disappointed to find them ill-fitting, or even bent during shipping. We have been using this filter for long, never got any problem. It fits and works just as our original Hoover filter, no problem at all."
5.0,"This is not a toy but a 1:18 scale die cast model of the 1948 Tucker Torpedo, one of the most advanced cars ever built. The model is not the highest end version of a die cast model but it is a good model for its price. Presents well, details are good. Paint job is fair to good. Missing the shifter stalk on the steering column, an important detail that should have been included. It captures the look of the Tucker well although the gas cap is in the wrong place for the majority of the production run of Tuckers. I'd recommend this to anyone who is not a fanatic about the Tucker's details but just wants to see the car in a collection to be inspired by the visionary design that was killed by lawsuits and corrupt political agendas."
5.0,"I ordered this model Tucker as I remember sitting in one as a child. Preston Tucker traveled the country trying to book advance orders. He had three to display, but only one had an engine and could be driven. Detroit automakers were fearful of the vehicle as it was years ahead of anything they had, so they exerted their influence over Congress and Tucker was forced into bankruptcy."
5.0,this is a great headset for ps2/3 owners.  there is an adjustable band on the side to fit any odd sized heads (not that my head shape is odd o_0) and overall pretty clear hearing quality and if you adjust the mic right people can hear you clearly.  i think its better than a wireless one because sometimes those can get a little weird connection wise. even though sometimes the wire can get a little annoy but you get used to it.  i would definitely recommend this product for others.
5.0,"The '48 Tucker Torpedo is an important part of American automotive history, and it is fitting that the industry came up with a nicely crafted 1:18 tribute to it.  Tucker took on the Detroit Big 3 following the close of World War II, basing his business on the proposition that the American driver would vote his/her purchase dollars for innovation and safety, rather than more of the same prewar stock.  The Torpedo featured such important safety precautions as structural rigidity, pop-out safety windows and seat belts.  Rear-engine rear-drive put the motor weight over the traction tires for superior control.

Only 50 Torpedoes were built.  Some of the facts are open to speculation, but there are those who suggest that the Big 3 stood in the way of Tucker acquiring steel, and big financiers stood in the way of production of the car Tucker envisioned.  (Catch the movie ""Tucker, the Man and His Dream"" if you can.)  You'll be impressed by the way this individual tried to launch a new automotive age.

Yat Ming has done a fine job with the die cast model, consistent with their other price midrange products.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tucker-The-Man-and-His-Dream/dp/B00004Y62V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tucker - The Man and His Dream</a>"
4.0,"I do like this headset its a good headset for the price. Its comfortable too. There are a couple of things. I have had my headset for over a couple of weeks . The speaker I can see how it would be very easy to break off however mines is still in good condition like new. When I first got it, it would drop or disconnect im not sure probrably the other persons mic though, because I haven't had that happen again . If you cant hear well, this is probrably not for you. At times I find the sound to be a little low. But its excellent for playing co op games just what i needed it for . Over all im satisfied with this product for what I use it for , my ps3 gaming . Has great sound when you are talking through it too, was told its very clear on the other end. Was asked all about it, where i got it, and what type it was by my co op partner."
5.0,"I have been using the mic for about a month now, and it has yet to break, All my friends on the Playstation network can hear me extremely well. And for the price its a definite buy."
5.0,"I bought this to use with my clanmates..we're a ps3 clan that sometimes plays ps2 games & this headset was a great choice. Haven't had any problems with it. Sound is good as is voice chat.
Shipping was fast & have had no problems with seller."
5.0,I got this for my video game playing addicted hubby.  He absolutely LOVES it.
4.0,"Was kind of skeptical about this headset because it isn't wireless. My three grandkids use and abuse (drop, throw, toss, etc) this headset on a daily basis and It still works and performs well. I haven't heard one complaint from them so I know it's working well. Using it for more than a year. The price was about average but the performance is way up their for an electronic component.
Would definately recommend!!"
5.0,"I loved these as a child.  I just bought them for my daughter.  She is still a little to young to play with them so I am saving them for when she is older.  I am so happy I found them on Amazon.  The price is great, and you can't beat no tax and free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime.  I plan to buy many more sets for her."
5.0,My son's step-daughter received these along with other items in the Calico Critters line. She is enjoyong them very much.
4.0,We have not actually opened this toy yet.  We are starting a collection for my daughter so she has lots of them to play with when she is old enough.  At 17 months she loves carrying the box around.
4.0,"These are VERY cute, but WAY smaller than I thought they'd be.  It said they were 6""+, but it turns out that was the size of the box - the critters are only about 2"".  They don't stand up very well.  So, to me, they are more just a cute little 'trinket' than they are something to play house with.  I didn't feel like I got much for over $22, but I suppose there is more there than it seems, when you take into account the clothes etc."
4.0,"My daughter loves Calico critters animals, and she plays with them very carefully. To that end, the Norwood family is a great neighbor to all the other families we've got. But I did have to fix many things once her friends came over and played with those: kids who are a little less careful find it difficult playing with those without tearing little parts off. I would say it is a great toy for kids who are around 5 and have good small motor skills, but not for younger kids (although I must admit my younger one is 4 and has been playing with those since she was 2.5)"
5.0,"I logged-on to buy one last, last minute gift for my daughter, searched for this product and clicked on reviews (as I always do).  In doing so, I came across completely random, irrelevant reviews.  The reviews had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS PRODUCT.  Instead, I had to read through numerous politcal and social commentary.  What an absolute waste of my time (needless to say many, many others time as well) and absolute turn-off to purchase the product I wanted to purchase on this website.  I am loyal Amazon Prime customer and can not believe the ""REVIEWS"" that were allowed on a product page for a preschool-aged product. Political commentary and opinions are GREAT just NOT ON A RETAIL WEBSITE.  I will purchase my products elsewhere if this is allowed by Amazon.  This chain of ""REVIEWS"" is absurd."
5.0,The logitec PS2 headset is excellent not only for the ps2 but also for your computer. It hookas right up and is immediately recognized. Works great!
5.0,My grandaughter Has so much fun with this set. Her Mother made a house from a box and she loves them she even named them and she is 2.
5.0,excellent tool have 4 other previous models and never let me down and i use them constantly you can not beat any of the bosch hammer drills corded or cordless awesome and very dependable. wdm
5.0,"I didn't want a bluetooth headset, because I hate having to charge them.  The cable is long enough, and the quality of sound and the mic are great.  Great headset for the price."
5.0,"I purchased the Milwaukee electric chainsaw five years ago because I did not want to store gasoline anywhere in the house.  Like any other Milwaukee product it is excellent and this particular item works as well as any gas model of comparable size.  It is surely lighter in weight than any gas model of comparable power.  For use around an area you can cover with a 100' extension cord this item is excellent.  The machine is quiet, powerful, and doesn't generate smoke and heat!
One bad point: it's electric and the cord can be a difficult if you're up to your waist in branches.  Also be sure to determine which generic replacement chain fits - as even the most comprehensive tool supply house didn't stock a replacement.(Oregon S57)
For the average homeowner working around your home on even the largest trees this saw is a good bet.  If you're out in the woods cutting firewood surely a gas saw is the better choice."
4.0,"I bought this floor scraper to remove leftover adhesive from old tiles on my basement floor.  The first couple hours were great.  This just knocked off the old glue easily.  After a little while, the edge became less sharp and I had to put a lot more effort into the scraping.

All in all, the handle is comfortable and it is a quality tool.  It just didn't hold up to hours of scraping against concrete."
5.0,This floor scraper is the bomb! I used this to scrape up the old linoleum in our kitchen. Took about 20 minutes to do the whole thing. Amazing!
5.0,"I actually bought this to scrape off the adhesive and backing  from the glued down astroturf the previous owners of our home so wonderfully decided to put down like 20 years ago. It works well, and it took some abuse from me. I managed to remove the backing from our 360sqft 3 seasons room in about 2 hours, and I'm a woman. If my husband had done it, he probably would have been even faster! If I had done it with a hand scrapper, it would have taken FOREVER and it woulda been pretty painful. I HIGHLY recommend if you need to remove some flooring! It is very well made, and definitely worth the $25."
5.0,"If you're looking for a scraper, look no further!  It's worth ever penny you'll spend on it.  I use this scraper for snow and ice, and it works wonderfully.  The angled blade allows for more work with less exertion than the typical scraper.  I recommend this scraper for any one, and have even purchased another as a gift.  Buy it now!"
5.0,I had been using a Iron and heating up the tiles and then removing what a job finally decided to wait till the Bully for scraper came and am I glad I did It took me 15 min to have the rest of the floor title up my kitchen is 12' x 14' what a great tool I would recommend it to any one.
2.0,We use this to scrape paint off the floor in our Paint room where we paint our Portable Storage Buildings. It works Great.  [...]
5.0,"it is a good product ,as advertised.."
1.0,Handle broke within 5 minutes of use.
5.0,Came in as expected.  Works pretty well for what it was purchased for.
4.0,Reason for a 4 is because the rubber top came right off on first scrape. I secured it back on with some silicone. Other than that it's solid.
5.0,"Works amazing - definitely speeds the process,"
5.0,Great for scraping up tile and better at scraping plaster off lathe!
5.0,"Heavy enough on it's own so that I don't need to do much more than push, it does the digging."
5.0,This is a weird tool.  I say that because I think there are a lot of things that this would work great on.  I used it to scrape glue off the floor after I removed the carpet and padding.  It made the job a million times easier.  I also think you could use it to pry up floor boards if you're redoing your flooring.  And you could possibly even use it to scrape textured ceilings if you wet it a little first.
5.0,Works Well .. Floor tile .. Gone
1.0,waste of money
5.0,"Works excellent.  So glad I chose this scraper, much safety around kids without a razor blade & less expensive not having to replace blades.  Works great."
5.0,"Absolutely the best money i have spent on a tool this year.  This Bully floor scraper made 15 minute job of removing old vinyl flooring (and glue!) from large room in a rental property. The leverage it gives makes all the difference.  The old vinyl flooring had been well glued but this tool got it all up with no problem, even for a 63 year old woman.  It was also the perfect tool to remove the quarter round trim all around the room.  Even though i didn't save the trim, i could have since it is possible to slide the tool along under the trim to loosen nails and remove trim without breaking it.  Highly recommend the Bully flooring scraper."
5.0,"It worked great in scrapping off two layers of linoleum floor, and it still held up like new."
5.0,"Does a great job lifting tiles in one piece! Minimal effort, maximal output."
1.0,"Wont hold up to even moderate, let a lone heavy work. I'm nailing down hardwood through out my whole house. I needed to pull up an old sheet of luan and an old sheet of plywood. This lasted 20 min before the handle snapped. I replaced with 3/4"" pipe. 10 minutes later the scraper warped and a few minutes after that it snapped. Finished the rest of the house with a neighbors 30 year old one. Short story long. Find an older neighbor who bought one back when they built stuff for real work. And borrow it."
1.0,"2 days of KILLING myself getting up glue, a friend feels bad for me and decides to help me. I swung by Home Depot picked up another floor scrapper for her....only then did I realize how HORRIBLE this thing was. If it's not picking up everything with one swipe it's not working correctly. I could have just gotten a dud....but I would have been done a day sooner if I had gotten the one from Home Depot first."
5.0,Very sturdy!  AMERICAN MADE!!!
5.0,This genius tool has done much more than its intended use of scraping off floor lineoleum! I was able to reach and take off a loose piece of paneling in the garage without getting a ladder out!  Used it in the garden a little too.
3.0,Bully 12-inch steel scraper works ok
5.0,Back and knee saver when taking up vynal tile in the basement
3.0,"Edge is not very sharp on arrival, but is a good width to handle at least 12"" tiles."
5.0,It worked great.
4.0,"A little bit heavy for what I need it for, but it works great."
5.0,Used this for taking up old school tiles and worked great. Now as a bonus can be used to crack ice for the winter
5.0,Really nice tool.  This scraped up 60 year old tile like it was butter.  I'll have the whole house done before I know it with this.
5.0,"Absolutely met and exceeded my expectations. Removing an asbestos tile floor from a 1950's kitchen. Yes, yes, I have my respirator, goggles, hazmat suit; just didn't have the right tool.  My husband found this on Amazon and it is the answer. Started out on my knees using a small hand tool, then ordered this baby. It probably increased our tile removal productivity tenfold. Thank you Bully Tools!"
2.0,Did not work as intended at all. Couldn't properly bring up tile that was easily removed with crow bar
5.0,This tool saved my life getting a foam roof up.  It is very well made and has the perfect angle to give you leverage to get under the foam and pop the foam material up.
4.0,"This is high quality. It wasn't ideal for me though. I bought it to scrape wax off when stripping floors. The blade is very very, oh so slightly bent from the middle out. I imagine this is to make it more effective at ripping up actual tile, flooring etc. For that purpose it's 100% effective."
5.0,"Good scraper, quality product"
5.0,"This tool not only worked well and was used to remove the tile, the vinyl, partial board, and old hardwood flooring. It also works very nicely as a driveway ice and frozen snow chipper and remover once the flooring task was completed. The fiberglass handle and its ability to bend actually assisted in the removal process over a unbendable metal handle. Yes, if I ever need an additional one I would buy it."
5.0,"Wow, a great tool. Tried pry bars and gave up. Purchased this tool and removed glued vinyl flooring in an afternoon."
5.0,This does the job perfectly.
5.0,Worked well for getting old adhesive off my hardwood floor.
5.0,Great product for busting sidewalk ice.
4.0,Driveway is on the north side of the house.  Needed a dependable ice scrapper/breaker to get the ice off the driveway.  This one will do the trick.  Very sturdy.
4.0,gave it a sharp edge and viola! strong item...
5.0,"Present for husband, loves it. Works great."
5.0,very pleased with the item and the service
5.0,"Used to remove old linoleum tiles, made the job a lot easier."
4.0,works well but it is heavy!
5.0,"Bit big for a girl, but I did use it and it worked really well.  Got up very old vinyl and was a great help in removing carpet pad that was stuck to the floor."
4.0,Did a real good job of scraping up most of the floor tile and sheept vinyl in my project.  Still needed the small hand scaper for some of the tougher spots
5.0,"Great tool! I got it to pry up the old cracked and loosened vinyl tiles in my laundry room before having someone lay a new vinyl floor in there. This tool worked like a charm! The blade edge is sharp and beveled in such a way as to make it easy to get it under the tiles. Because of previous water damage, many of the tiles were very loose and came up easily. But even the ones that were still stuck pretty good came up without too much difficulty (and I am not a big, burly guy. I am a middle-aged woman with very little upper body strength.) Next I'm going to use it to help scrape up the old dried glue after I pull up a carpet that was glued down onto a concrete floor in my house. Then I'm going to pry up some old tiles on top of a cupboard that are all chipped and cracked.

Plus, my daughter and I agreed that this tool would be a great tool to have in case a zombie apocalypse happens. Five stars!"
4.0,Heavy and heavy duty! Good tool to have on hand .
5.0,Great tool! it's a floor tile scraper originally but so far I  have edged my and my neighbors pathways from overgrown grass. Can't wait to see how me and my bully tool will perform for the winter when the pathways and steps get a coat of ice and snow! happy customer satisfied with my purchase
4.0,scraps great
4.0,good
5.0,"Very solid heavy duty tool.  I just got this to lightly scrape dried food off the kitchen floor deposited by my one year old.  This tool will last forever and it's amazingly effective.  I no longer have to scrub on my hands and knees or even bend over to scrape the dried gunk off the tile.  I am careful so as not to scratch the tile which is not glossy by the way, but this tool pays for itself in no time in time and effort saved in taking a tough job and making it an enjoyable breeze.  Dried food pops right up with light pressure because of the amazing weight and leverage of this tool.  For this use I would highly recommend this product although I'm sure it would be effective for much more heavy duty tasks"
5.0,"This tool saved me so much time. I purchased a house that had horrible linoleum floors that were too far gone to lay new flooring on top of. I purchased an random oscillating scraper, with much back pain and being on my hands and knees it worked very slowly and chipped the old flooring away rather than scraping up huge pieces. I went ahead and bought this bully scraper and everything started to move along at a fast pace. It is made very well, the blade is thick high quality steel and the handle does not bend even under strenuous scraping. Any equipment will start to dull while rubbing it against cement, but this did so at a much slower rate. I did run into two or three spots where the linoleum was heavily glued and would not scrape off, just a word of advice if you have access to hot water and have cement flooring it helps to mop on some hot water and let it sit for a couple minutes and it will scrape off like butter."
3.0,Very light weight for the duties it was assigned.
5.0,If you own a large walk in chicken coop with a floor this is a must. Cuts cleaning time to a third.
5.0,"My Husband really loves this tool, it makes removing vinyl flooring so much easier."
5.0,"Got this item to combat the icy buildup that covers sidewalks after snow/freezing rain. From my experience, this is the number one item that picks it right up without effort. This winter haven't needed it very much, but I have a rather large sidewalk and wish I had this last year when there was plenty of ice all around. It is well made, heavy duty but not too heavy to hold and use easily."
5.0,This is very well made. I use it to scrape the bottom of our 51 ft. ketch with a hookah unit.
4.0,It seems to work fine.  Wet the carpet before trying to lift it up.
5.0,Have not received yet but looks like it will work well to help me cut paths through ice and snow that falls off the roof. I have great hopes.
4.0,It works.  I should have googled how to remove glued carpet before using it.  If the carpet is wetted down it helps a great deal.
5.0,Fast shipping and a quality product !
5.0,worked great
5.0,"I had to bite the bullet to pay for this premium-priced wheelbarrow, and convince my wife our old single-wheel model had to go.  She was skeptical at first, but now that we've both used this one for a few weeks, WOW!  What a huge difference the second wheel makes.  And the construction of this one, compared to the two-wheeled Jackson we almost bought, is superb.  We only had to spend about $25 more for this one. and it's worth every penny.  I've filled it with 250-300 pounds of rocks, and had no problem on the steep side slope of our yard when hauling them to the back for dumping.  The thick tray is sure to last much longer than the thinner ones I looked at when shopping around.

A great product.  If you haul anything heavy, and want a wheelbarrow that seems like it might last a lifetime, this is the one you want."
5.0,"Moving heavy loads of sand, dirt, concrete, or bricks was always a painful chore with my lightweight single wheel barrow.  But this double-wheel beauty makes those jobs so much easier.  No tilting, loss-of-control dumped loads anymore.  Heavy duty construction, and it was very easy to assemble. If you really need a heavy duty wheelbarrow, you can't go wrong with this one."
5.0,"Shopped at all of the big home improvement centers. They carry another brand-although a very popular 2 wheel unit-but the  plastic bed does not have the thickness of the Brentwood. I wanted a construction type wheelbarrow and this one seems to have it all. The second wheel makes pushing heavy loads a bit easier and the overall quality of the unit appears to be exceptional. I use it for masonry projects and so far I am pleased with the purchase. Heavy duty handles and a much reinforced front end indicate that thought was put into this design. Again the old saying-""you get what you pay for"" and when purchasing quality tools I stand by this -and the other brand is good, but the Brentwood is just one step up."
5.0,"MY LIFE WAS EMPTY BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS WHEELBARROW.. I WOULD COME HOME TO AN EMPTY HOUSE..TURN THE TV ON AND STARE AT IT FOR HOURS..THEN THE BARROW CAME INTO MY LIFE ( I LIKE TO CALL IT THAT).. WE GO EVERY WHERE TOGETHER..THE BARROW""S FAVORITE PLACE IS THE BEACH CAUSE I GET TO PUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF SAND IN HIM..SOMETIMES ILL FILL HIM UP WITH ICE AND SHARE A CASE OF BEER WITH THE BARROW...I WISH MORE OF MY TOOLS WERE LIKE THE BARROW!!!!"
5.0,"Wished the handle was a little longer but seems very well made. Actually got this for taking care of unwanted reptiles in the yard, and should do the job well."
2.0,"Dull, soft edge.  Couldn't scrape off anything and edge visibly damaged within 5-10 strokes despite the no-sharpening guarantee.

Lightweight handle seems like a good idea but makes scraping harder since there's less momentum.  Purchased at HD and returned the next day."
5.0,STRONG TOOL. I am removing old floor tile and does this make the job easy. I wish I would have bought it earlier. Before I was using a chisel and on my knees. This pops the tiles up fast. Great purchase.
5.0,Very nice.
2.0,"It's just not the right angle for ceramic tile removal. The length is awkward when trying to jam the blade under the tile, and the handle is rubber which doesn't lend itself well to being hit with a hammer (to help get the blade under the tile to break it out of the mortar). I'm going to have to send mine back.

Best thing for this job seems to be the smaller handheld chisels with the handle-guard to protect your hand when you're banging it with a hammer."
5.0,"Got this for the dog kennel. In the past I dreaded the end of the winter clean up with what was stuck from the ice or left behind between snows, but this thing made quick work of it all. I couldn't believe how easy and fast it went."
4.0,was a trial and seems to be working fine.
4.0,Pretty tough tool
4.0,Good Quality and Design.
5.0,took up tile in whole house easy to use
5.0,"Heavy duty but not heavy.  It's a good ice cutter.  If you have snow, you need this. A shovel alone will never get you down to black top."
4.0,work great to remove title
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT
5.0,Good product though a bit overall for my uses. I will keep it and use it from time to time.
5.0,Very sturdy product. Originally ordered to scrape ceilings that were very thick with drywall rough look. Works great to scrape off instead of sanding and making huge mess. Wish it was a little wider but still gets job done. Plan to use to replace some flooring as well. Shipping fast Would definitely purchase again
2.0,"As a floor scraper for ceramic or porcelain tile this is a poor choice. It will only end up breaking the fiberglass handle long term. Floor staples it only rides over, so just pound them further in or pull them all...and that, is a total waste of time. This is fine for linoleum tile, vinyl tile squares and vinyl sheet, which it does state on the blade, but, not for the above mentioned tile. Even wood planks would challenge this scraper. I cannot recommend it and will return it."
5.0,this item is so great for removing ice. I bought it for my son and he loves it. This past winter it came in handy so much. Thank you.
5.0,"I purchased this product because I needed something with a larger surface area to clear a driveway faster. This product is just that. I was skeptical at first because this is a flooring remover, but on the blade the sticker advertised ""great for removing ice too!"" Well it surpassed my expectations and performed just fine. It is light weight and easy to wield. The blade can be resharpened with a file. Not a bad tool to have to clear ice from a driveway."
1.0,I bought this to remove a kitchen floor and it broke half way through the project. The handle broke right at the metal ferrule. I cannot recommend this product.
5.0,I love the angled head. It helps when chopping near cars and to chop from the side and lift chunks up. My last chopper wooden handle snapped off when my friend tried prying with it.
5.0,I needed something to help me remove big pieces of lino from a wooden floor. I was able to use this without damaging the floor underneath. It's not too heavy (I'm a 40+ smallish woman) to use for a few hours at a time.
5.0,"When I purchased this tool, I was in the process of installing ceramic tile floors in my utility/sewing room, and was prepping my kitchen floors for porcelain tile. This tool lives up to its name, and performance; not to mention it saved my back from much pain. Also, I love the fact that it is made in the USA."
5.0,"Dried cat barf can be like cement, and this is perfect for scrapping it off the floor so I can sweep it up. It's hard for me to bend over. This is my second one of these--one for upstairs and one for downstairs. It scrapes without damaging the wood floors."
4.0,"It seems well built, but it didn't shear off any carpet staples as I read in another review. I even had my husband give it a try in case it needed a more muscle to complete that task. He said the blade isn't sharp enough to shear the carpet staples. It did make the job of removing the carpet tacks a little quicker and louder than the crowbar method I used in the last room I did."
5.0,"I am not much on working on redoing flooring, as a matter of fact it was my first time. Worked great for me, easy breezy and even much more fun because it was simple to take the tiles off. There was one tile that I had issues with that I had to put some elbow grease in, but it worked like a charm. Recommend this!"
5.0,"i bought this scraper to help in removing old ""astro turf"" carpeting from a sunroom.this carpet had the old rubber backing to it,and when i pulled up the carpet,the rubber backing stayed on the floor.rubber backed carpet is the bane of any carpet installer.it requires at least several hours of scraping by hand if you don't want to go out and rent a machine to do it with. this tool has a heavy duty blade on it and takes an edge easy with a good file.now this wasn't the best tool for this job as i found out,but it worked good.i had an 8 inch razor blade scraper that i used the most.i have used other scrapers over the years,and this one would be good for taking up vtc,old tack strip, removing old pad staples as i am sure the heavy blade would shear the staples off flush to the floor if it doesn't drag them out.any blade will dull if used on concrete for a while,but this one held up better then any i have used before.the hadle is light,but strong,it flexed little when i was using it on the rubber back carpet.its a good solid tool,but as with any scraper...it will give you a work out using it."
5.0,"This scraper is a BEAST that is assisting me in scraping subfloor and vinyl off my kitchen floor.  In conjunction with a crowbar, this scraper is unstoppable!  Made by BULLY tools, this thing is truly a BULLY!!!!!!!  I love it and am so happy with it.  I am giving it a beating and it keeps on working."
4.0,"On our basement kitchen I installed stick-on floor tiles 10 years ago. They yellowed. Bought this tool to rip them up. It worked fantastically on the tiles that weren't stuck down so well, like on areas that we didn't walk much. On areas that got heavy traffic, the tiles were so stuck that this tool had a little trouble and we ended up using a hammer and chisel. I would buy again. But realize that it can't do everything."
5.0,"This floor scraper was delivered quickly,and was exactly as described. Very well-made heavy-duty tool,and I really appreciate the non-wooden handle with the rubber cap on the end. No more worries about splinters as it gets older.

I also like the fact the handle is so long. So does my bad back that doesn't like to bend."
5.0,"This is kind of a Johnny-come-lately review, but I think it worth getting the word out how very well this scraper design from Bully actually works in the field. This is one of those rare times where I feel I really got more than my money's worth. Made in USA, too.

The job it was purchased for was the removal of  three rooms (about 900 square feet) of asbestos-containing linoleum 8x8 tiles from a concrete floor. I rented an M-K electric tile scraping machine from Home Depot and thought I would clean up the corners and edges with the Bully tool. Where the mastic had been heavily applied, mainly in the center of the largest room, the electric scraper did help, but it also shattered the tiles into about 10 fragments per tile. On the other hand, the Bully scraper, because of its long blade length before the 30 degree up bend, did a super job of loosening the tiles without shattering them; about 7 of 8 came up intact. Even when a tile did break, it usually only broke in half. Picking up the full tiles went much quicker with less bending and stooping compared to sweeping up the broken fragments made by the machine. The hand scraped tiles tended to fall ahead of the scraper, so all I had to do was to stop every 6-8 tiles and use the scraper like a spatula and flip the stack of loose tiles into the asbestos disposal barrel. I took the M-K machine back early and finished the two remaining rooms with the Bully scraper.

I had no problem with excessive or premature dulling. The makers must have used good quality tool steel for the blade and heat treated it to increase the blade's hardness. While no steel can scrape concrete all day without getting a little dull, the cutting edge stood up much better than I expected. After the job was finished, I used a 4-1/2"" electric Porter-Cable grinder with a 100 grit aluminum oxide disk to restore the edge, and then only a very quick, light pass completely restored the cutting edge."
4.0,"Easy to use, leak free.  Saved a bundle by fixing instead of buying a new hose. Recommended highly for repairs."
3.0,"good but small i had to add an extra cushion to make up the space it won't tighten enough.
good but small i had to add an extra cushion to make up the space it won't tighten enough."
5.0,This worked great for fixing a leaky hose.  I just cut the hose at the leak and slid this on and tightened it.  It was that easy.
2.0,"good price and easy to install. not very durable. 1st one stripped out the threads with very little torque on the screws. the next one i just snugged the screws with another 1/8th turn past snug to avoid stripping. after 2 days use and about 15 minutes use per day the little sucker popped off the hose. Catch-22, tighten enough to hold and risk stripping the threads, don't tighten so much and it won't stay on. I'll stick to slightly more expensive metal fittings and standard hose clamp type repair kits. my 2 cents, hope it's useful."
4.0,"Repaired the end of my old hose after a sprayer got corroded to the metal end.  Just cut it off and replace it with this, works great."
5.0,I was setting up some 55 gal plastic drums for rain barrell's and foulnd that I could drill a 3/4 inch hole and screw the coupling into the drum near the bottom of 2 (or more) drums and connect them with short pices of an old garden hose.
5.0,"Pretty straight forward review here.  It installs fine, works well, no leaks, and is fairly sturdy.  Good and affordable coupler."
2.0,"it's a great quick fix-it item, but one has to be carefull and do not overtightnen the screws. They snap off the threads and then the coupling is unusable. In higher quality couplers all parts are made of metal (brass). Of course, metal is much more durable and reliable."
5.0,THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT I EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE & BRAND NAME.INSTALLED VERY EASY & NO LEAKS!I ACCIDENTLY BACKED OVER IT WITH MY CAR;NO PROBLEMS-GOOD QUALITY.
5.0,I originally bought some cheap connectors at Home Depot. Those proved to be worthless compared to the Gilmour Set.  I used them for a hose attachment on my basement slop sink.  There is no leaking with this set. Highly recommended.
4.0,"Pretty good, but the design barely hold the end on the hose when you need to twist and pull on it. Has come off before. Although games the first time it want fully seated on the hose, only about 3/4 of the way on. When I seated it all the way, it does seem to be holding."
5.0,"Glad to provide a positive review to this simple solution to a failed thread.  Just cut-off the hose, and use this new hose coupling. Will save you lots of money.  No need to throw-away an old hose with broken threads.  This is cost-effective for older hoses."
5.0,Great fix for my hose
5.0,"An inexpensive way to fix a burst hose.  I had another one of these on my hose, but it was metal.  When the hose burst further down, I couldn't get the metal hose mender off to move it because the screws had fused to the metal body.  I have had to move this one several times, since my super long hose tends to burst during the hot summer.  It comes apart and screws back together quickly.  It's a cheap fix until the hose gets too short and needs to be replaced."
4.0,Works fine!
5.0,"exactly as described, I will buy more from them"
5.0,works as it should. nice and strong plastic
5.0,Works exactly as expected.
5.0,A great product that works .
4.0,"Color is different, so if that's important to you, it will be green and not black. Didn't matter to me. I bought two of these and found them to be much better than replacements I've bought before, even though these are not metal. I'm not sure if they will hold up, but I've had others that lasted a few years so I'm not worried. Be sure to get the connector all the way into the hose, it's a struggle (which is a good thing) so grease it up a little first."
5.0,Replaced a hose end that was leaking at the seem...cut it off and replaced with this.  Now I can use my hose nozel and not get soaked from water running down my arm.  Very happy with it and I didn't even have to make a trip to the store.  Amazon prime rocks.
5.0,Works as expected.
5.0,Well made and easy to install. This product is so much better than the brass fitting with metal radiator type hose clamp which constantly cuts my hands when I'm use and always needs to be tightened. I liked this so much I bought another one the next day!!
5.0,This worked perfect for me I was not gonna buy another hose. Easy to put on and no drip or leak. The price is great so I will buy more in case it snaps during the summer from the hose being dropped on the floor sometimes. How can anyone complain about this quick fix? and so cheap at least it works so you can save up for a darn whole new hose.  lol  Works for me......thank you
4.0,As described.  Screws turn a little hard
5.0,works great so far
5.0,"Good Product, Good Price, Good Delivery."
5.0,none
5.0,Works as it should good price
5.0,This little thing is simply and it works. Installation took literally 2 minutes and all I needed were a knife and a flathead.
5.0,awesome
5.0,Super easy fix for the hose I ran over with the lawnmower!!!
5.0,thank you. exactly what I needed.
4.0,Working fine
4.0,"I generally buy metal fittings and couplers when I can but this was for a yard hose which I use and move around less frequently.  I had some concerns the plastic would strip when screwing it tight to compress the hose, but I was pleasantly surprised. Been using these now for a few months and I really can't complain. Metal is best but these cost less than half the price and have held up very well so far."
4.0,Solved the problem I needed solved
4.0,It was a difficult to get it fitted into the hose but now it seems to be working all right.
5.0,FIX IT MAN IAM.
4.0,needed to make short hoses and these work well
5.0,Good.
5.0,This is working fine and was just what I needed.
5.0,Nice
4.0,No leaks. I've used quite a few of these and they are a good value for the price.
5.0,Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.
4.0,"I've used these for years.  A little pricey on Amazon, but there's no way I'm going to HD for one of these by itself!
Just assume that you'll need some lubricant to slip the insert into the hose.  Don't waste your time just trying to force it on.
I've been surprised that I've never stripped one of these before.  They seem to be a quality product that lasts forever, and
is very easy to install.  They even have the combo screw heads so you can go flat or Phillips.  MUCH better than going out and
buying a new hose."
5.0,Easy to install. Very durable. Doesn't leak. Comes with everything you need. Fits perfectly.
4.0,"Just what I expected. Cheap and useful. Some of these reviews are funny to me, what do you expect for $3.50? No doubt this thing is cheap plastic, but it serves its purpose."
5.0,Awesome! Thank you!
5.0,I use these regularly to repair my hose. Works great!
2.0,"Cheaply made, it broke when I tightened the screw."
5.0,Great deal.
5.0,Now my hose with a crushed end works again.
4.0,WORKS WELL
4.0,The clamps do not seal good I just used a hose clamp on it
5.0,Tough construction.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"Reasonably priced and easy to install. No leaks after installation. Knowing that the item was polymer, I was careful not to over tighten the screws."
2.0,Worked fine for the first week then started leaking. Did fit my 3/4 hose nice. Next time I'll stay away from the plastic.
5.0,fixed my hose in 3 minutes.  even crammed the 5/8 into a 1/2 hose and it worked fine.  well made.
1.0,Chinese garbage. Won't tighten up enough to keep the hose on. Hose keeps coming off. Put a SS car type clamp on. Not like the old one I had from years ago. Don't waste your money!
1.0,"The plastic piece broke on mine in a few months,,,,,,suppossed to be  HEAVY DUTY.....??
Why can't someone in the US design somthing good."
5.0,"These days a lot of things are not ""how they used to be.""  This is a decent compromise for those who are looking for two way hose splitter, that's not a complete piece of plastic junk, but does not cost too much.  By the way - a lot of the ""full-metal"" versions still fail plenty - they are made like they used to be."
1.0,I bought two of these from Lowes.  On one the rubber seal on the hose bib connection failed after a couple months.  On the other water leaked from the left dial control.
1.0,Piece of crap plastic sprayer. Pay the extra money and buy a metal one! This one sucks!
1.0,The washer included with the nozzle didn't fit properly.  Water sprayed out the bottom when I used it (it was a new hose) and then the nozzle began flying off the end of the hose when I tried to use it.  Can't use it with full water pressure behind it at all.  Do not recommend.
5.0,"this product arrived exactly as they said it would. It arrived faster than they said it was going to arrive. it was properly packaged and not damaged. I don't know how to get too excited about a lawn sprayer, but this one is just right.  bugs and weeds beware!  my only complaint might be the capacity of the sprayers much more than my needs are. I believe you can full this sprayer to 25 gallons I thought it might be like a 5 gallon sprayer its huge but that's fine.  I do not mean it holds 25 gallons, but will mix/dilute 25."
4.0,"I shopped around for this product at the local lowes/ home depot etc. And all I was able to find were 2 gallon for about double the price. This product does what it says, and was on my door step within 4 days! I would purchase items from this distributor again."
2.0,"Worked okay the first time I used it.  With the second time and about 1/3 through the solution/jar contents, I noticed it stopped distributing the mixture as the level did not decrease at all.  It even looked like it was adding water to the jar.  Noticed that the trigger area was leaking, too.  Also, amount sprayed did not fan out well/consistently, even though we have strong and consistent water pressure. It would start strong and then ... a pathetic spray.  Valve/trigger area very problematic. Will try to return."
5.0,"I own several of these hose end sprayer, they are well built and easy to use. I have found them to reliable and would recommend to any home owner."
1.0,"I'm using this product correctly and all that comes out is water. It leaves the vast majority of fertilizer in the jar and doesn't distribute it. Easily fixed but still annoying, the tube inside doesn't touch the bottom of the jar so you can't use the last gallon or so, ASSUMING that this would work in the first place!"
3.0,"Works really good, The only problem I have is you must remove the the top in order to attach the hose since it is one solid piece."
5.0,"The sprayers arrived on time, in a ridiculously large carton. They work very well, and I am glad that they are still available, as I had been told that they were discontinued."
5.0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-Group-390DIB-Do-it-Lawn-Sprayer/dp/B000CZ2YQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour Group 390DIB Do it Lawn Sprayer</a>

I bought all 3 of these hose end sprayers they work grrrate."
5.0,I have only used it once but it did what the manufacturer claimed it would do.
4.0,This nozzle was a good price and it attached nicely to the hose with no leaks.  It works just as advertised.  I've had it for about a month and I use it almost daily.
5.0,Perfect for boat washdowns when you need variable spray control.
5.0,"I really like it.  It doesn't leak and it goes from a wide spray to a narrow harder spray depending on how hard you press.  Some products you turn to determine the exact pressure at all times, this is not one of those."
5.0,I love this one.
5.0,"Great for the Price, buy extras.
They last as long as the more expensive ones, and you won't mind loosing or breaking one either."
5.0,They work great..price was great..
5.0,This nozzle has been so great this season.
5.0,It ie what I expected
5.0,No problems at all. Quick shipping.
5.0,Great product and price.
1.0,"Didn't work, would siphon the solution out of the resivior."
1.0,I ordered this product and the part that sprays out the water is not working and I had to contact Gilmour to be able to get a replacement part. Plus Gilmour is going out of business and will not be Bosch company I think. They said they will send me the replacement part. It was so disappointing to have a new sprayer and it would not spray the fine spray mist but it sprayed water.
5.0,Received on time. Great
5.0,"Easy to use, doesn't leak."
5.0,Thanks
5.0,Great!
1.0,Had no water pressure at all. When tried to turn dial to up the pressure it broke and water starting spraying everywhere. It broke before I even got to use it.
3.0,spray is very puny and weak no matter what the water pressure....will continue to troubleshoot
5.0,Bottle works well and is much cheaper than buying from the original site.
3.0,"I ordered two of these.  One was fine, but the other had a hairline crack at the base which caused a leak.  I was forced to repair it to make it usable.  I used a patch kit from an inflatable mattress and it's held up - so no leaks now.  These are very handy for spraying soil conditioner, fertilizer and similar liquids which require dilution."
2.0,"Worked just fine at first, but once you get to the bottom of the sprayer it doesn't seem to pull the liquid out."
1.0,Didn't work??? Water just drizzles out. Waste of money.
1.0,"I have to admit I gave all mine away that I purchased. I like to mix up my own lawn food from some of Jerry Bakers recipes, stuff that requires soap, lawn food, ammonia, mouth wash etc... Well this is supposed to be a 20 gallon sprayer, meaning when 20 gallons passes thru the sprayer the container should be empty..
I could spray this forever and nothing would ever seem to empty from the sprayer. I would disconnect the bottle and see the material drawing up the straw, so I know it was sucking, but the bottle never emptied or more like a 100 gallon sprayer as it would take forever which dilutes the mixture. I think for what I was using it for it wasn't strong enough to draw the solution out of the container and actually spray it.. Maybe it has enough to draw up the straw but never enough to mix with the water. Otherwise I can't explain how I could water my lawn about 2500 Sq Ft for say 25 min and the bottle remained full..
I had 3 of these and all of them were the same.. I tried all bottles and had the same issues, nothing was being drawn from the cup. With the soap mixture I could spray this right up against a tree and I SHOULD see some soapy solution, but I don't see anything resembles what I put in the cup...
Now maybe these were not designed for what I am spraying, but there are the same Jerry Baker sells, or looks the same..
I finally got a Chameleon brand sprayer and it empties in basically 15 min, so there is a difference...
Don't waste your money unless what you are spraying is VERY thin.."
4.0,"Great product as far as size and durability. I'm only giving this 4 stars because the tiny hole that the content sprays out of. I really wanted, or needed, something that had a wide angle spray. My fault - I should have looked at the item closer. Worked great and very durable had I only needed a single stream spray."
1.0,Very little pressure comes out of this sprayer. The sprayer dose not spray. Water comes out in a single stream. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WASTE MONEY!
5.0,Is a great sprayer!!We have used it several times since ordering it!!!
1.0,"Was looking forward to useing it for my yard.  But it just didn't work!  There appears to be a problem with the spray mechanism itself because water only dribbled out although if I rocked the on/off thumbscrew back and forth it would spray water than die off again. Pressing the thumbscrew forward hard allowed a little more water to come out but that would obviously brake it over time.  Very little water was comeing out of the end with a hard pressing on the valve.  It doesn't draw the mixture out of the container.  Big disappointment!  I haven't as of yet made any returns on a purchase, so not sure of amazons return policy.  Ill have to check, and update as to how easy it is and weather ill have to pay for return shipping.  UPDATE 7/18/14 :  In order to apply for a return you go to the RETURN CENTER, choose the item to be returned, and in the box for reason for return -select you're reason.  So i selected- Defective/ Does not work properly.  Then you write a short e-mail to the shipper for what you wish for and reason and waite for a responce back from shipper.  Heres the responce i got back.  If the sprayer has been used, I'm afraid it can't be resold so we can't accept it as a return.
  But if you never used it, simply mail it back with a note asking for a refund and we'll issue one no problem. I believe you can have it shipped for just a few dollars using First Class Mail.

Apparently defective items don't qualify for returns, and theirs no way to know if its defective without trying it out first."
2.0,"I purchased this through Wal-Mart because the price was cheaper, even with my Prime membership for free shipping, because Wal-Mart has a free ship-to-store policy. Unlike many people reviewing the sprayer, mine came with all the attachments and connected to the hose without any leaks.

However, it would not spray. It's not that it wouldn't take up the mixture in the reservoir, as some people have complained, but rather there appears to be a problem with the spray mechanism itself because water only dribbled out although if I rocked the on/off thumbscrew back and forth it would spray water than die off again. Pressing the thumbscrew forward hard allowed a little more water to come out but that would obviously brake it over time.

I disassembled the nozzle as much as possible, which entails removing the O-ring and pulling out the white flow control valve. Was unable to see any problems with it, and the little plastic ball that appears to be the actual working mechanism seems to be working okay in that t moved freely in its chamber. So I'm not sure what the issue is other than it may be a piece of crap from the get-go. I did buy it because an acquaintance had one and extolled its virtues, but his is a few years older so it may have been better constructed. As a lot of current comments are reporting problems, there may have been a change in manufacturing (and standards), which doesn't bode well for the product."
2.0,"The quality of the 20gal sprayer I received is throw away manufacturing at its finest, the head leaks like a sieve and the dial won't stay open so I have to leave my thumb on it to keep it spraying. I don't know what happend to Gilmours quality control but this is not the same Gilmour my father used for 20+ years, owell I guess its another lesson learned in ""you get what you pay for""."
2.0,"It would take hours to do the lawn with this.  It just has a very small spray.  We wanted it for a trearment we are doing on the lawn, but does not work"
4.0,Measures rainfall to nearest quarter inch that's easy to read inside the house. Simple to mount on a post or in ground. made of plastic so we will see how long it lasts.
4.0,"We've had this brand of rain gauge for years, really like it, it's easy to see and accurate.  Only problem was, this new model has a different type of attachment, so we have to take down the old bracket and install this new plastic holder.  Hope we like it as well as the last."
4.0,"I bought this as a christmas gift for an adult friend and he was thrilled with it, then my nephew saw it ,he's 11, and he wanted one too, so I bought him one. The numbers are large and very easy to see from a distance and surprisingly very accurate! It's a great tool for a child developing a weather hobby. It's also very sturdy for the price you pay and it would be good for students wanting to do a science project."
5.0,I love my rain gauge.  It is easy to read and easy to empty.
5.0,"We received this rain gauge as a Christmas gift last year and love it!  Both of us are getting older along with our eyes so  the large numbers and bright-red float make it easier to read even from a distance.  Our gauge is about 30 feet from our kitchen window and we have no trouble reading it clearly.
If you enjoy weather watching this is a great place to start and would be a wonderful gift for young and old."
1.0,"As the title implies, this product simply does not function as it is supposed to. It doesn't draw the mixture out, It just sprays water. So instead of distributing the expensive all natural fly repellent around my yard and chicken coop, I now just have a soaking wet yard and coop attracting even more flies, and a plastic ""sprayer"" full of ruined repellent.

I would not recommend this product to anyone. I just threw mine in the trash."
5.0,Very satisfied with the product and dealer shipping.
4.0,"First one arrived but didn't work right. I had to hold the on/off valve uncomfortably just to get any reasonably spray. The fertilizer in the canister did not dispense properly.

I requested a replacement and it arrived promptly. Second one doesn't have the valve problem and seems to dispense correctly. For the price and for a tool I plan to use only a few times per year, this is a good way to go."
1.0,"This is a review for the Gilmour 20 Gallon Lawn Sprayer 390 Teal/White.
It was received  with 2 parts missing (the interior tube and the black sprayer that fits on the tip).
I also ordered the  Gilmour No Pre-Mix Sprayer 486 at the same time, and it too came lacking some parts. Thats  2 out of two Gilmour products that were lacking parts. Obviously, there is a lack of quality control. Unit was exchanged, but why waste my time exchanging it?

update: The replacement came with all the parts, but the on/off valve doesn't work. Whats wrong with this company?"
4.0,"Good inexpensive sprayer whose main attribute is that it will spray high enough to use on small trees. I purchased an automatic mixing sprayer and found, unfortunately, that it would not do this. I remembered, however, that years ago I had a sprayer like this Gilmore and I also remembered how high it would spray. I purchased this unit and am now spraying my trees again.

Lastly, I do not understand the complaint about the sprayer not coming with instructions since the instructions are printed right on the bottle."
5.0,Worked just how I thought it would. Has a nice sprayer tip also. I would recommend to a friends definitely
4.0,"Good value.  I have used one for years and a friend wanted one of their own.  Use it for herbicide, pesticide, or even for soap to wash your car.  Easier than mixing and large tank and totting it around, but only if you have a long water hose and will not need to venture too far."
5.0,The item was just as described and very durable. It was just want I needed for my garden. Thank you!
5.0,"This little sprayer really does a swell job. It is easy to measure and fill and has smooth coverage from the spray end.

Patrick"
4.0,"Good sprayer just didn't come with the fan spray nozzle attachment. Otherwise this is a good product that should be sold individually, not just as an add on item"
4.0,"This Item worked as advertised and performed well, it performed as well as the Miracle Grow model but was much cheaper."
5.0,Was having difficulty finding one in my local stores so I purchased it from Amazon. Later I found one at a store and it was 3x what I paid for it on Amazon. It arrived quickly and I haven't had any problems with it. Glad I decided to order it.
4.0,Works just as described. I use it with the 20-20-20 fertilizer I bought for the new grass plugs in the yard.
1.0,Did not work properly when it came to mixing solution this product for what it cost was a waste of money
1.0,THIS WORK AS ADVERTISED. NO SURPRISES.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND. AND IS MULTI-FUNCTIONAL. I USE IT TO FEED MY GARDEN AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.
1.0,"Does not suck out the liquid. I've made over 12 attempts now to get this thing working but it just does not suck the liquid fertilizer out...the only trick that worked for me was to vigorously shake the thing constantly with the water pressure on max...which meant getting wet. Hey...a shower while fertilizing with the hose end sprayer, how about that! I would not buy is product again! I've heard the metal ones work better. I remember Jerry Baker swearing by this brand on TV and his books for his ""secret"" lawn and garden tonic concoctions that used household products, but many people now say online that he's a infomercial scam artist...It does not surprise me now!"
5.0,I use this to apply a homemade mosquito repellent to my yard. works just fine with out any issues. .
3.0,"I question whether this product works as intended, as there were no instructions or directions included.  It works good?  I guess so."
3.0,if you don't baby the plastic lever that controls the water flow on and off you will mend the plastic waaay to quick.  it's good for personal use but not for commercial spraying.
1.0,"Did not send top to sprayer, need I say more! There wasn't even a packing slip included in the box. Will make sure NEVER to use this vendor again! Might as well have taken my money and thrown it in the trash where this will have to go."
5.0,Holding up well.  I really like the readability from my house to the mount.
3.0,"Very pleased with the rain gauge, one thing that would be a real plus is if there were a double slot in the base to ensure visibility from different directions."
5.0,Perfect!  It was exactly what I wanted and had searched for in stores since my old one became hard to read after about 35 years.
5.0,"Excellent and easy to see.  Installs quickly, my old one finally gave up the ghost after 6 years of sun and moving around.  These are made even better."
4.0,Arrived on time -- easy to read - so far so good.
5.0,Buy this one with the holster. Just drive a painted stake in the ground and screw this on for stability.
5.0,Perfect. I can see the water level without going outside.
5.0,Wife loves it
5.0,Worked great! Easy to read from inside
5.0,"An old fashioned, non-electronic, rain gauge that is large enough for good data collection, and large enough where two seniors can read the numbers and gauge the divisions from the gauge (mounted on fence on side of yard) to our kitchen window, about 15-20 yards or so."
5.0,Purchased as a gift and my husband really likes this rain gauge.  It's easily read from the comfort of our window - nice large numbers!
5.0,Great product...easy to read from 20+ yards away!
1.0,"Received this new rain gauge and to test it I filled it part way with water - it leaked from the bottom.  The gauge as delivered was missing an ""O-ring"" at the bottom to prevent water from leaking from the gauge.
Years ago I bought one of these gauges and the old one came with an ""O-ring"" that sealed the bottom.  Obviously quality control on this new version of the same rain gauge is not good."
4.0,Easy to read in the distance.
5.0,Excellent
4.0,Good product.
5.0,Really like the rain gauge. Easy to read numbers and do not have to go outside to read it.
5.0,Nice big gauge
5.0,Arrived on time in perfect condition.  Really nice rain gauge and easy to read from inside the house.
5.0,"This rain gauge will replace an identical gauge that I had for many years.  It was broken by a spring hail storm,"
5.0,I had one before and it lasted 7 years and I really liked it so I bought another one.
5.0,I have had several of these.  I just have to remember to dump out the water before a freeze.  It is easy to see the amount of rain we got from the kitchen window. In North Texas there is rarely enough rain to make me happy but at least I can rejoice when there is some in the rain gauge.
5.0,GREAT
5.0,Great product. I used this same product 20 yrs ago. I was pleased to see it still being made.
4.0,Like it and recommend.
5.0,Easy to read from a distance and appears to be accurate
5.0,Best rain gauge I've used..
5.0,This is what we were looking for to replace our very old rain gauge that got a leak in it.  Arrived just in time for three huge rains.  Numbers are so easy to read from inside the house.  Easy transaction.  Thanks.
5.0,Very E-Z to read. Love the jumbo size
4.0,one of the better gauges out there..
5.0,We live this rain gauge!  You can stand nice and dry in your house and always see outside what the rain is doing.  It is sturdy.  Great to have if you live in a rainy area!
5.0,Easy to read at a distance!
4.0,Great. Just what I wanted
5.0,Good
5.0,I bought this for my dad and he loves it.  He can easily see the gauge from the back door.
5.0,This is a replacement for an much older E-Z READ JUMBO YOU'LL  LOVE This for Sure Thanks John
5.0,"I love this rain gauge! I have tried many other types, and keep coming back to this one. Very easy to read from far away and is very accurate!"
5.0,This is a re-order on these rain gauges. I previously ordered mine and love it. You can see how much rain you have received from inside the house with the big numbers. Ordered the latest ones for my brother and sister and their families.
5.0,Great! Easy to use and read!
5.0,Easy to read from a distance! Easy to empty.
5.0,rain gauge was ok  but box was bent up
5.0,"You can easily see how much rain you received from quite a distance.  I've placed only about 50 feet from the back door yet you could read this at twice the distance.  Using a couple of screws, I was able to attach this to our wood fence."
3.0,If you are in an area which does not have much rain like Montana then get something else.  We very seldom see rain in increments of inches or even 1/2 inch.  This is for those places that get multiple inches per storm.
5.0,Great guage.  Can view from accross my yard.
4.0,Just what I needed.
5.0,"Love it!!
Easily seen from a distance"
5.0,As described and works great and very easy to read
5.0,Great product
5.0,This item is exactly what I was looking for. Much easier to read from a distance than other models.
5.0,"I finally found this one again. The last on lasted 15 year. The small replacement I got only lasted a year before it cracked. This looks flimsy, but it very simple and hold up well to Colorado weather. Also works well with snow because it is so wide at top"
5.0,Love these rain gauges.  Easy to read from a distance and seem to be accurate enough for our purposes.  This is probably our third of this brand over 10+ years.  Really not an issue as the sun and critters like raccoons do a number on anything plastic here.
5.0,This is the perfect rain guage.  Easy to see from inside.  We have had several of them over the years and have gifted friends who admire it.
5.0,It's just what I wanted. I had one for over 10 years but I forgot to bring it in when it got cold. It's perfect.
5.0,Easy to read from a distance.
5.0,Easy to mount and can see from quite a distance.
5.0,replacing an old one we had for at least 10 years.
5.0,very readable even from a distance
5.0,"It is very easy to read the rain amount and I like that 3 inch opening at the top which is the same as the national weather service uses, three inch opening."
3.0,No ground spike provided with the gauge.  I requested and offered to pay for one from B&L but received no answer from them.
5.0,Great Value and great product
4.0,Nice jumbo rain gauge.  Wish the holder was metal instead of plastic.
5.0,I really like this gauge. I just bought another because I accidentally broke my last one which was probably 10 years old - maybe the plastic got brittle in the Florida sun. I have it mounted high on a fence post about 6 feet from the house right outside the window.
5.0,"You will like this rain gauge, great design for rain, you can put it anywhere, package was very safe, just need rain"
5.0,I love these rain gauges! They were easy for me to attach and so easy to read from the shelter of our porch.
5.0,This is a great rain gauge. Keep it in during the winter if you have cold temps and it will last a really long time. I will buy another one when this one finally wears out.
5.0,"I bought this one to replace a previous one I had owned for years.  This rain gauge is easy to read from a distance.  However you don't want to leave it out all winter.  A light freeze will not hurt it,unless it is full of water, but all winter will hurt the seal on the bottom."
4.0,"Exactly like the one it replaced. When delivered, before Christmas, the package blew off the back porch and spent the next four months wedged against a tree & buried in the snow. When discovered, the box was ruined but the rain gauge was in perfect shape. Thanks for a great product."
4.0,I have used rain gauges like this for many years.  I wouldn't have any other kind.
5.0,This rain gauge was exactly as described. Love the large numbers on the rain gauge so you can see the inches of rain from a distance. Seems to be made well.
5.0,This is the third of these rain gauges I have bought.  The Texas sun is not kind to the plastic and they simply fade and become brittle.  I am in no way dis-satisfied with the performance of these gauges.
1.0,I had to return this hose after using it one time.  It developed a hole in it immediately.  I had to order a different type of hose.
5.0,This is this best hose I have ever purchased. A quality hose for my garden at an economy price. I shopped at many local home and garden stores in my area and could find nothing could compare in price or quality.
5.0,Took some time putting together and directions were a little difficult to follow but once I got it together it works great. Seems like it will hold up better than the cheaper models which are more widely available.
5.0,"For some time I have been looking to upgrade from my Scotts broadcast spreaders (2), because they are difficult to push evenly on my large, sloping lawn and do not spread evenly.  The Earthway 2150 while costing much more is well worth it. I can quickly and evenly cover my lawn now. Its large balloon tires are great.  The 2150 is very ruggedly built and may outlast me - I need to include it in my will!  One does need to calibrate the settings for the specific material being applied as Earthway discusses."
5.0,I used it for the first time last month and am very happy with it. It spreads very nice and with the big tires it is easy to push. It looks like it is well made and will last for a very long time.
5.0,Great.  I can read it from the porch without going out in the rain.
5.0,"The plastic gets a little foggy after a couple years, but I love it and just reordered more for the future"
5.0,This is about as good as it gets for the price. I mounted it on our fence so I can read it from my back door without getting rained on. The large print and red floater make it easy to read from 20 feet away.
5.0,easy to see
5.0,Easy to see and read.  Mounted it on the deck railing outside the kitchen window and empty it after storms.  Easy to eyeball rain totals to about 1/10th of an inch...good enough for our purposes.
5.0,Love this rain gauge
5.0,Perfect range gauge. Easy to read.
3.0,No mounting bracket included.
4.0,"I have had these before, great gifts for older people !"
5.0,"I purchased the E-Z Read Jumbo Rain-Gauge and it has been put to use for almost a whole year with no complaints.  I can easily read the gauge, and empty/clean the cylinder out should any debris gets in.  During the winter I simply bring the tube inside and leave the bracket outside without any worries.  I would purchase this product again."
5.0,Fairly accurate and I LOVE that I can see it from inside.
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,"Love this product - getting harder to find these days.  Hopefully when we need another one they will be available.  This particular size, color and setup is the best one out there."
5.0,"Easy to install. I was a little confused when I bought it, because I thought it came with its own post for putting in the ground.  That's not the case. I have a wooden fence in my back yard so I easily screwed the mounting bracket on my fence, and secured the unit. I'm amazed how easy it is to read and empty.  I have it mounted on the fence about 80 feet from my back door, and I can easily see the bright yellow float against the large yellow measurements. I've been amazed that we had 3.25 inches of rain the weekend of Christmas, and right now I'm sitting at almost 4 inches for the New year weekend. I've even hooked up with a local tv station, and send them pictures of the water gauge, and they've used it measurements a couple of times on the news. I know this may sound pitiful or pathetic to some people, but it's one of my favorite things I got for Christmas. That and my inside/outside temperature gauge.  I guess at my age, it's the simple things that bring me enjoyment. That and possibly a new Acura MDX!! .. Oh well, a man can wish, can't he?"
1.0,This is a worthless item.  Its a gage item.
5.0,Very pleased!
5.0,"For Christmas, my mom asked for a replacement rain gauge tube to replace the large print rain gauge she's had on the garden fence since circa 1995. She insisted that the bracket on the fence post was still intact, and she really just needed the tube... somehow the shoddy thing (insert sarcasm here) had dry-rotted and cracked in only 20 years of use. Anyway, I thought there was no chance of finding her a ""replacement tube"" after so long, and I set out to just replace the item with a comparable one. Although I placed the order well into December, I was pleased to receive the product in plenty of time for Christmas (prior to the estimated delivery date). On Christmas Day, mom opened it and exclaimed that it is the exact same model that has been in the garden for so long. It turns out she can put it in the old bracket after all, and save her new bracket for a rainy day. That wasn't intended to be a pun, but I suppose it is. :D"
5.0,Easy to see on deck railing.  Seems accurate.
5.0,works great
5.0,We love it because we can read the numbers from inside our house. The numbers and markings are large enough to read it from the comfort of our home. It is the best style of rain gauge you can buy. The shipping was great too.
5.0,as advertised
1.0,The gauge arrived with missing parts.
5.0,Have had one of these rain gauges for over 10 years.  Out in all weather and still working but the inside has some mold and junk.  Time to buy a new one as have torn down the old porch and put up a new one.  This needs to be cleaned and probably would last another 10 years.  Wife says out with the dirty one and in with a new shinny one.
5.0,This is a great sized rain gauge.  Perfect for my senior citizen eyes to be able to easily read the numbers.  No more squinting to try reading extremely small numbers.
5.0,"All I can say is WOW about this rain gauge.  My husband just put it up today, and we are looking forward to our next rain.  It is large, very easy to read  from a short distance, and just looks awesome.  We really recommend this high quality product."
5.0,"Just as described.  Fast shipping.  Love it, so easy to read!"
5.0,Great product fast shipping
5.0,good product
5.0,It's BIG and easy to read.
5.0,Great to use...we replaced our old one with this.
5.0,Tested accurate and easy to read from a distance.
5.0,"easy to see, great design for measuring small amounts,  great price.  The delivery got interupted by Hurricane Mathew, so we missed a great chance to measure lots of rain here in SC, but we are looking forwrd to using it."
5.0,"Haven't actually use yet, as I bought as a Christmas present, but it looks great!"
5.0,I really like this product. I can see how much rain fell without leaving the house.
5.0,Great for viewing from inside the house!!
5.0,Works well
5.0,Easy to read and nice looking
4.0,"Yes, it's much larger than I expected so you're not going to hide it in the garden, but I know that design makes for a larger collection bowl, hence its more accurate. I did have a problem with water leaking out of the bottom, after a rainy night I went out the next morning just to learn we had not gotten any rain. A little silicon sealer took care of that issue!"
3.0,A bit flimsy but value has yet to be determined as well as durability
5.0,Yes
5.0,I have had this style gauge for over 30 years.  Glad to still find replacements on amazon.  Best rain gauge every.
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,Package was delivered on time. It is easy to mount and read.  So far no leaks at all and works great.
5.0,This is my second one of these.  The first one lasted for years.
5.0,I attached it to our older bracket and left off the one that has to be attached to a board.  It fits perfectly into our family curious of measuring rain.
5.0,"i have had one of these rain gauges for years! They are the most readable around and sturdy.  After about 4 years, you may want to replace it, and always bring it in before freesing"
5.0,Perfect
5.0,It works great and it's big enough to see a long way off.  This is a direct replacement of one I've had for 11 years that finally wore out.
5.0,Easy to read and damn accurate!  Appears durable.  We'll see with this Kansas weather.
5.0,"I love this rain gauge, which is easy to read and mount on a gate or fence.  This is a replacement for the same model of gauge, that lasted for 15 years in the hot and destructive Phoenix Arizona sun.  That says a good deal about the quality of this product."
5.0,"I love this rain gauge, in fact it's the second one we've purchased over the years.  I have no idea why it appears to be a discontinued product."
5.0,This was a gift and it was received with glee!
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Works great and easy to read.
5.0,Very easy to see how much rain you get from a distance. We really like it.
5.0,You can read this rain gauge from a hundred feet away seems to be pretty accurate
4.0,Works great. Easy to read and mount.
5.0,"This rain guage is in it's third year of service for us...which has outlasted any previous plastic, glass, or digital ones we've tried.  Easy to read, the red float is awesome.  We have warm season grass and live in NC, so, I do not leave it out through the winter because my grass goes dormant.  Accurate enough to let me know when I don't need to water.  This season, was growing algae, let hot water and a little sodium percarbonate (aka oxy clean) soak for an hour or so and it looks brand new again.  Whenever this one breaks, will get another just like it."
5.0,"Although I read the description before purchasing this rain gauge, I was surprised at how large it is.  We live in Florida and I like to know how much we get with our frequent summer downpours.  This rain gauge was easy to mount on our fence, and is easy to read from inside the house.  Very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,Husband likes it.
5.0,"I have not put this up yet, but I specifically purchased this one because at my other house I had one of these for many years. Loved it. So easy to read. I just had to have a new one for my new house. Definitely 5 stars."
1.0,"While this is 5/8"" wide, and is a soaker hose, it is flat rather than round, and less than 1/2"" high.  The seller did immediately refund the purchase price when informed of my dissatisfaction with the product."
5.0,"Editing my review:
Set it in the sun for a month and it'll fall apart. Can't even connect a hose to it. If I could change the stars I'd put about 2 stars on this. It's a soaker hose and might work great underground, but in the sun it's worthless."
4.0,"This hose works very well.  It is a little stiff, but I could still bend it around my plants and it gets better with time in the sunshine.  It work really well for soaking at a slow or fast rate depending on how high you turn up the water."
5.0,Feels sturdy even after being in the sun all day.  Real test will be after a year....
3.0,It kinks.  Most hoses seem to.
1.0,very lightweight cheap hose...def not heavy duty.  you get what you pay for.  great price for a 50 ft hose of the extra cheap variety
5.0,Just as described
4.0,good value
2.0,This was a fairly light duty hose that leaked at both ends where the fittings met the hose material. The hose linked easily making it difficult to use.
1.0,Kinks every time I turn the hose on and it leaks.
5.0,Good solid hose!
5.0,Nice hose so far.
4.0,It's big
4.0,Would have given it 5 stars but for the scale being very hard to see. I took my wife's acrylic paint and went over the marks.
5.0,It is a shame that this product is being discontinued.
5.0,the rain gauge was just what it was advertised as.
5.0,Brother in law loves it.  Used it for tropical storm just passing thru here.  Can read from inside house.as it is placed in wide open area far away.
5.0,Great product.  My first one lasted 10 years.  Just bought my second one.
5.0,Great product. Too bad its discontinued. Very easy to read from a distance.
5.0,Just what we were looking for. Looks great on our deck and is easy to read.
5.0,It's perfect I'd like to buy another one if I can.
5.0,Just like the one I am replacing that is about 10 yrs old. The sun has finally faded it and yellowed the plastic. Overall a great rain gage. You get a lot for the price.
5.0,"Buy this and stop wasting money on the cheap plastic junk that breaks after a year of use. This one is a little pricey, but it's well worth the money. Easy to use, easy to assemble, and the large tires make it easy to roll on uneven ground."
5.0,"Great spreader, but the directions are ass backwards.
:)"
5.0,Heavy duty takes awhile to assemble
5.0,"Depending on how old you are, you may recall a time when you could buy things that would last longer than you.  Well if you are looking for that level of quality again, this product may be for you.  With the right level of care, I have no doubt that ours will out last me and my wife.  The manufacturer has carefully used different grades of plastic where it makes sense to use plastic, but the frame, handles, controls and axel are all metal construction.  The wheels are plastic with rubber pneumatic tires.  The pneumatic tires have greater surface area and roll much easier than plastic ones on Earthway's other models or anything made by Scotts in the last twenty years.  Assembly is not for the inexperienced.  The drawings in the assembly documentation are not that good which makes identifying and configuring the parts more difficult.  I took the old mechanic's approach and loosely fit all the pieces together before tightening everything down.  It took a couple of attempts to figure out the exact configuration for all the parts but still I got it up an running in less than thirty minutes.  Hopefully, the manufacturer will improve the drawing or add pictures to their documentation because that really is the only shortcoming I have found with it."
5.0,"The manufacturer failed to open the perforations on the drop plate, one of the screws holding the gearbox together was threaded into the gearbox body rather than where it should have gone and the flange where the spreader control connects was cracked. While that speaks to a lack of quality control these were easy repairs and once sorted the spreader is a massive improvement over any other I have used. The pneumatic tyres roll easily over uneven terrain which has cut time spent fertilizing by half. Well worth the price."
2.0,"Terrible instructions and hard to put together , 2 hours"
5.0,professional grade....if you have over an acre....you need this one
5.0,"I bought this spreader to replace a cheap box store spreader.  Out of the box the spreader was obviously much higher quality than what you get for $50.  I followed the instructions and it took me 1 1/2 hours to put it together.  The instructions aren't the best, but if you take your time and think things through they are good enough to get the job done.  Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.  It was expensive, but I think it will be the last spreader I need to buy.  I would purchase again."
1.0,Did not spread evenly.
5.0,exactly what I needed
5.0,"Just what I was looking for. FAST delivery, too! A+A+A+"
5.0,Great!  Very accurate and readable from a distance.
5.0,It does it's job very well.
5.0,Works great!! easy to read!
5.0,Love the size.
5.0,Easy to Read from a distance. Perfect
5.0,"Yesterday we had our 1st big rain since receiving this gauge & it was so cool to be able to just glance out the back door, w/out even having to open it, to see how much rain we got, especially b/c of the little orange ring in the tube! Such a simple, yet brilliant idea! Didn't have to get wet or muddy to check it, which was AWESOME!! Ordered one for my mother-in-law, too & she'd just put it out before it rained. She called last night, all excited, 1st b/c we REALLY needed the rain & 2nd b/c she was able to simply glance out her kitchen window & see how much rain she'd gotten! Hope they hold up for a long while to come b/c it's just such a neat product!"
5.0,PRETTY ACCURATE
5.0,LOVE IT
5.0,"I've had a half dozen of these over the last 15 years. These are great and given some to friends as gifts. Last fall I took mine down for the winter. You think I could find it this spring? NOT. it is probably stored within 10' of where I thought I put it away. So after an hour of searching, fuming and cussing... I decided to just replace it to save myself a brain hemorrhage. If these are out of production? BUMMER."
1.0,"This hose was a waste of money. Not only is it not kink resistant but its hard to roll up due to the flimsy material. Also, don't drag it over cement, the plastic or vinyl comes off. This is the first hose I ever bought that I really don't like."
5.0,works well
4.0,"My husband bought this hose after giving the soft, nylon no-kink, no-tangle hose a try. It's a hose. Long enough to reach where we need in our small yard and successfully brings water to our grass and plants. It is a little stiff and hard to twist around and use at times. So if you're not as strong in the arms as the average, athletic male this hose may be a bit difficult for you to maneuver."
4.0,"No hose is perfect, but this one is strong enough to at least resist kinking and is not easily damaged by UV sunlight."
5.0,Good lightweight hose for around the home.
3.0,Not as durable as I thought it would be.
5.0,as advertised
5.0,"Good hose...hooked another to it...no problem, seem sturdy..."
1.0,"I had to return this hose and I very seldom return anything.  I attached a spray nozzle to the end and walked away for a couple of minutes and when I came back, the tip of the hose along with the nozzle had come off and the water was just running out.  This was with very low water pressure.  Prior to that happening, I had toyed with returning it because it kinked easily and left an impression on the hose when it did so, resulting in a worsening situation.  I liked the weight and feel of the hose when I first got it, but it was definitely deficient in terms of its functionality."
2.0,"I've used Apex hoses for 15yrs plus, but after having been so disappointed with the Never Kink (always kinks) series. I went with a rubber / vinyl from ACE that I really liked - except until if failed after only 2 seasons by internally leaking between the exterior rubber jacket and the vinyl liner and then morphing into a python before developing several pin hole leaks all on its own within a week. I enjoy landscaping and gardening, so I need good garden hose function of yore (10yrs+ ago before ,more corporation mergers and lesser quality outsourced imports).

So I went back to Apex for this 8509  - which is far from heavy duty in my experience. Hose is surprisingly lightweight and although 5/8"" has never overcome it's shipping slightly collapsed oval shape after hours in the sun and under 80lbs + city water pressure. As other reviews have pointed out - the bib end is nice heavy machined brass, but the service end is lightweight thin brass.

Pros - Lifetime Warranty and good telephone support from Apex.
  Doesn't hang or catch on things as easily as a rubber exterior hose.
  Might be better suited as a reel hose or for someone who would appreciate the lighter weight for maneuvering.

Cons -1) Kinks by just looking at it (or seems to) when pulling it to a new location. I must be very careful to unwind as I pull after being carefully coiled in 4' diameter.
 2) Doesn't flow as much water as my previous 5/8"" 100' rubber vinyl hose."
1.0,"Will not hold water,  leaks"
4.0,I bought this to replace one that I bought about ten years ago. I like these type of rain gauges.
5.0,Love this gauge
5.0,"I had one of these for 20+ years, finally a small crack formed when the water froze and expanded at the bottom, needed another, glad they still make them. Excellent for mounting on a deck railing. I'm very nearsighted and it's easy for me to read from the house, maybe 15' away."
5.0,Great gauge - can read at a distance.
5.0,"Rain levels are important to my husband because of interest in rain at his duck club. So, we have one at home and one 50 miles away at the club. It even stands up to winter temps and we live in an area that gets freezing temp a number of months a year. Just have to be careful it is empty when temp drop cause expansion will break it."
3.0,"works well, but I can't leave out when temps go below freezing, will crack and leak"
5.0,Easy to read and easy to install.
5.0,"I've had one of these rain gauges for years.  In fact, I am on my third one now.  Wouldn't be caught in the rain without it!"
4.0,The numbers on the this gage are really BIG & easy to read.
5.0,Not used yet but seems to be well made.  Instructions for assembly easy to follow.
3.0,I love the big tires.  The issue I have with it is the lever to adjust the flow of material is too weak and bends instead of opening the vents when the hopper is full.  I have to reach under the hopper and open the vents.  Poor design and material in that respect.
3.0,"Ridiculously difficult to assemble. Fix your assembly instructions. I had to backtrack multiple times (take it apart)  to get it assembled properly, after I figured it out on my own. The assembly instructions are poor at best."
5.0,"Easy to assemble.  Manages greater capacity of lawn fertilizer, exactly as advertised.  It's not cheap, as you are getting what you are paying for."
3.0,"Once put together it works just fine. However, putting it together was a whole different story. The instructions lack, and are less than accurate. Once I realized my error it became pretty simple, but the damn thing literally took 4-5 hours of staring at it to figure out. Actual assembly time was like 20 minutes. I will never see this product sitting in my shed without it reminding me just had mad It had me putting it together. Sad thing is, it wasn't complicated, just unclear instructions easily interpreted the wrong way. We live in an age where diy videos prevail. I would highly suggest a 5 minute video be available for assembly."
3.0,"It's okay, but there is only one really good broadcast spreader and this, unfortunately, isn't it."
5.0,Solid and durable. Not a 2yr plastic throw away product
5.0,"Great spreader for the money. The assembly isn't as bad as everyone complained about. Took me about 45 mins. If you can read directions and have some sort of a brain you'll be just fine putting it together. Has a nice spread, and the side spread is a cool feature but I won't use it much. It's easily adjustable under the hopper for the spreading pattern Overall good product so far. When I got it I took the 6 screws out of the gear box and greased the plastic gear up more, but isn't necessary."
5.0,easy to push.  great
5.0,"Now includes SideSpred-Control! I wanted to purchase this spreader a year ago, since it has an adjustable handle and several other great features."
5.0,Easy to assemble - all parts clearly identified and instructions sequence the assembly in a logical order.
5.0,"This Earthway spreader is replacing a very old Republic spreader (~25 years old with hard plastic wheels).  This 2150 spreader, as well as Earthway's customer service, is awesome!  I contacted Earthway for a small issue and they promptly sent out the replacement part needed.  Customer service is courteous and responsive.  Quick shipping for Amazon's partner and Earthway's extraordinary support make this one of the best purchases I have ever made.

As for performance, this spreader is easy and a joy to use (not my general response to yard work).  I actually look forward to the opportunity to use this spreader in the future.  If you are looking for a spreader, this is could be the best purchase you can make.

This spreader is an incredible tool.  It is well made and feature rich.  I absolutely ""love"" the large pneumatic tires for ease of use, and the accuracy of the spreading dry fertilizer.  The Side-Spread-Control is a very useful feature to avoid spreading fertilizer on hard-scape (patio, driveway, sidewalks, etc.)."
5.0,AWESOME PRODUCT.
3.0,I should have took notice of the reviews addressing directions for assembling. They are the most cumbersome directions ever. Earthway missed creating friendly. For the money I expect more metal than plastic. I will give a test this week to see the durably....
5.0,Very good spreader.
5.0,"My original Earthway, which wasn't a commercial model, finally bit the dust after 20 yrs.  When the distribution spinner disc broke at the spindle anchor I was able to fabricate a fix (I liked it THAT well).  But when the setting cable broke away from the distribution plate after a few more years, it was beyond help.  I should have bought this commercial model in the first place.  It would likely have been a lifetime model for residential applications."
4.0,"Well, it does the job. Only the frame is steel. Tires are rubber, but wheels and everything else is plastic. About an hour to put together I guess. Spreads evenly and is easy to walk behind. I did see a tag inside not to use rock salt. That's one of the reason's I bought this. A little disappointed with not being able to use salt and all the plastic. Was expensive to me, but my lawn looks MUCH better now."
1.0,"Was very excited about this spreader I got for Fathers Day.  The Lawn Care Nut on YouTube highly recommended this unit. Was gonna be a Big improvement over my Scott's mini Edgeguard.
Well, after the 2 hour assembly, 1 of the pneumatic tires won't hold air, but I insisted on throwing down my July 4th  Milorganite application. The alleged 50 lb hoppper barely held the 36 lb bag.  Not even enough room for 1 more pound, much less 14 lbs!!  Other issues, no edge guard, lack of precision on the spreader settings, and placement of drop holes to the rear instead of the front where material collects when close to empty.  Needless to say, returning this unit and looking for a better one."
4.0,Heavy duty but confusing spreader setting control.
4.0,"I have just received and assembled this spreader, and have not yet used it.  It appears to be well made and designed.  Assembly did take a while, as you must be very careful in following the instructions.  But if followed carefully, assembly goes smoothly.  I like the larger diameter pneumatic wheels, which should minimize the tendency to tip over when it hits a dip or hole in the yard.  I see no reason why this spreader should not last for many years, decades even, if reasonably maintained."
3.0,"Sent back, all the mounting pieces were not included. Otherwise the item seemed to be as described in the ad"
5.0,Very visual. from my home. Good tool.
4.0,Good quality. Just what I expected from a rain gauge.
5.0,it was just like the one we had for 20 years--just love it
5.0,"We mounted the rain gauge outside our kitchen window and enjoy checking the level after every storm.  It's so easy to read from a distance.  After years of drought, seeing the water level rise is a real treat!"
5.0,I love this rain gauge! It's large enough for me to read from my back door without walking outside to the post that it is mounted to.
3.0,Too big!
5.0,great product
4.0,With these large numbers you can see from a distance and works good for us.
5.0,"great product, exactly what i was looking for, and could not find locally"
5.0,Very  Pleased!!!  Well made.  Follow the assembly directions.
5.0,Just as described
5.0,"I already owned a push type Earthway spreader, it is a nicely made piece of equipment.  I have a large yard that has some slope to it, so fertilizing my bermuda lawn with 2 different products is fairly taxing physically.  Using this new Earthway tow behind spreader is great.  I wish I would have bought this a couple of years ago.  This spreader has the same great build quality and the controls are conveniently located.  The control lever does not feel cheap and flimsy, it is fairly substantial.  I have a couple of places in my yard that have quite an angle to them.  The unit wanted to tip over in these places, but I reached back and placed my hand on the edge of the hopper and made it through fine.  Overall a very nice product."
5.0,EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Tires glide over uneven terrain and the handle is a comfortable length for my back.  No bending over. Much better quality than my green one.  Perfect Earthway.
5.0,This thing does work! Great buy!
5.0,"This Earthway 2150 Commercial Spreader is GREAT! Very sturdy and the large tires roll over roots, twigs and bumps very easy. Also easy to roll on inclines. I put 20-30 lbs at a time. When the material gets towards the end you have to shake it a bit as you walk to keep it flowing but that's not a problem. I noticed that the setting that the weed and feed bag gave for Earthway was 11.5, was not enough, it barely came out. I pushed the handle and closed the opening then reset it at 13 which was better, but I had to walk the area again to use the amount figured for the 10,000 sqft. Next time I'll set it at 14 (trial and error). I washed it really good and sprayed it with Fluid Film. I plan on using it 2-4 times a year. Hope it lasts for years. :)
It took my husband about an hour to put together. He said something about a part number was not marked correctly, that was the only difficult thing."
4.0,"Like most people , I've gone through a few box store spreaders but decided to shell out the money for quality this go around. Expecting this to be my last spreader purchase. Should last my lifetime."
5.0,Would recommend and buy again.  Pushes like a dream.  I have only used once.  Second outing coming up.  Fairly easy to assemble.  Other reviews seemed to have complaints. I just took my time.
5.0,"Works great. Used it all last year, easy to push."
5.0,"After spending money and returning a couple of the ""green"" spreaders, I bought this after watching The Lawn Care Nut on You Tube. This is a commercial spreader all the way. I keep my lawn at 4 inches and the tires have no problem going over it. Buy it and you'll never go back."
4.0,love it and how easy it is to read from a distance. Seem very accurate so far.
5.0,Nice large rain gage. Can see from a good distance.
4.0,Easy to read and certainly as accurate as I need.
5.0,"I replaced one I had for years, best rain gauge ever!"
4.0,"Worked as described.  Easy set up.  Easy to read from a distance (from the porch so that I don't have to get wet reading it!!)
Easy to take down in winter"
4.0,"I ordered this for my dad to replace one that he had previously that broke. He hangs it on his chainlink fence and this one was easy to hang and it really is jumbo. It was a little bigger than I expected, but it still looks nice and is very easy to read. My dad likes it. If it would only rain here then I could tell you how it works."
5.0,This is a great product. We can sit it up and still see how much rain we have received with out having to go out in the rain to read it. Thank you very much.
5.0,"I am entirely satisfied with this purchase.  Granted this is a rather low-tech item, but there is no need for additional improvements that would significantly increase the cost.  The wide-mouth tube with the floating disc can be easily read from a distance away, which is a very helpful.  Thanks for a fine product!"
5.0,Too bad this is being discontinued.  Love the fact that the amount of rain easy to see from a distance.
5.0,"Love this rain gauge, it's easy to read from a distance"
5.0,I've attached this to my back fence and the numbers are large enough I can read it from inside the house!
5.0,Perfect gift for a person who has everything...
5.0,Great rain gauge.  Can see easily from house window.
5.0,bought this to replace old one exactly like it but had finally broken.
5.0,"The best water gauge, easy to see at a distance.  I had the same years ago, it lasted a very long time.  Excellent product."
5.0,"This is our third E-Z Read Jumbo Rain-Gauge. They last for years. It's stationed relatively far from our house in an open area, and it's still easily visible from a rear window. I have often compared our results with rainfall totals reported by the local news and weather outlets -- and the readings from the E-Z Read Jumbo Rain-Gauge are amazingly similar. I say ""amazingly"" because this rain gauge appears to be from Jurassic Park. Who would expect such a large and seemingly simple device to be so reliable? As with other reviewers, I'm disappointed that the product has been discontinued. I suggest that you buy one or more while you can, before stock runs out."
5.0,Can see this perfectly as we drive by.
5.0,This is my second one in many years. The first did not make it through Katrina.
5.0,as advertised. well packed.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift because I've enjoyed mine for years. The large and hi-viz numbers make it so easy to see from a distance.
It's important to note these 2 things: 1. In the summer months, if you don't empty the water for a few days after it rains, plan on having a mosquito nursery spring up, and 2. If it freezes and water's still in there... it's likely to split (I learned that the hard way!)"
5.0,"Using this broadcast spreader cut the time to fertilize my lawn from one hour to 30-minutes.  The large pneumatic tires make pushing with a load easier and the broadcast pattern is much larger than my Scotts spreader, reducing the number of ""passes"" required.  Assembly took some time; but, it was worth it."
4.0,"I have not used the spreader yet.  I have assembled it.  Some people complained about the assembly instructions.  I feel they are about standard for instructions.  They could be improved a lot.  But not a deal breaker.  The parts appear to be strong and should last a long time.  I would like to see them add washers under all the nuts, and to the axle between the wheel and cotter pin.  None were included.  I had to modify the aluminum linkage rod to keep it from binding.  Pleased so far.  I'll update after I use it."
4.0,"Instructions are really a joke. Very poor. For such a nice spreader, this is surprising.
The quality of the unit is excellent.
Would have given 5 stars if they improved the instructions. This must be fixed."
5.0,awesome very smooth.
1.0,"The pre-drilled holes don't line up and/or the shape of the metal framing doesn't align, which made assembly impossible. I made the necessary alterations myself, but there is no reason it should require more than a couple wrenches, a screwdriver and 20 minutes to build a simple broadcast spreader.  Even more aggravating given the ~$200 cost of this spreader."
4.0,"Didnt expect to Totally assemble and took much too time to assemble. Instructions were ok, but not great. Question some designs; why one wheel has cotter pin on inside and outside on the other, why not an ""impeller"" in the hopper instead of just a cotter pin. Overall, pretty satisfied."
5.0,"Like the other reviews, the assembly directions could use a little work. Most said it would take about two hours but I figured I could beat the time since I'm always working on stuff. Nope, it took me about two hours. Surely, they could pay someone a couple of hundred dollars to write up a good set of instructions. Once it was assembled, it worked like a champ.  I love the big tires and it feels solid. It makes quick work of my acre of lawn. I've very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Does the job! Sturdy!
5.0,"Excellent spreader!  Very sturdy feel.  Easy to load, push, clean, adjust drop-hole size, etc.  This thing will probably out-last me!"
5.0,"Replaced 15 year old Earthway.  This new model is more robust and with bigger wheels and more comfortable handles making it easier to push even when fully loaded.  The bucket now has a polished vs rough finish making the particle flow smoother.
But... the assembly and instructions need improvement.  Each part should be labeled as to number when assembling.  Provide more hints.  I missed the distinction between bearings and bushings and had to take off the cotter pin drive wheel twice.  It took me nearly 2 hours with my mistakes.  Remember - the bushing bearing goes in first and the bearing inserts into the bearing both inserted from the outside of the flat part of the frame - then the wheels when cotter pins.  There are also some unpainted parts that should be factory painted.  I intend to paint those with Rustoleum.  There was also a small spacer extra part which was not in list and didn't go anywhere.  hmmm...  Best advice - Rinse off unit after every use and you won't get any rust through and never leave outside.  You should get several decades of use of this very well designed spreader.  Well worth the spend and I've gotten best yard award in my South Carolina subdivision with my all Fescue lawn."
5.0,I love this rain gauge.  I have it about 15 feet away from my kitchen window.  I love looking outside and being able to quickly check the rain fall.  It is easy to empty and easy to install.  Looking forward to rain coming this weekend since we have had a very dry August!
5.0,"This is a great rain gauge, can put it on our deck and read it from inside with no problem.  We are disappointed that the company is not going to make it anymore but very happy you still had one."
4.0,Great gauge. Would have given it 5 stars but it hasn't rained since I put it out.
5.0,Works good and easy to read
5.0,Works great and relatively accurate.
5.0,This is a wonderful rain gauge.  Can be seen from the house without getting wet to read the amount of rain that has fallen.  I have tried to find this exact rain gauge for over a year.  Too bad it has been discontinued.
5.0,Big easy to read.  the last one we had lasted about 8 years.
3.0,I really liked this ideal but to get the true reading on this my husband had to place a larger funnel on top of this rain gauge.
5.0,Very easy to read on the expanded scale.
5.0,Love these rain gauges.  Easy to read.  Ready for some rain here in the Texas hill country now.
5.0,Heavy duty.
5.0,"Holds entire 40lb bag of fertilizer.
Pushes easily enough for its loaded weight.
Spreads very evenly.
Assembly is one hour max."
4.0,This spreader is very well made. It was not hard to put together. Very happy with it.
5.0,Perfect for those spring and fall fertilizing chores.
4.0,"Others have commented on how poor the directions are, and I couldn't agree more. Not only are the drawings too small to show some of the detail but a couple of the directions are simply physically impossible to follow.  So, yeah, allow at least an hour for assembly, and don't buy it if you're not a little bit skilled at such tasks.

One important note:  they leave out the directions to attach a cotter-style pin to the spreader shaft INSIDE the bucket.  If you don't put this in, the spreader will not work properly with salt.

Also note:  the directions explicitly state that the spreader can't be used with salt.  It works fine for me and I have to assume that the problem is that spreader shaft where it penetrates the bucket will eventually rust out."
1.0,Excellent spreader..... follow the assembly directions exactly... takes about 45 minutes ... although i agree it could be written and illustrated a bit better.
2.0,"I *really* want to like this product. It's the first ""real"" broadcast spreader I've owned. But the fact is, this thing seems to clog and sputter way too much. I've tried Milorganite, Scotts, and various other brands of uniformly granulated fertilizers. I've also used this to spread grass seed of varying varieties and sizes. This thing has *never* consistently thrown the product at a steady rate for longer than just a few paces. After those few paces, it slows down or even stops entirely. I then have to close the hopper, shake the bucket, reopen the hopper, and it flows as it should...for a few more paces. When I get really impatient, I just shake the whole contraption while walking (without closing the hopper), and the result is unexpectedly some ""hot spots"" in the case of high nitrogen fertilizer.

I cannot see anything wrong with how I assembled it. The ""agitator"" cotter pin, (in my opinion, it's too small) is, in fact, moving; however, it doesn't do much of a good job to keep the product flowing.

In short, I'm really bummed about spending this much cash on a spreader that doesn't work as well as a lesser-priced drop spreader I have that's green and orange with a brand-name we all know too well. I'll keep using it simply because my drop-spreader would take too long to cover approx the 17,500 sqft of lawn I'm dealing with."
5.0,Worth every penny.  This will last for 10 years if used every day.
5.0,Well built and worth the money. I was short one locking washer and nut and the company next day aired the the ten cent items to me. I was shocked that they would spend $10.00 to ship ten cents worth of product. Super job on customer service... Great quality but may take a few hours to put together...
5.0,"if you aren't mechanically inclined, just  go buy this from a local store pre-assembled.  Why anyone gives this spreader bad reviews for the assembly is beyond me.  Your rating the spreader, not the assembly instructions.  FWIW, it took me about 45min and a few ""i guess this looks right"" moments to get it together.

On to the actual product, it is a great spreader.  Spreads evenly (seed, granuals, etc) and when you move the lever to the closed position, it actually closes completely unlike many of the big box products that rely on a spring to snap the gate shut.  The large wheels are great on uneven or wet lawns and although im not sure of the gear construction (metal or abs) it seems fine..

If i had to improve something, I would funnel the bottom of the hopper more so that you don't have to shake it as much to get the last of the material out, but short of that, this thing is built to last.  You are spreading chemicals, and its made out of metal, so clean it up when your done and it will perform as expected.

Initially i was pretty skeptical at the price, but after dealing with the $50 big box junk, I forgot all about the price once i used it."
5.0,This is a wonderful product. Easily seen from a distance and we'll built.
5.0,Perfect for my old eyes.  Recommended.
5.0,"Yup, measures rain fall, easy to read from a distance."
5.0,Easy to read from the house!!
3.0,"I bought this because of its large size and easy legibility - I can look out my window and easily see how much rain has fallen. It works just fine. My only concern is its durability: the tube itself is a thin and somewhat flexible plastic that it is likely to become brittle with age and easily crack. The other problem is the mounting bracket that holds the tube - it has a very thin, flimsy plastic loop at the top through which one puts the tube. I don't think that loop will last long."
5.0,Love IT!!!
5.0,Great rain gauge! Very easy to install and read.
5.0,Bought this for hubby.  Mounted easily on our deck.  Super easy to see from the patio door.  Recommend this!
5.0,"works great, well worth the cost"
5.0,love it
5.0,"This is my first review... and wanted to dispel any concerns about putting this Earthway 2150 together in less than an hour.  Yes, I read the reviews from numerous individuals that had some difficulties.  My advise is to read the whole instruction, one step at a time, and study the diagrams carefully (perhaps reread the instruction again) and complete only that step.
In most cases the assembly is pretty straight forward.
I did have one time where I needed my dear wife's hand holding the handle shaft in place as I inserted it into the lower handles (kind of needed 3 hands) however I could have used a clamp if necessary.
On the whole, I quite pleased with my purchase and am confident this spreader will outlast me."
2.0,"Don't buy this unless you're a real handyman. Poor instructions. Parts didn't align correctly. I had to drill two new holes to fasten the control support to the lower handles. They were off by about 1"". Unit had been returned probably because of this. A couple of cotter pins had to be straightened. Haven't used yet but looks like it might might work OK. Could use stronger hitch plates."
5.0,"I purchased this spreader after my chinese made model broke after the first season... The assembly took me about a half hour and the quality construction of the unit was very impressive. I am a professional contractor and have found that it pays to spend a little more money when buying tools. The higher quality tools last much longer than the cheaper ""Limited Life"" models that are guaranteed to break. Also the higher quality tools come with increased productivity and less time wasted on the inevitable and time consuming repairs associated with cheaper models. I highly recommend this product and hope that this post helps make lawn care experiences much more enjoyable and productive for future purchasers."
5.0,"Great unit and it is just like the 2170 which has a bigger hopper.  Even though the 2170 has a higher msrp it is on sale now for $30 cheaper.
See my review frmthe 2150."
3.0,Wheels do not fit properly on the axel.  The spinner in the bin is not adequate.  I often shake the spreader to continue spreading.  The tiers loose air.
4.0,Little difficult to put together but a good product.
4.0,"The spreader on its overall merit is very good. I did ~3,000 square feet of my yard in under 20 minutes with 2 bags of milorganite. You gotta haul tail on the medium setting (3.5mph). I knocked one star off for exactly what the other reviewers have already stated...the instructions are terrible. It took me 2 hours to go back and forth between YouTube videos and these instructions to figure out how to get it together. At least three times, I had to undo several bolts because I'd put them in the wrong place or installed in the wrong order. For example, the arm that connects the lever to the hopper hole opener was very difficult to determine the exact orientation for install. I spent 20 minutes just trying to understand the order of the parts that need to go on before you put the wheels on and put the pins in place to hold them in. There are only two videos on YouTube and both apply to slightly different models of Earthway spreaders, but it helps to give you the general idea. The included instructions have no dotted lines to help you follow what connects to what in which order. The videos also show that different models of Earthway will apparently come with more parts too. Like washers. I guess the 2150 requires no washers because I didn't get any."
5.0,"I rarely post a review before i actually use a product, but since there was so many complaints for the assembly instructions i decided to post one early.  Sure the instructions could be a little better, but I don't think they are nearly as bad as some make them out to sound. The only time I had serious issue was when i was trying to figure out how to attach the bar to the tub trap door. Other than that I was able to assemble it relatively easily.  Quality seems really good, and I love how comfortable it is for me to push at my height.  I'm 6'4, and I'm able to push it while standing straight up. This is huge for me when it comes to spreaders, since all my previous ones i had to bend over to push properly."
5.0,This is a really good quality spreader. Big tires make it easy to get over uneven ground. Holds a good amount and spreads evenly. Just what I needed for my large and hilly lot.
4.0,"Just bought one of these, but not through Amazon.

I consider it to be heavy duty and of good quality.

The problem was the assembly.  I made 3 mistakes along the way, each time requiring it to be partially disassembled to fix my error.  That was partly my fault and partly due to the instructions.  What I would highly recommend, though, is for 2 people to assemble it together, or at least have somebody nearby to help at certain points during the assembly.  There are a few steps where it would be extremely helpful for one person to hold multiple pieces together while the other attaches the nuts and bolt(s).  Overall it took me about 2 hours to assemble it.  Having done it once I could probably do another in, say, 20-30 minutes.  I wish there was an already assembled purchase option, for say, an additional $20.  That would require a slight bigger box, though.

I have yet to use the spreader.  One thing I did notice was that there is no instant off of the hopper (to shut off while changing directions) like the cheap Scott's spreaders.  With those Scott's spreaders, you squeeze a lever when you want to close the hopper opening.  Releasing the lever puts you back in feed mode at the rate you initially entered.  With this spreader, you basically have to close the hopper opening by setting the spread rate to zero, then after you finish changing directions, you have to reenter the feed rate for the opening.  That's probably no big deal, but thought I should mention it.

But as I said, it's of nice quality and I should be happy with it."
5.0,My second one of these.
5.0,The E-Z read is senior friendly and more than meets our expectations. It is so easy to read! The grandchildren love watching the floater move during rain storms. Our last E-Z read lasted for 8 years. Very disappointed that this particular gauge is being discontinued and thankful that we were able to replace the tube.
5.0,I can see the letters from my back door to the fence about 30 ft away. Easy to mount and drain too.
5.0,great easy to read even for old folks
5.0,Very easy to see from far away.
5.0,Very accurate
5.0,the best rain gauge ever!
5.0,Product was as described and delivered on time.
5.0,Great
5.0,Very Clever. Well built. You can see the readings without going outside due to the orange float.
5.0,"I love it!  Well made and even wide spread.  Got my yard done in half the time it took with the Scotts ""Pro"" model.  Assembly took a around an hour.  The Earthway website and the instructions have excellent charts to make correct accurate settings.  I read here that some people gave a bad review after spreading rock salt.  The instructions say expressly that rock salt will damage the gear box."
4.0,Good quality
5.0,Great product and sturdy
4.0,"As noted in other reviews, assembly takes a bit of time, but is not complicated."
5.0,Worth every penny!!! Will out last the box store spreader by years!!
4.0,"A good spreader, but overpriced.  Drive appears to be light duty."
5.0,"Just received my Earthway Commercial 50-pound Broadcast Tow Spreader yesterday.  The assembly took 2+ hours.  Have just finished spreading fertilizer on my 32,000 sq.ft. lawn.  The spreader worked well and spread the fertilizer evenly using my John Deere tractor.  So much faster and easier than using a walk behind spreader."
5.0,"Love it. It's sturdy and smooth. Love the big wheels, great for rolling over rough Terane."
5.0,The earthway 2150 is well built and much easier to push that my old scotts easygreen3000.  As others mentioned it takes about an hour to assemble.  The most challenging part is getting the handle to bolt into the u shaped arms that surround the bucket.  I put it together myself but it would have been easier if I had someone squeeze the parts together so the bolts would feed through.  See attached photos for the parts and packaging.
5.0,love it! great improvement from what i had in pass.
2.0,"I expect more out of a spreader when I pay over $150 for it.  The lever to open the holes in the bottom of the spreader doesn't work reliably due to the cheap plastic used.  The plastic bends most of the time before the holes open.  Even when they do open, I can't be sure that they've opened all the way allowing the correct amount of fertilizer to get through.  Would have been much better had they used a sturdier material.  I'd look at other options before buying this again."
2.0,"I purchased this product knowing that assembly was required and not being a guy who was good with tools and that sort of thing. I received the product and got it out of the box and read the instructions several times b/4 beginning the process of assembly. Well, after 2 to 3 attempts of trying to put this thing together, I called Earthway customer service and told them how terrible the instructions were. They referred me to their national sales manager and she gave me his phone number and left him a voice mail. This was on Monday afternoon and I have yet to hear from him. Talking about very poor customer service. I finally after struggling with this thing got it put together. So, a word to the wise if you are not handy mechanically, etc. think twice b/4 purchasing."
4.0,"good unit, this is my second one, better than anything else I've seen out there."
5.0,Had this spreader for 3 years. No issues.
5.0,Works great and the container for the fertilizer is huge.
5.0,It's a great spreader  !!!
3.0,I like the big pheumatic tires.  It rolls easily.  The lever that sets the flow could be better.  I can't often find the setting for the brands of ferltiizer that I buy on the scale.
5.0,love it
5.0,"Very nice and well built. Instructions due suck but if you've ever assembled Ikea furniture it's not a problem, it took me about 30 minuets to assemble"
4.0,"I really like the unit. I am 6'6"" tall, and it's no trouble to push at all. I did use the taller person setting while assembly, which I was happy to see. It pushes --very-- easily over my rough lawn. Works great. I wouldn't call it commercial, but more like serious yard care owner worthy."
5.0,could not believe it. just what i was looking for even fit my old holder.
5.0,Husband Loves it!!
5.0,Big and easy to read!  Love it.
4.0,"It is as stated easy to read, and it fits the decorative holder I had on hand."
5.0,Very big! The kids will love this!
5.0,Just what I have been searching for.
5.0,Love this easy to read rain gauge!
5.0,So easy to look out the window to see the rainfall.
5.0,I love this rain gauge.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted
4.0,"Instructions could be clearer and use better pictures, but all in all this is a great spreader!"
5.0,Nice heavy duty spreader--hopefully won't need another one for many years. Rolls around the yard effortlessly.  Bucket size and balance perfect combination.
5.0,feels like the Cadillac of spreaders
5.0,Replaced an older spreader with this same model again. Hard to believe how much easier the new one is to push!
4.0,"Let me just preface this review by saying the spreader itself is great. It's rugged and sturdy, holds a full 50 pound bag of granular fertilizer with a little room to spare, rolls easily over the lawn, and the solid-link shutoff feature works very well. All that said, the instructions are the worst I've seen come with a consumer assembeled product! I'm an engineer by education and career and am very mechanically inclined- even with all that going for me it took me over an hour and a half to put this together!
The key I learned was to read the instructions thoroughly, all the way through PRIOR to trying to assemble. A number of the steps require you to piece multiple pieces together before tightening the fasteners, so that the whole sub-assembly gets built at once.
I did not pay enough attention to the instructions - and had to go back and take apart the axle unit to install part #32 and #33 (the axle sleeve bearings). This was after I had already bent the wheel securing cotter pins in half.... that was a chore to undo!
Also read carefully when you get to Step #10. If you are short like me, you will want the handle at the lowest position. This means you'll have extra parts that are used. The spacer (PN #14 and one extra hex head screw). This is OK. I was worried I missed another step and had to fix my mistake again.
Earthway, if you read these reviews please consider my recommendations. Break each of the steps out into greater detail after Step #5 - add photos of each of the separate assembly steps, not just one sub-assembly drawing. Putting the multiple pieces together sharing fastners is confusing. The drawings don't show the level of detail needed to fully understand what has to happen, and the text description is worse."
4.0,Works good but doesn't quite hold 50 lbs of fertilizer!
5.0,Great product
5.0,"Have owned this since 2010 and STILL operates as good as the first time I used it.

I owned the piece of shxt Scott's models prior and they ALWAYS fell apart, spring in tension cable would break, difficult to use due to the very small wheels and bucket.  I got SO tired of that brand breaking, I splurged on this.  Lasted 5 years, using approx. 5 times per year, full capacity/

EASY to roll (I have .40 acre lot with hills, slopes and flat areas), easy to fill and adjust, etc.  LARGE bucket = less refills means less work with a very large yard.
Not one regret with the buy!  Will probably last another 5+ years."
1.0,What a waste of MONEY a $60 one a Wal-Mart will do the same thing. the only thing its got going for it is the tries.the barrel won't let the fertilizer completely drain the butter fly adjustment screw is plastic witch is cheap and all ready broke the 5th time I used it and boy boy it will spill the fertilizer out in a heart beat if you are not careful I can go on and on but I won't but I did try to warn you
4.0,"Assembly 45 mins, pay close attention to the insructions, not all that clear.  Nice spreader though.  Very heavy duty, gearbox is much beefier than the lower model I owner previously which only lasted 2 years."
5.0,Just what I was looking for ....
5.0,Outstanding
5.0,Easy to read from a distance
5.0,Very nice ran gauge. Easy to read.
5.0,nothing better for us old sight impaired senior citizens to see just how much it rained last night!~
5.0,Bought this to replace an identical one that had lasted over 15 years.  Love this model because it can easily be read at a distance.
5.0,These are just great.  We can hang on the fence on the far side of our backyard and easily read amount of rainfall from inside the house.  Good buy at good price.
5.0,The is my second one.... wore out the first one!
5.0,"While some people might find this gauge a bit gaudy, I love it.  This is the second of this style that I have had - the first one lasted more than 10 years.  I can easily see how much rain is in the gauge while standing inside the house.  I do sometimes wish that it held more than 5"", as we have storm systems that dump more than that amount, but for the most part it is just fine.  I was unable to find it in my local hardware store, but found it easily on Amazon."
5.0,"Love our rain-guage. Attached this easy to read product to a nearby fence post. We check it every time in rains. It has an orange color floaty that travels upward as the unit fills up with rain giving a visual readout. Has 1/4inch calibration marks with 1/2 inch and 1 inch larger indicators for easy read. Simply lift off the mount, turn over to drain, place back on mount and your back in business. Works great."
4.0,When I received these clippers I noticed that the bottom jaw was not lined up with the top jaw. The bottom jaw had a groove  in it's middle where the top blade was supposed to hit; as a result they did not cut well.  I put the bottom jaw in a vice and bent it to mesh with the top blade and it worked well. This was probably an infrequent mistake but if a person didn't have a vice to fix them with they would have been returned.
5.0,As advertised. A+++++  detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
2.0,"I have a very small garden. These were used to trim back roses.

They work(ed) well, however, after just one season's use they need significant sharpening. This is so even though they were only used to cute green growth."
2.0,"I bought a Snap-Cut 19T anvil pruner a long time ago; it worked perfectly for many years until the grip pads started slipping off the metal.  I've since bought two replacements, and have been disappointed in both.

The anvil pruner works by forcing a blunt cutting edge into a grooved surface.  If the two parts became misaligned, the cutter doesn't hit the groove, and the pruner becomes worthless.  The first replacement went bad after a year, and the second one is now going bad after only seven months.  If I twist the blades with my fingers to force them back into place, the pruner will work for a while, but before long it becomes misaligned again.

There's no excuse for a product to go bad so quickly, particularly when I use it only occasionally.  My original 19T pruner -- the one that lasted almost forever -- was made by Snap-Cut in the USA, but the later ones are listed as ""Gilmour Snap-Cut""; perhaps Gilmour acquired Snap-Cut and shipped manufacturing to China.

These pruners work fine out of the package, but their poor durability makes them unacceptable.  I'm now trying a Black & Decker anvil pruner (also made in China) to see if that holds up better."
5.0,"Wow, is this nice. Assembly is a breeze. Anyone complaining about it must not have the right tools or simple mechanical skills. Took about 20-30 minutes to put it together. It works very good. I have had other spreaders and they just seem wear out after a season. Using this with Scotts and Milorganite and my yard looks amazing."
5.0,This has to be the best fertilizer spreader that I have ever used.  I was somewhat dreading putting this together after reading some reviews that said the instructions were lacking but it actually went very smooth.  I am so glad that I spent the money on this.  Hopefully this will be as reliable as others say it is and I can stop dropping $80 every other year on those cheaply made green plastic spreaders.
5.0,"I echo the majority of comments already posted by others: Great product, but TERRIBLE assembly instructions (at least that was the case when I purchased my spreader in August of 2014)."
4.0,This is what I wanted but was a little challenging to put together.
1.0,"If you are looking for a professional and accurate spreader for seed or fertilizer this is not it. Cheaply made (thin metal frame) and requires constant adjustment because the cheap rods that open and close the hopper door bend very easily. I was hoping to save some money and purchased this. All I did was waste 200 bucks.

I have used Lesco and Scotts professional rotary spreaders in the past and this is not even close.

On a positive note, the tires are nice."
5.0,"Very high quality. Took about one hour to assemble with basic hand tools. If you follow the instructions EXACTLY, it is not a difficult assembly.
I am 6'3"" tall and this spreader is perfect for taller people. The large wheels and wider stance make it very stable. My previous Earthway spreader was not comfortable with its' shorter handle and smaller wheels."
5.0,Worked great.  Easy to assemble
4.0,Heavy duty with a nice calibration.  We used it for salt applications but you must wash the unit off to keep it flowing.
1.0,"The spreader arrived in a wet box. The box had been sloppily taped closed. We could not tell if all the parts were present. The manual definitely was not included. The product or parts of the product are too heavy for the box used. Parts should be firmly secured in a stronger box.

By using a manual found online we were able to assemble the spreader. The instructions were poor and incomplete and the directions conflicted with the illustrations. I was surprised that this product was made in Indiana. The English used in the instructions was very poor and did not make sense. American made products should be better than this, I am embarassed.
A hint for the Earthway company: packaging and technical writing are both professions practiced by Americans, please hire the skills you need to complete your product."
5.0,Just got tired of replacing my cheap $40 box store Scott's spreader every year cause the cheap plastic wheels or axle would break. Bought this Earthway 2150 and have now had it a full year. Still performs like new with Zero signs of damage or quality drop off. The large rubber wheels and wide track make using this Earthway on hills or an uneven yards simple. The cheap Scott's would tip over when half full of fertilizer on uneven lawns because of the cheap small plastic wheels and terrible center of gravity. Go ahead and spend the extra money now and have a product that will last a lifetime instead of some cheap garbage that costs more in the long run and has to be replaced every season.
5.0,"I bought this to replace the same one I had before. The first one lasted 17 years. When it gets dirty or algae is growing on the inside (once a year, when you put it outdoors, A dish brush taped to a wire coat hanger cleans it right up.
  AND EVEN MY  MOTHER CAN READ IT FROM 15-20 FEET!"
5.0,"this is a great rain gauge for someone who wants to be able to read how much rain they have at a distance.
we have ours on our fence which is about 48ft from our back door (yes I measured it). highly recommend"
5.0,This is very easy to read. Works great.
5.0,it was exactly what I wanted! Large enough lettering to see from my window to the backyard
5.0,Collects rain well and is easy to observe at a distance. Take in if there is a chance of freezing.
5.0,great
5.0,I've had another similar gauge for a long time.  This one works equally well and readable from a long distance.
5.0,Best rain gauge ever! B& L Industries Should Continue To Make These Wonderful Gauges.
5.0,"Boy! This is the jumbo size for a rain gauge. Nice design and easy to use. We'll see how well the plastic holds up to the summer sun.  It is large, that is for sure."
5.0,good product easily read from inside the house
5.0,Great product but difficult to put together.
1.0,"I cannot comment on the spreader itself, however, I just finished assembling it and am still boiling.  I have never seen such asinine directions that
are incomplete and confusing.  The schematics actually contradict the directions.  I will never purchase anything produced by ""EarthWay""."
5.0,"I have had several cheap spreaders over the years, and they all have been frustrating to use. The most common problems I've had with previous spreaders is that the drive wheel frequently stops driving, and the small wheels make it a difficult task to roll the spreader over uneven ground.

This spreader, however, does not have either of the problems and it's actually fun to use. The large pnumatic tires are a huge improvement.

This spreader is capable of putting down a huge amount of fertilizer or seed in a very short amount of time. This is good but you need to be careful not to have your setting too high. Also, if you are using small granulated fertilizer and have the opening set a little high, it will continue to come out when you stop. So be sure to close the lever a few feet before you come to a stop. Once I got the hang of it, I was able to cover my entire lawn very quickly and I'm confident that coverage is even and good.

Assembly is a little challenging but to me it wasn't really that bad. It took a little over an hour and if I had it to do again I think I could do it in 45 minutes or less. Use a socket/ratchet and wrench. And some pliers for the cotter pins.

I expect this spreader to last for a long time. The only real negative I see is that it is a fairly large unit and it doesn't fold up. So you need to have somewhere to store it."
5.0,"built very well,"
5.0,I use it for a sidewalk salter and it has out performed units that cost twice as much! Very nice product.
3.0,"Way over priced. It works fine, but I don't think it is worth $185 + tax."
5.0,"This spreader makes the work of spreading lawn products much easier. It rolls very well and seems to get an even distribution,"
1.0,"I used this for about 2 hours with Rock Salt, worked great. Tried using it the next day and the propeller will not spin, may need some washing or clean out for some reason, I thought for $200 I would not have to deal with this, I am trying to use this for commercial properties after snow events. It was not snowing or raining when I used it, I always keep it in a heated shop, and empty. Gears froze up for some reason. I just use a shovel now and throw the salt everywhere if My sander breaks, or for walkways."
5.0,Quality product
5.0,"Total quality. The key is the metal rod that runs the open/close selector. Many cheaper models use a cable that flexes and either breaks or changes the desired setting because of the flex. This rod is sturdy and will never flex, always keeping the proper setting on the spreader. Of course, those tires will take any terrain your yard can through at it. It will hold one full bag of Milorganite. I love mine!"
5.0,Our second one. Love the improvements like the red floating level which makes it easier to read the amount of rain.
5.0,"This is my second one in 25 years.  It is very readable and can be placed just about anywhere.  I'm sorry to hear they are being discontinued.  If more people knew their value, it would be a popular product.  Very long lasting (over 25 years and still working for the one I have) and a great price."
5.0,This is the second one we bought.  First one lasted a long long time.
5.0,WORKS GREAT
5.0,does what it is intended to
5.0,:)
5.0,Works well and easy to see.
5.0,Huge. Easy to install and very easy to read.
3.0,This rain guage is bright and easy to read. It came with hardware but it did not have a way to mount it into the ground. I have been professionaly trained as a weather Technitian and the gauge should be mounted in an open area with no restrictions within 25 feet. So the problem with this is you must have a way to mount it. That means a post or a spike in the ground. I had to build a mount with a steel rod to push it into the ground. This is no problem for me but most People do not have my knowledge and tool shop to manufacture a mount....
5.0,"Easy to read, but since putting it up, we haven't had much rain in Texas. Maybe I should take it down and just guess how much rain we are or aren't getting."
5.0,Great gauge.  I've had one for ten years or so and had to replace it.
5.0,Had one just like it for over 10 years.. it works great.. very easy to read from a distance.
4.0,These gauges are the best.  We use them in our backyard and they are remarkably close to the TV weatherman's reports!!!!  The only thing that you should watch out for is to be clear of buildings and trees.  Otherwise it's fun.....also take in when the temp. goes below freezing.  It will last longer and not be exposed to freezing water inside the plastic cylinder.
4.0,Excellent product that's easy to read from a distance.
5.0,Best rain gauge ever -- we have two.
5.0,"I purchased this item September 2, and we finally got some rain here in (Dallas) Texas over a month later - a whopping 3/4""! So I finally got to see this rain gauge in action and am able to write this review. It works great. It's simple with no moving parts. I've tried other gauges (the wireless kind) with zero luck, and I finally decided: simple is best in this case. This gauge measures up to 5"" of total rainfall, and the large, yellow numbers can easily be read from a distance of 30 feet or more. It has a red, plastic float disc that rises as rainwater collects in the gauge. The scale is graduated in 1/4"" increments such that 1"" of rainfall corresponds to about 3"" on the gauge, so it's also easy to read rainfall in 1/4"" increments. All in all, I'm very happy with it. It's a great value for the money, and like they say, ""It just works."""
5.0,A great rain gauge.  We had one that lasted for years.  You can read it from a distance.  A great price and a simple reliable design.
3.0,"I ordered this gauge this past March.  It worked well at first.  But now the red floater no longer floats.  I can no longer simply look out out patio window to see how much rain we got; I must walk up to it.  It seems top me that the floater should last longer than 6 months.  After all, it just floats."
5.0,"It was a relief to find this one. My mother is 86 years old and has had a couple of this type of rain gauge.  I tried several others that were not to her liking.  To small, to clear, to yayaya.  Thanks B&L Industries"
5.0,Easy to read from a distance and easy to maintain.
2.0,"well built, but poorly designed.  with the bottom of the hopper being somewhat flat, the fertilizer, or other material won't flow to the bottom, so you have to stop & shake the hopper/spreader.  also, very inaccurate settings.  i wouldn't recommend."
4.0,Good spreader. For the money should have a guard . Also the setting doesn't seem that accurate . The instructions  leave a lot to be desired .
1.0,"Terrible product, parts missing and broadcaster rubs on hopper."
5.0,"I really debated on weather to get a cheap model at local Home Depot or one like this that should last for years to come. At first I opted for cheap version from HD, but it broke on first use (have a 1/2 acre) and realized this was the way to go. Have had this for two planting/feeding seasons and it is awesome. Would highly recommend. Be sure to print out conversion chart to know how much seed/fertilizer to use for various brands. That is the only tricky part."
5.0,"Product is exceptional and easy to use.  Would be helpful to have a better table for spreading settings for various products (grass seeds, fertilizer, etc.).  Was bale to put together easily by following directions.  Good spreader for the money and should last many years."
5.0,"Works great , well made"
5.0,Great for the price!!!
2.0,Incredibly difficult to assemble.
4.0,great product.  Look for literature on web for proper settings if needed.  Keep moving steadily and realize that you will have spilling if you stop or slow down dramatically
3.0,"As others have stated, this thing is a huge nuisance to put together. The directions are not clear and the pictures ambiguous. The last step with the control rod, use two nuts on either side of assembly. I missed this somehow, and thinking I was in the home stretch, couldn't get the shut off/ dispersement area to open and close properly. I think the company should supply this mostly assembled, instead of burdening its customers. At the very least, include an easy-to-follow guide for the assembly.  I plan on writing this company to suggest this.

Three stars because of the directions and assembly.  The product itself seems to be visually good. I will report back when I actually use the item."
5.0,they work well
5.0,"These are great pruners if you want a sharp anvil style. The 19T is a little larger than the 18T so if you're buying for someone with smaller hands, get the 18T"
5.0,Seems very sturdy and should hold up well
5.0,My favorite garden tool
4.0,Great tool....my wife's favorite.
4.0,ARRIVED ON TIME AND  VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRUNERS
4.0,Bought these and Craftsman anvil pruners at the same time. Gilmour is lighter weight and makes sharper cuts but limited to smaller(quarter inch or less cutting. Blade seems to be dulling more rapidly than Craftsman but easy to sharpen.  The availability of replacement anvil is a huge plus.
5.0,"Second pair ...my forst got lost after 18 years of use. , love my snap cuts"
1.0,"I bought 2 pair of these. When I did a search on Amazon for pruning shears one choice that came up was ""made in the USA"" That is the link I went to and these were there. They are stamped ""China""! They are total junk. The cutter and anvil do not line up and you can't get them lined up. I just threw one pair of mine away and I suspect the other pair is close behind. Save your money and the aggravation!"
5.0,My mom had one of these and lost it. She has been looking for this tool for a long time. I gave it to her as a present and she's been thanking me everyday since. The anvil plate makes cutting her trees a breeze. Would definitely recommend this tool for anyone.
5.0,I've been thru too many of the fertilizer spreaders available at the big box junk stores. They never last! The BIG pneumatic tires and sturdy construction of the Earthway Spreader should make this the last broadcast spreader I'll ever need.
5.0,There were a lot of comments about how difficult this item is to put together.  I'm not very handy but didn't have a difficult time at all.  I've used the Earthway a couple of times and it is so much better than the generic it replaced.  The adjustable handle position allows me to walk normally not hunched over like I was with my old model.
5.0,Easy to put together. Quality materials. Spreads even. Easy to push.  It is worth the money.
5.0,awesome spreader
3.0,"This broadcast spreader works well - quite well, in fact - if you can get the valve to open at the bottom of the hopper.  The shaft which controls the valve is made of thin metal and bends if there is the slightest resistance at the valve (from debris wedged under the plastic gate for example).  Very frustrating to operate, many interruptions to get the fertilizer or pelletized lime to flow.  I had high hopes for this spreader compared to the cheapened Scott's, but cannot recommend it.  I plan to call Earthway to see if there is a retrofit for improved flow control. My bottom line is that I should not have to deal with this problem in a ""commercial"" spreader that costs north of $150.

UPDATE: I have called Earthway Customer Service, who said that they have not heard of this problem before.  They referred me to a field rep who was very helpful. I was advised that the problem may be improper assembly or ""calibration"", which I will verify after receiving the instruction sheet.  The rep stated that pellet lime is very dense and places pressure on the flow assembly.  It was recommended that I spray silicone or graphite on the valve plates, suggesting that this may be a problem area.  Also was corrected that the rod from the control lever is stainless steel - regardless, it bends in a heartbeat.

FOLLOWUP NOTE (September 2014).  A little redneck engineering did the trick.  The Earthway field representative never sent me the instructions to ""calibrate"" this spreader and loosen the mounting bolts on the shutoff plate.  It is just as well since neither of those issues is the basis of the problem I have experienced with a stuck operator lever.  The primary problem is related to the design of the levers on this spreader.  The long control rod attached to the lever assembly is connected to a bell crank (called a pivot and bracket assembly) at the base of the handle.  This pivot assembly changes the pull of the control rod to a push of the pivot rod that connects to the shutoff plate at the bottom of the hopper.  The pivot rod is not horizontal, but slopes down.  If there is resistance at the shutoff plate, the pivot rod tends to exert a downward rather than horizontal force, which increases the bind and causes the control rod to bend.  This bind can be worst at the valve closed position because of the ""7 o'clock"" location of the tab on the shutoff plate.  I attached a bungee cord to prevent the pivot rod from pushing down during operation and have used this spreader without a hitch to spread fertilizer and pelletized lime.  Periodic use of silicone lubricant can also help.  I am certain that the Earthway engineers will disagree with my analysis/fix for the levers, but that is my story and I am sticking to it.  And I am staying with my 3 Star rating."
4.0,Assembly is a nightmare but the spreader works really well. It is probably a little overkill on my small yard and I think this machine is mainly used by landscaping professionals that will use it daily but it works well and i like the fact that I can pour in a 50lb bag without having to refill the machine.
5.0,What a machine!  It can hold a lot of product and the large diameter wheels make it so easy to push with a full load.  It also throws very far and gets the job completed in about half the time as my old Scotts Pro spreader.  Its also very well made and seems like it will last for a long time.
5.0,"Well built.  I have rented one of these (same model) from my local garden supply store for several years.  It is a great spreader.  Packaging the item came in was poorly taped and the bow was just about to come open.  Inside the Amazon box was the manufactures box.  There was no padding inside either box so parts had jostled around a bit, some parts got scuffed up, but everything was there.  Assembly instructions were adequate but could have been better.  Tools needed to assemble include a Phillips screwdriver, 7/16 wrench and socket w/wratchet, and a pair of pliers.  Assembly time was about 45 minutes."
4.0,"Arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was easy to assemble, maybe 30 minutes. I've used it only once and seemed to do a decent job. I purchased this unit to replace a 1 yr old unit purchased from a big box store that was unfortunately (for me) complete junk! I am hoping that the reputation for being American made and long-lived will be evident with this product for many years to come!"
4.0,I have to say the assembly of this product is really difficult on steps 1 through 6.  Giving 4 of 5 stars because of this.  This will definitely outlast my pervious home improvement store $90 previous purchase by 5x.  No question this is a solid piece of equipment.
3.0,"As advertised... Had one before...tube was dented pretty
bad but no cracks...and I suppose still fairly accurate...
Keeping it...let it rain....would recommend... Easy to see."
5.0,"We can see the rain amount easily from inside the house.  Very sturdy with the holder staying in place even in high winds.
Nice float, easy to see.  This is our second one.  We had one that lasted 14 years.  Plan on having this one longer."
5.0,The  1990-12 E-Z Read Rain Gauge is very easy to read from inside the house. It is replacing a similar one we had for many many years. The plastic tube that holds the water began to discolor in our hot Florida sun. Was happy to find this Easy Read Gauge. Highly recommend it.
5.0,Well made
5.0,"This is my third one. The first one died of old age after 7 years in Nebraska, and our last one was destroyed by baseball-size hail. I love it because I can see the large numbers from inside the house, about 20 yards away from the fence where this hangs."
5.0,Just what we were looking for-perfect.
5.0,Exactly as I expected
4.0,I was pleased with this product and delivery.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,"I love this rain gauge. It can be read from inside the house, yards away. I had one of these years ago and could not find another when I needed to replace it. When my last gauge failed, I was pleased to find this one available on Amazon."
5.0,I used to hate spreading weed and feed with a cheep plastic spreader I got at Lowes. What a world of difference. This spreader is much easier and smoother to operate.
5.0,Best spreader I've ever owned. This is a heavy duty unit.  I'm very impressed! I expect this to last the rest of my life.
5.0,"After years of using a Scott's Speedy Green spreader that I had to slouch over to use, this spreader is a welcome relief with the adjustable handle.  Not to mention the time it saves me because it throws a lot wider swath of material than my old spreader.

Had a couple of small bumps putting it together, but nothing I would call major or difficult to overcome.  It's solidly built (made in America) and the big tires roll great across my lawn.  Couldn't ask for anything better in a spreader.

Highly Recommended!"
5.0,"I've not had the chance to use yet but will in a few weeks with an update.  I decided on this spreader after having gone through several ""green"" brand spreaders.  After assembly, this spreader seems to easily outrank the ""green"" ones.  I was a little worried about assembly after reading several reviews, but it's not near as bad as some say.  My four year old and I did it in less than an hour.  The directions were very specific and clear to me."
5.0,"Works Great, However there was no assembly instructions included.  How to go to the web site to download. Easy assembly after getting the instructions."
4.0,"Everything you read about the instruction manual for assembling this spreader is true.  It is often very confusing.  Unless you're a mechanical wizard, count on two hours plus for assembly.  Now that I've put it together, I'm going to move on to something simpler, like winning the Nobel Peace Prize.  Having said that, it is made of good materials, has an adjustable length handle for varying height operators, and looks like it should last a long time so, once you're done, I think you'll have a good product.  And, I'm glad to buy American!  Wish the instruction manual read like it was written by one.  (Tip: for completing step 13 in the assembly instructions, the picture labeled Fig 1,which is not shown with step 13, but shown on the page titled ""Broadcast Setting Matrix,"" was very helpful for me.  I don't think I could have completed step 13 without it.  Glad I stumbled on it.  Good luck!)"
5.0,"I've used professional spreaders for years as a golf course superintendent, and I can say this is the perfect spreader for the homeowner. I purchased this spreader for my own personnel use at home since I could not justify buying a $400 or $500 true commercial spreader given that I would only be using it three times per year. This is, however, not a real professional spreader. A true commercial spreader will have a stronger frame made from aluminium or stainless steel like the Earthway 2170."
5.0,"Nothing not to love.  I'm tall and most spreaders have a short handle.  Not this one.  Adjustable and plenty long.

** Update ** After two summers of use, I really love using this spreader.  As a tall person, the handle is wonderful.  I like this product so much, I ordered a second one for our weekend place.  Google before you purchase.  Unlike my first purchase, I had to buy some place else because Amazon was not even close to being the low price leader I am used to them being.  Great spreader!"
5.0,My husband like this brand best was happy too receive it.a little time too put together. but good product easy to use
5.0,"I bought this last year to replace my old Scott's spreader after a wheel fell off of it. This one is so much better than my old one. The big tires make it much easier to push than my old one, especially on my sloping back yard. The handle is also long enough that I don't have to bend over as much as I did with the Scott's (I'm 6'3""). I've owned a number of spreaders and this is easily the best one I've owned. It's expensive, but it was worth it to me and with it's sound construction, it will probably be the last one I'll need to buy."
5.0,Arrived quickly and just what I wanted!
5.0,This is a replacement for a similar one that I have had for years. I'm sure it will last and last just like the old one.
5.0,"I have had several of these rain gauges over the years  they last, typically, 6 to 8 years before needing replacement.  (I leave them out on my deck 12 mos each year.)  (I should clarify that 6 to 8 year life:  I live in the mountains at an altitude of 8300 feet and the sun's UV radiation is very hard on all finishes and plastic materials.)

This most recent purchase was through Amazon/B&L Industries and delivery was delayed because of a fluke in the way the delivery service interpreted my address.  Amazon and B&L Industries got right on it, and a second shipment arrived in perfect condition.

Thank You, B&L Industries and Amazon!

For anyone wanting a good, accurate rain gauge that can be read easily from several feet away, and has a capacity of several inches of rain, I recommend this product as a winner."
5.0,Works great. Replaced old one I had for Ten years.
5.0,Well made. Easy to mount. Easy to read at a distance. The float doesn't fall out when the water is dumped out. Highly recommended.
5.0,I didn't realize it was so big!!
5.0,We had one like this for years until our Texas sun fried it.  I was so happy to find another one!  I can read this gauge all the way on our back fence!
5.0,Put this on fence where we can read out kitchen window. Works great. easy to read. easy to empty
5.0,"It was so easy to install, and very easy to read after a rainfall.  The value is well worth the cost"
5.0,The rain gauge is larger than I expected but I'm very pleased with it. It is very easy to read from my patio door.
5.0,Does it's job as designed - as seen from photo the 1 inch marks are perhaps a tad over 2 inches apart and large.  This allows amount of rain to be read from a distance.  Ken H>
5.0,"If you want a quick way to see how much rain fell, this Jumbo Rain Gauge is the one.  It is easy to read from inside the house."
5.0,This is the third raib gauge like this one we have had.  Easy to read and works extra good for us
5.0,So great to be able to see the accumulated rain fall from the house or porch even while it is still raining.
4.0,"This was on my wish list due to positive reviews on it.  It was sent as a gift and my friend spent almost 20 dollars and shipping on it. But the mounting brackets were missing and the plastic tube was bent so it could not be mointed.  The company had me return the one with the missing parts and sent a replacement.
Update:  It has held up well for a couple of years.  I store it over the winter since it is designed for rain and not snow :)  and it gives accurate measurements from spring through fall."
1.0,"Our neighbor's gauge always seems to be within .1"" of the majority of readings in our neighborhood.  Our old gauge read WAY too high compared to hers, and now this gauge is 25% less than her readings. I might be skeptical if not for a recent rain when our backyard flooded, and we were sure the gauge would be full...it wasn't, not even close."
1.0,"Works but look around you can find it a lot cheaper.....home centers, discount store..big ""W""!. But, it does work, so just do homework"
5.0,My e-z read rain guage is great very easy to read and well built i would recommend this to a friend.
5.0,This gauge is perfect for getting a fairly accurate tally of rainfall and it is easy to read from a distance.  I have mine mounted to the side of a fence with the top just above the fence top.  I can read it from my kitchen window 20 feet away without a problem.  It is not NOAA accurate but it is just fine for the average person.
5.0,This is an easy to read from a distance rain gauge with nice large numbers.  I like the two screw mounting bracket and the easy removal for dumping after a rain event!  And the large funnel at the top comes off easily for cleaning.  This is my 2nd purchase of this item.  Do remember to take it inside during freezing weather!  Otherwise it can crack if partially filled with water!
5.0,Works great. It looks like it should hold up for several seasons. the other brands i had which were less expensive only lasted 1 or 2 seasons. after one season so far so good
3.0,"The Shaft that operates the opening has come loose and even popped out when using, but goes in easily.  Not sure if I would recommend this to any friends."
5.0,This is a very nice spreader....Follow directions to the letter for assembly and it takes about an hour to assemble.
5.0,"Assembly required, directions a little vague ( it took a solid hour ). But once built, its study and big. Large pneumatic wheels great  for uneven terrain and it glides when in use!"
4.0,I worked for a lawn care company as a chem. applicator for a few years and I got pretty spoiled with the high dollar equipment. This spreader will sling fertilizer and seed with the best of them. If you don't want to spend $400 on the best by this one. The only downfall is the rod from the on/off handle to the adjustment point at the bottom of the handle will bend if you push to hard when shutting off the hopper.
5.0,"Bought this to replace my 10 yr old Republic spreader that finally rusted out on the lower frame that supports the axle.  Like other have said this is a quality product.  Much better than you can find now at any of the local home improvement or hardware stores.  The frame is also heavier metal and a much sturdier feel when pushing.  Like the adjustable height. I originally set it to the highest where my old one was set.  That high setting was much too high for me. I am 5'10"" and ended changing to the middle setting which is still a little on the high side. Not the best assembly instructions but not the worse I have seen either. Took me about 1 1/2 hr but I was sitting in the living room watching TV while I did it. This includes the time I spent redoing the handle height which required going back a few steps.
Rolls smoothing over our 1.5 acre lawn of St Augustine grass with some slopes and exposed tree roots.  The Lesco fertilizer I used even had a setting on the bag for Earthway spreaders.  Double checked it against the calculation chart that came with the spreader and the numbers matched.
Price is a little steep and has gone up $11 since I purchased in September 2013. Also at the time Amazon was offering a $50 gift card for signing up for a Amazon Visa Reward credit card.  I applied during checkout and the $50 came right off the price on my order so I ended up only pay $118 for my spreader."
4.0,"It's a quality product, worth the price but the assembly is somewhat time consuming.  Using proper tools it's still around 45 minutes to get it together.  I'm 6'3"" and experimenting with handle placement to get the right ""feel"" took a little extra time.

I've used the spreader on approx 13 lawns approx 1/2 acre in size.  It rolls extremely well even on uneven terrain.  I feel for the price it's a good investment that if properly cared for, should supply years of use."
5.0,I have now used this on 4 applications and find that it is everything that is depicted.  Have not noticed any missed spots using this spreader although I make sure that it does not run too low on material.  The adjustment on the handle is a real boon as it can be adjusted for tall people.  I highly recommend this spreader.
3.0,"wasn't real happy with it, for the price it didn't perform like I thought it should. It is very comfortable to push. But could get it to spread right at the right setting. I couldn't get the setting amount to lock in. For my height it pushes very comfortably. I am 6'4"", usually I have to bend over quite a bit to push any walk behind spreader. After a while the back gets stiff."
4.0,"I have had this spreader for several months and it replaced a small Scotts spreader.  This is a much more substantial unit and the large tires make spreading over uneven ground easy.  Depending on the product being spread, the spreader may not hold 50 lbs. as advertised.  For example it will only hold 40 lbs. of Plant Tone.  As noted in other reviews the assembly instructions were not very clear and it took me two attempts to get it right.  Therefore I have rated it a 4 star."
5.0,"Search no farther -- this is the hose for you! Never before have I had as much fun with a hose as I had with the Gilmour 1058100 5/8"" x 100' Flexogen Hose. It is flexible enough to make it through tight fitting areas and long enough to reach any spot on the lawn. When I think of heaven, I think of Flexogen!"
5.0,"Well, this hose will be the last one you buy unless the guy who hooked it up to a power washer claims that a tile from your roof fell and snapped it in two! (It can handle 500 PSI, so who knows what those guys were doing! I know they power washed our roof and also destroyed half my plants...I was not happy let me tell you!)

Well, I had just purchased it a few months ago and it didn't get tied in knots. That is pretty normal with those fifteen dollar hoses you can find just about anywhere. Well, they are just annoying! So, after buying a cheap one and knowing better, I ordered this one again.

I am again a happy gardener. Yes, even in winter you need a garden hose. It has a nice all weather construction, special foamed inner layers and a glossy sealed cover. What I really like about this hose is the Flow Guard Plus collar. When the hose is fully extended, normal hoses will kink at the faucet as you yank on them to get over to that last flower bed. Well, this one will not kink since it has a nice collar on it.

Definately a good investment. Just don't let anyone borrow it!

~The Rebecca Review"
5.0,"I'm an air conditioning technician, so I clean more than 500 air conditioners a year.  When I got tired of using hoses that kinked, sprayed  water over me from leaks in the hose or fittings, were difficult to reel or  stow and had squashed, stamped-brass fittings which were hard to screw  attachments to, I bought a Flexogen hose.  Now I have a durable, leak-free  hose which stands up to heavy daily use.  It amazes me when I see how many  homeowners have practically unusable hoses once the fittings have been run  over in their driveway.  This hose is (just a little more) money  well-spent."
4.0,This hose is very sturdy and flexible. It's quality is better than what it is priced for.
5.0,I don't have to go out in the rain to read the gauge.  Love it.  Would recommend it to anyone.
5.0,"I got this to replace my old rain gauge that developed a leak.  So far, so good, measured two inches"
5.0,This is a great rain gauge!  I can easily read it from inside the house to its spot in my garden.
5.0,"This is my 2nd unit. The 1st one lasted 8 years and being out in the Florida sun 24/7, thats a darn good record, Thanks for a really good product."
2.0,"Despite the product description of being accurate, the scale is graduated in half-inch increments which is not very precise.  The package did not include mounting screws, but that was only a minor irritant.
Given its large size and lack of precision, I regret having purchased this rain gauge.  I will probably buy a replacement of a different model."
1.0,Rain gauge looks good and is easy to read from our bedroom window. Unfortunately  it appears to have a slow leaks. I did not notice until after I had sent the box to the dump so now it will also go to the dump. One possibility for the leak might be our cold weather but is not oblivious where it is leaking except from somewhere on the bottom of the gauge.
4.0,This is a large rain gauge with the large numbers. It is easy to read at a distance. The only thing I would improve is to color the back of the tube black so that the yellow numbers are easier to read.
5.0,Love the big size! It's so easy to have it hanging on the fence in the yard and still see & read the gauge.
5.0,Best gauge ever!  Mine is  8-9 years old - still great.  I bought these for special friends who had admired mine.
4.0,It's a BIG rain gauge.  I don't have to go outside (in the rain or the cold) to see how much we received.  It is easy to view from a distance.  Can easily see it from inside the house across the 25 foot deck where it is mounted by the firewood.  A little pricy for this all plastic gauge but my first one lasted a number of years even though it stayed out year round in Northern VA.
5.0,"I bought this because I have a large yard that the cheaper brands were not handling well, based on all the high ratings, and largely to see if it was really as hard to put together as a lot of reviews said. I have to say I had it put together in under an hour, and my seven year old son was helping me. I will agree the instructions aren't the greatest, but just thinking about what a spreader should look like and looking at their diagrams, I felt it wasn't anything to detract from a high rating.  I'll admit I didn't read any of it. I just looked at the drawings to get the bolt length and to see what holes to use. Maybe the written instructions are tripping people up.

I immediately loaded it with fertilizer and off I went. It is very smooth and broadcasts beautifully. I was worried about the lever and 'door' not being smooth to close once it was loaded, but mine shut effortlessly.  The only minor negative experience I had is what they all do when they are almost empty. Since the drop holes are on the left side. It started only spreading to the left when I was down to the very bottom since the fertilizer was dropping enough. Like I said, this is common to all of them in one way or another trying to use up all of the fertilizer versus dumping it back in the bag.

I love the round hopper versus the square ones on most others. The wheels glide over uneven land. I like that the handle length is adjustable. I went with the middle length. I will probably keep it there.

I would have liked to have seen a metal bearing in the shaft versus a plastic collar at this price point. Time will tell if that is a longevity issue.  I have a feeling it will be fine.

I am very impressed with it, and I'm glad the assembly horror stories didn't steer me away. I should start a business of assembling them for people for $20. I'd be rich. ;-)"
5.0,"Great spreader!  It works fast and allows tall people to stand up straight when using.  Your back will thank you at the end of a long day! Be aware that it does NOT have a calibration that will match typical home spreaders offered in home centers.  Its uses a professional calibration of ""pounds per square foot"".  You can easily convert but it will require and additional step."
5.0,I found this spreader to be just what I was looking for. Assembly was a bit trying at times but was worth the extra hassle due to the ability to adjust for users height during the process. Rolls Like a dream and can be adjusted for amount of spread on the fly. Good stuff
2.0,"During assembly I noticed one of the wheels did not slide on the axle all the way to the end but left a good 1"" gap short.  I called customer support and was told that a sales rep would respond to my concern. I asked to speak with a technician and not a sales person.  The sales rep responded that this is how it is designed without answering my question.  I have assembled many garden implements and have never seen this.  What will happen is the axle end will round out the inside of the wheel over time.  Poor design and even a poorer response from the manufacturer.  Do not recommend."
5.0,Got this delivered and put it together in about 2 hours.  This is an awesome spreader and is really sturdy!!
3.0,"I bought this because the price was very good. The good price came with its own price...namely the installation. It was very hard to put together and the instructions were complicated. If you are a mechanical person, you'll do OK. If you are befuddled by mechanical things, hire someone to assemble it for you."
5.0,"Took my time putting the spreader together.  If I had to do it a second time, it would have been a snap.  Knowledge is power.  But compared to my old Ortho broadcast spreader, this Earthway is well built and I expect it to travel much better over my sun-baked south Texas lawn and back forty.  The wheels are a dream."
5.0,bought this to replace a cheaper brand....assembly was rather easy...my property has a steep hill and this spreader work really well.
5.0,"I have used plenty of Lesco spreaders in my day as well as the cheap Scott ""Fisher Price"" like spreaders.  This one is right up there with the Lesco brand spreader.  Easy to fill, easy to set the drop amounts and easy to maneuver.  You cannot beat this spreader for the price!!!"
5.0,"This spreader is made of materials that will insure many years of use.  It is easy to clean after use and the rubber tires get good traction when compared to the common plastic ones on other spreaders.  The only problem I see is that the spreader does not fit my wife's hands, but that is common with all the lawn equipment I own."
5.0,Previous product lasted 12 years. Quick dependable deilivery. It's accurate and easy to mount on fence. Easy to see from a distance
5.0,"So far it's great haven't had it that long but I love the big numbers, easy to read and very easy to remove to empty the water"
5.0,This is our second one and we love it.  It is bigger than most rain gauges and easy to read.
5.0,I love this gauge as it is plenty accurate(some interpretation required) and I can see it way out in the yard from my warm dry house!
5.0,"We use our rain gauge all the time.  We've had to ""recolor"" the floating ring, tho.  It keeps fading in the sun. Perhaps they will consider selling the gauge with two rings.  This is the second one we've had."
5.0,"My dad had another product that became brittle and hard to read over time, so I bought this as a replacement for his old one. He absolutely loves it because it is so easy to read and maintain. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is interested in tracking precipitation."
2.0,"I just received this gauge, so I haven't even installed it yet and of course have no idea whether it's accurate or not. Regardless, it's not worth the cost. When I ordered it 9/13, it was priced at $25.45 with free shipping. Now one week later, it is priced at $19.91 + $5.35 shipping which is roughly the same price so I guess the ""free shipping"" wasn't. This is at least $10 too much. It's nothing more than a cheap plastic tube with a funnel.

I also wish I had noted the dimensions.  It is very large and unsightly. Finally, it was poorly packaged and arrived with minor dents in the tubing."
3.0,"The rain gauge is great, but have had to buy 3 because the holder for the gauge doesn't hold up.  I have had them break within a year.  Have not been able to get a replacement holder."
3.0,"I'd give the gauge a 4, but why do companies demand a physical address and then use a shipping company that turns your parcel over to the USPS? I am not set up for postal delivery at my physical address, so of course when it goes toUSPS, it cannot be delivered. I eventually got it after a couple of weeks on my efforts to track it down. If they accepted PO boxes, I'd have hit in a couple of days."
5.0,A little damage by postal service.  A new one on the way. to me a highly treasured item...Very practical.  No other like it.
5.0,"Package arrived in box , box not crushed was in perfect shape.  Assembly instructions were excellent, calibration was easy, parts were all there.  Big tires glide over the lawn, hopper holds about 40 lbs of weed and feed, you must be moving before you open chute and close chute when you stop.  Golf courses use Andersen spreaders that can cost $350 to $675 of coarse they have grease fittings at axle bearings and have a bigger hopper but this earthway 2150 model is right up there in quality.  I have used it already and it works great spreads evenly and pushes easily..Good bye lawn service this spreader covers a big yard with ease just hose it off after use and it will last for years.  Excellent USA product."
5.0,"Look, I've paid opver $450 on a Lesco Spreader, which has parts that can only be bought through an appropriate dealer or seller.  The Earthway 2150 Commercial spreader has parts that can be replaced be going to your local hardware store!
Also - Fertilizer and Salt both eat away at metal, but the Earthway Spreader has PLASTIC parts that will not be damaged to to chemical deterioration.
Oh - did I mention the Earthway Spreader and all the parts are MADE IN AMERICA ??"
5.0,"After all the reviews about assembly, I was a little apprehensive. It seemed like the quality was good once assembled, but the assembly process itself was a nightmare. Well, as another reviewer stated, the instructions have been updated and are VERY easy to follow. I had mine done in 50 minutes. Once it was done I gave her a test drive. Very nice unit. Scotts garbage be gone..."
5.0,"I got this for spreading salt and it functioned perfectly all through a New York State winter. The spreader is very reasonably priced and strongly constructed. It does take some effort to assemble the 2150, but it's not rocket science and just requires time. The hopper holds plenty of salt and the plastic mesh strainer top ensures that you don't dump in salt clunkers by mistake. Even if you do accidentally load a few clunkers, the design of the sliding door salt port at the bottom of the bucket is easy to access and clear out. My last spreader didn't stand up too well as most of the metal parts corroded away from salt exposure. This unit looks like it will last a long time."
5.0,What a great product! My back no longer hurts from bending to reach the handle! When you're tall all others just make life hard!
5.0,"FINALLY!  My old Scotts EdgeGaurd spreader broke this spring so now I can justify buying a new spreader!  I hated that old spreader.  It was hard to push because of the plastic wheels, the handle was too low and it didn't spread very far.  But man have things changed now that I've got me a good spreader!!  This new Earthway spreader is friggin awesome!  The pneumatic tires make pushing this over the lawn a dream.  And no more hunching over to push that old Scotts P.O.S. spreader.  The extended handle in this spreader makes it a breeze to push while walking in the upright position.  And because this spreader has a much wider throw than the old Scotts one did, you can cover your entire yard in fewer passes and/or get better overlap.

Now a lot of people complain that this spreader took them two or three hours to assemble.  Really?  REALLY????  Just relax, settle down and look at the pretty pictures.  Took me about 40 minutes and I didn't have any issues during assembly.  And in the end I got the best spreader in the neighborhood.  Seriously!  The first time I was out spreading I had two neighbors come over to check out my new wheels!!"
5.0,Built well very easy to push even fully loaded. Wide pattern which cut down on the number of passes required to complete job. More money than a spreader bought at box store but worth it. Setting on spreader are not the same as what you typically find on product bags. You will need to do the math to find out pounds per square foot. Once done just write it down in you manual.
4.0,"This is definitely the Rolls Royce of fertilizer spreaders, but needs better assembly instructions which are a bit confusing.
Maybe something was lost in the translation."
5.0,I have had a number of Scott's spreaders and they always seem to have problems after using them for more then a year.  I have used this product with no problems and even got the conversion scale for Lesco products.  Another great experience with Amazon and there products.
5.0,"No lie, it was a challenge to put together, I am mechanically inclined and this was frustrating at times to put together. The problem is the instruction suck; plain and simple. I figured it out and it is built to last and works great, I had this for 2 years now."
5.0,This hard to find rain gauge was exactly what we were looking for! You can read it from across the yard.
4.0,"large basic rain guage, works quite well and can easily be see from a distance with floating marker, easy to mount with a screw driver"
5.0,Easy to install and read from a distance. Hold up to 5 inches of rain. Has a red float to measure rainfall.
5.0,I had no problem mounting this ( I'm an 80 yr. old woman)  I can read it from where I sit.  It's very accurate. I did have to add something because I have it too close to the bird feeder ( only 6' away) and the birds tended to drop seeds into it.  Once I got the seeds out I cut a circle of screen and placed it at the bottom of the opening with a touch of glue ( i used gorilla glue) to hold it in place so it wouldn't blow away. It works just fine and no seeds get to the bottom of it. I did think that it took a long time for delivery even though it did arrive on the last day. JB
5.0,The product came quickly and undamaged.  This was a hard to find item in local stores and glad I could get one here.  I really like how it is easy to read.
5.0,We had one like this for many years and the seals finally gave out.  This one was an improvement of the previous one and has no seals to wear out and the indicator floats much better.  The design makes it easy to read from any distance.
5.0,"This brand rain gauge has been my favorite for the past 20+ years.  This is only the third on in all that time.  It's easy to read at a distance which allows for real flexibility in where it's located. The price is up from the first one I bought(no big news there), but it's still my first choice."
5.0,Fun. Lightweight. I can see how much rain we had from the bedroom window. Looks good and is easy to hang.
5.0,"I love this large, easy to read rain gauge! I have had mine for over a year now and the gauge is in an open area that receives direct sun all day. The plastic is very durable! The sun/heat has not made the gauge turn yellow or brittle. Definitely recommend."
5.0,"I ordered two, one for my daughter, since they are so visible from a distance. After ordering them, I finally found them locally for the same price."
5.0,"Easy to build, nice size,easy to hook up to lawnmower, the control is easy to use also it spreads even . works great on inclines as well."
5.0,"Easy assembly. I was able to cut down the time it took me to fertilize the lawn by half. It's a little larger than my old drop spreader, but it still moves easily with a load. It's been several weeks, now, since I fertilized and the lawn looks uniformly green and healthy."
5.0,"this is a great spreader, assembled easily and worked perfect right out of the box. I would definitely recommend this product."
5.0,High quality and not to difficult to assemble.  Works very well once you understand how to adjust settings. I would purchase again.
5.0,"Some assembly required but boy does this make fertilizer application easy. I used to have a drop spreader and endured using it until we bought more property. This thing lays down some fertilizer. Takes longer to clean it than do my acre. I don't see why it won't last a lifetime. I you are up against edges all of the time you might want to get the directional plates offered. Oh yea, I just double checked, made in USA. Finally something that has some quality left in it."
5.0,"I always had that cheap crappy plastic fertilizer spreader that half the time would just slide across the grass or not throw any product down and just plain sucked. So when my buddy would show up every spring to aerate my yard i would use his commercial spreader. This one is just as good but with the smaller hopper. Goes together fairly easy because the instructions are a little vague in some areas, but once together it is solid and tight. Worked flawlessly throwing down 8 fifty lb bags with no issues. Shoulda got the 100lb hopper version tho because this thing throws the product heavy but evenly. I set it at 25 and it was plenty heavy enough to not have to make second pass. Great product and good price. Have a nice summer"
4.0,"I like it because it seems to be structurally sound, built to last.  It still has to be maintained.  I have only used it once.
The removable screen is a nice feature.
I dislike it because it was somewhat of a chore to put together.
When spreading material at times it was noticeably uneven from one side of the spreader to the other.

I have used the scotts spreader definitely lighter, and not as robust. I would consider it for lighter duty infrequent use.

I would recommend it."
5.0,I shopped for a nice spreader and i bought this one. It is great .The ratings said the instructions were shaky. They were right. Was kinda a pain to put together. But it was worth it. Very nice spreader. And it was made in America..
3.0,For this amount of money I expected a bit better product. The assembly instructions are absolutely horrid. Maybe my expectation were a bit to high for this product.
5.0,This is a great spreader for the price.  Similar ones are much more expensive.  Very easy to push even in South Florida's thick grasses.
5.0,This is a replacement for one we have had for years and has just worn out. The best one we have ever owned. Easy to read from quit a distance and durable.
4.0,"Love it , with the large size and numbers you can read it with just a glance.

Don't have anything to dislike about it."
5.0,It is simple to mount. Can be seen from a distance without using a telescope. Replaces one just like it that I have used for several years.
4.0,"We've always had a rain gauge similar to this as we tack it on our fence and can see the total rain amount.  I only gave it 4 stars because they do not take the green ring color around the entire gauge only shows the green line on the front making it a little difficult to see the rain amount unless you are facing the front of the gage.

I would recommend it."
5.0,"These rain gauges are the perfect backyard item.  Can be seen from quite a distance, are extremely accurate.  Have two up aty any time in different parts of the yard. Never let me down."
5.0,Love the fact that we can see the rain total from a distance...no more wet footprints in the house...keeps me out of trouble!
5.0,"Love the size, easy to read and easy to install.
Great way to monitor the amount of rain from storms."
5.0,"I live in the tropics, so the wet season is REALLY wet! this gauge is ideal for a quick reference of the daily rainfall. had one a few years ago and loved it!"
5.0,"I have it mounted on a fence twenty feet from house, to get accurate reading, not blocked by trees or buildings, easy to reed from inside, with the red float."
5.0,"Shipment arrived early, undamaged. Installation was a breeze. Now I can see the rain total from about 50 feet away in the house."
5.0,"You have to assemble this yourself, so have some tools and mechanical ability if you order it. The end result is oustanding. Works well, easily adjustable. HEAVY DUTY. Highly recommend."
2.0,well I don't believe someone paying the amount of money for this item should have to put it together and worry about calebrating it and hoping he has the settings right so whatever is being spread is the proper amount.  No I would not refer this item to anyone.  Next time I will buy locally  lesco product  no where in your ad do you say or refer to some  assembly required  because I would not have bought it
5.0,"Very pleased.

This spreader is far superior to what was available to me locally.  Yes, it did take 2 hours to assemble.  Not 2-hours-holding-the-directions-sideways-and-swearing, but there was a lot to do.  This directions must have been updated since some of the other reviews... they aren't great, but they were typical/decent.

Assembled, this thing is very sturdy.  Simply no comparison to the Scott's spreader it was replacing - real tires, metal connectors from settings to dispenser, solid handles, etc.  A huge bonus for me (6'6) is the adjustable handles, which are extend enough to be the right size for me - and solid at that length, too.  If they only made lawn mowers!"
5.0,"Much sturdier than the light duty green spreader that I had previously.  Spreads evenly, and the wheels can handle uneven surfaces.  I normally use a leatherman tool for EVERYTHING, but I borrowed a socket set for this project.  With the proper tools, assembly took a bit longer than 1/2 hour.  The directions were adequate - it always helps me to lay out the parts before starting.  The one complaint that I have (not worth taking off a star) is that the handle height is not easily adjustable, which would be a nice feature if two people are going to use it."
4.0,I love this spreader but the settings suggested were too high. I had to cut them in half to get proper coverage.
4.0,The Earthway 2150 Commercial 50-pound Walk-Behind Broardcast Spreader met all my expectations. It is constructed with heavy duty materials is easy to use and holds a full 50lb. bag of turf ferilizer. My lawn encompasses 1.5 acres and I was able to apply 350 lbs. of turf fertilizer quickly and with minimal effort. Product assembly required 1.5 hours. I would recommend that prior to assembling this spreader that the purchaser read the assembly instructions several times to become familiar with all the parts. Hand tighten all nuts and bolts first to insure proper placement of all parts. This product far exceeds the quality of any fertilizer spreader that you will find in the large box stores.
4.0,"Like most people I have been through a few cheap Scotts and other spreaders. They are ok if you have a very small lot or want to replace it every 3 years or so. I finally mad the plunge, and bought this. It works great and seems much more robust than most spreaders. It's a little bit of a pain to assemble, but do-able. The  T handle and rod controller are great, the handle can be adjusted for your height and the  9in pheunamatic tires are the best for all lawns that aren't like a putting green.  Got it at Amazon for $159"
5.0,"I laughed at the thought that so many people were complaining about the assembly of this spreader. When I opened the box I again thought what could be the big deal. Well I was wrong. The assembly of this thing is a nightmare, there are not many parts but the instructions skip all around to the point that they make no sense. Took me about 90 minutes but I was watching TV, dedicated it would probably have taken like an hour.

Assembled it seems like a nice heavy duty spreader. I don't see how there is any way I'll be able to fit a 50# bag in the hooper but we'll see."
5.0,Assembling this spreader is a nightmare. Once you get it assembled it's great. My other complaint is that this particular spreader had obviously been a previously purchased and returned item. Some of the pieces which were individually wrapped and both ends sealed had been opened and then closed with staples. Some of the pieces were partially assembled and then just placed back in the box with no protective packaging materials. The painted pieces of the frame were scratched and I had to purchase black paint to repaint them to prevent rust. I would have returned it but it was already late in the season and I didn't have any time to waste.
5.0,"I followed directions and hints and had no problem assembling.
I have only used once and it worked great, next use will be in June."
5.0,Perfect basic hose. Good color.
3.0,"Over the years I've purchased dozens of Flexogen hoses and have been generally very happy with the quality, longevity, and customer service. However the latest 75ft 5/8 Super Duty Flexogen hose is much thinner and flimsier than previous Flexogen hoses. Has Gilmour reduced the quality, or is this not a 5/8 hose? I'm not about to cut the hose to check :-)"
5.0,So far so good. Not too heavy and does seem kink resistant. Will see how sun resistant it is as it sits in full sun year round in the NM desert. Though wish it was a green/teal color instead of grey.
4.0,good hose hope it passes the test of time
5.0,Using this hose from the spigot to a dripline. I expect to have this outside all summer is brutal conditions and this hose definitely seems up for the challenge. Super strong material and outer coating as well as strong metal connections. This hose seems like it can take a serious beating. Will update if anything goes wrong with it but can't imagine it will. Really solid product!
2.0,Burst first time I used it to connect to an insecticide sprayer to eliminate whiteflies on shrubs
5.0,Item as described.  Received quickly.
5.0,gill are is the best she you can buy
5.0,"Very heavy duty, just what I needed for the Colorado elements."
5.0,Great hose....
4.0,The rain gauge is large and easy to read.  The picture is what you get. The plastic cylinder is a little weak and mine came creased in the mail.  Dont expect a really solid rain gauge but it should still do the job.
5.0,"Living in drought stricken Southwest Texas, there presently isn't much need for a rain gauge. I had to replace another one that was destroyed by hail. The extra large print is easy to read, even from a reasonable distance. It seems to be quite accurate (measuring what little rain has been received and comparing to ""lab test tube"" type gauges). I recommend this product."
5.0,This rain gauge outlast all my other rain gauges.  It is the easiest to read and cold weather won't crack it like the hard plastic rain gauges.  I recommend this rain gauge if you want one to last for many years and easy to read.
4.0,It was somewhat damaged but still worked okay. It must have been bent in shipment as it was dented in in a couple of places. We pushed it out pretty well and mounted it on our fence and it has worked effectively.
5.0,"Love this rain gauge.  You can read it from a great distance, and it's really nice to know how much rain made it to your backyard.  It's also an attractive part of my deck!"
4.0,"An E-Z Read Jumbo Rain Gauge has been in our yard for the past decade.  It is easily readable from across the yard, simple to empty and a hardy survivor of northern climes. Though we do bring it inside throughout the winter's hard freeze, it has been occasionally left in the elements through subzero temperatures and seems none the worse-for-wear.  One thing prevents 5 stars for this version of the gauge:  Our prior model had a removable bottom, with a rubber ring sealing it.  The new version has a bottom which does not seem removable.  This will prevent us from thoroughly cleaning the gauge as leafs, dirt and other schmootz accumulates over the years."
5.0,"I bought this as a replacement for the same model that was at least 6 or 7 years old. It was still working fine, but I accidentally broke it when putting it back out this spring.  I hoped the new one would be as good as the old one and I was not disappointed.  The bright orange level marker and big numbers are easy to read from around 15 away.  Everyone in the family ends up looking out there after a big rain.  Well worth the price."
5.0,"Excellent rain catcher and recorder,catches a lot of water that we use on our indoor plants. Would recommend to anyone."
5.0,"i wouldn't want to be without my rain gauge.  It is easily installed, easily emptied and i love the large numbers"
5.0,"I can read this one from a distance. It is just a rain gauge, not much to go wrong with it. It is big and sturdy (not real sturdy but if you are not using it as a baseball bat, no need) and it is accurate."
5.0,"The assembly instructions were like what everyone says-- not too good.
I spent about an hour and ten minutes putting it together.
There was definitely some trial and error on some of the parts.
But rest assured-- Everything fits together nicely in the end.

The all rod control system is a delight. Calibration is easy.
It drives like a dream. For those of you coming from a Scotts ""Speedy Green"", the difference is amazing.
The adjustable handle was a nice surprise.

The instructions include a pair of tables that allow you to apply any product at the required rate.
The derived setting seems high to me.
Working at about 1/2 of the calculated setting is probably prudent.
You can always make another pass if you need too.

I applied Milorganite (36 pounds per 2500 Sq Ft) at the wide open setting. WOW!
This rig can really lay out a product in a hurry.
Dialing back that back to about half was closer to what the bag called for.

I tried some left over Turf Builder. Again, the calculated rate seemed high.
One pass, and the hopper was empty.

This machine will spread a lot wider than what you might be used to, so a little trial and error is in order."
3.0,I loved the idea of commercial spreader for our 1.5 acre land. We got the package as promised and it's well packed. But when I start to assembly it everything went wrong. English is not my native language and I don't have any idea what the assembly manual trying to say. I assembly all kind stuff but this manual is horrible. I work for years ISO 9000 so I know what a manual has to be and it's not. I wish I saw the all tools and name graphic at the first page. They're all the way back pages. Otherwise unit is looking good. But the pin which is inside bucket may be little longer to sweep inside the bucket.
5.0,"Used twice and find it to be a big improvement over my Agri-Fab broadcast spreader. That said, unit comes completely unassembled (price was most reasonable from my research but how much is your time worth?) so figure on 3-4 hours to assemble. At least that is what it took me. The flow control bar for the hopper control is not easily followed from the directions and that took me far too long to figure out! Setting the calibration will also create some frustration. Anyway, pneumatic wheels like my last unit work very well and are smooth as can be. The spread is much wider (may four feet or more in total) so makes for fewer passes on my 1.5 acres, and unit is smooth. appears to be well built with a closed gearbox, the cause of most units failing from corrosion, wear, or both. We will have to see how long this one lasts using just lime and fertilizer."
5.0,"This machne is great. Took some time to assemble, but it works like nothing I have ever tried. I am tall, so the handle and controls are super erognomic and simple to use. No bending and easy to push. The large wheels are great across our 2/3 acre lot.

This is so much better than the store bought spreaders. Great unit."
5.0,"Easy to push, and the broadcast span is great.  I recommend this spreader to anyone, and the price is less than your local hardware and garden centers."
3.0,"It took 3 hours to assemble this spreader yet it should have taken 30 to 60 minutes. Amazingly poor diagrams, descriptions and instructions. A few labels on the parts here and there would have helped immeasurably. I do all my own car repairs (I've rebuilt front ends, replaced clutches, etc) and I have every tool known to man.

There is nothing hard about the assembly that better diagrams and clearer instructions would not fix. If I had another spreader to assemble right now, I bet I could do it in  about 30 minutes. But I do wonder about a company that can't find the time to create better instructions, given all the complaints. If you are like me, handy with tools, you will assume you can assemble this spreader quickly and will ignore all the complaints.  You will ultimately find out you were very wrong!

The build quality is decent but far from commercial or high quality. I doubt the spreader would hold up under regular day to day use for very long. I'll hope, it will last many years, given the light usage, typical of many homeowners. But for the price, I expected much more, in overall quality.

The warranty is dubious at best - here is a direct quote - ""Due to the corrosive nature of most fertilizers and ice melt products, Earthway, makes no warranty against and specifically excludes part(s) or product degradation or failure due to corrosion or its effects, or the use of powdered products"".

Elsewhere, in the manual, it states (in very large type): ""Rock Salt and Powdered Materials should not be used ... use only granular materials"". I'll add that even ""granular"" materials contain a fair amount of dust as I just witnessed when I used this spreader for the first time. Evidently I've already voided the warranty since some powder was evident in the granular lime I just spread.

Only time will tell how well this spreader will hold up under light use. The warranty seems to be largely an advertising gimmick.

I can certainly appreciate the number of 5 star reviews if your only comparison is an inexpensive drop spreader (Scotts, etc). I had an Agri-Fab spreader and during its three year lifespan it was FAR BETTER than the Earthway: slightly easier to push, held much more fertilizer and broadcast far wider. If not for fatal design flaws, ie, corrosion and a cheap hopper - it was better than the Earthway in every respect. But it only lasted for 3 seasons - maybe 9 total uses.

Compared solely to a very cheap spreader - this is a 5 star product! But a few years down the road will you still feel it was a wise investment? I don't know. Obviously, I hope so, since I now own one. Only time will tell if this spreader will hold up but I feel many 5 star reviews are overly optimistic.

Second thoughts: While it is too late for me - I'm wondering if I should have just purchased another Agri-Fab spreader and accepted the fact it might corrode after a few years. Prices have dropped to half of what I previously paid for my Agri-Fab. This Earthway holds less fertilizer and broadcasts the fertilizer in such a small arc I really doubt the wisdom of my purchase.

But my perspective is far different from that of many reviewers. I previously owned a commercial spreader and not a cheap Scotts or other drop spreader. This Earthway holds about half the fertilizer of the Agri-Fab and broadcasts in half as wide an arc."
4.0,"Good product. Takes a little time, trail and error to assemble. Has held up to 1 month of heavy use. Hopper is better suited for 40 # bags."
5.0,"This broadcast spreader worked great. I owned a Scotts spreader before this EarthWay and the Scotts spreader does not even compare to the Earthway.  You get what you pay for. The Earthway spreader is kind of expensive but it should last me a lifetime. Good quality. The job goes faster due to it spreads out the fertilizer farther.

The spreader applied the fertilizer real evenly. Plus it has a wide coverage area. Maybe 9 feet wide. It depends on what you are putting down.  The spreader is so comfortable. The handle is nice and long so I don't have to bend over. My Scotts spreader the handle was to short , so I had to bend over to use it and this hurt my back. Tip: The handle has several holes settings to make it longer. If you are under 6' tall the standard holes are fine.

Another feature I just love is it has a temporary screen you put on top of the spreader to catch large chunks of fertilizer that got wet and stuck together. The screen catches it . Then you can take the chunks that are stuck together and rub them across the screen with your hand to crumble them up so they can go out your spreader evenly. What a great feature. Your spreader will not send out large chunks of stuck together fertilizer.

I also like the control rod assemble that adjust the amount of fertilizer you are applying. . Its a metal rod. This should last forever. My Scotts spreader had a cable instead of the steel rod and over the years the cable stretched making it inaccurate to set your spreader rate.

It also has air in the tires to make it a smooth push over a bumpy yard. The wheels are plastic. Maybe that's good because they will not rust.

I like this Earthway spreader so much I would buy another one.

Cons:
1)  I think the instructions are kind of hard to follow. It took me maybe 2 1/2 hours to put together. Tip: read all the instructions first before assembly. This gives you a good idea of how it will look when done.  My suggestion is Earthway should put a video on Google You Tube to show how to put it together. Tip: I did find a similar EarthWay spreader video on You Tube on how to assemble it. . Type in EarthWay Ev-N-Spred Heavy Duty Professional Spreaders.  Another company made a video on how to assemble the spreader. Its a 12 minute video. The video is not the same exact Earthway spreader 2150 , but its close. The only difference in the one on the You Tube video is the way the Pivot Bracket mounts. The pivot bracket mounts on the outside of the handle on the Earthway 2150 . .  The one in the  video they show it mounting on the inside of the handle. The handle is slightly different on the You Tube video. But 90 % of the rest of it is the same thing. This video really makes the assembly easier. Earthway should put videos on Google You Tube. One picture is worth 1,000 words.
2)  The only other thing that kind of bothered me is the manufacturers of fertilizers do not put EarthWay spreader rates on there bags.  Earthway gives you some formulas you have to use.  You will need to no how much square feet you have,  then use there formulas. It was pretty close on the on information they gave me.  You just have to do some math before using the spreader. I always  like to set it at a lower setting to make sure I don't run out of fertilizer. If you have some left over you can always go back over it at a lower rate ."
5.0,"As others have noted, some assembly is required but, if you follow the directions, you should have it ready to go inside an hour. Once outside, it worked great. Throws a nice pattern and cleans up nicely with the garden hose. Experiment a bit with the settings before you roll over your lawn so you don't apply too much or too little fertilizer. This is a great step up from the store bought spreaders I've used in the past."
5.0,"As to other reviews, it did take me the better part of two hours to assemble. With its pneumatic  wheels it glided over my newly sodded 13000 s.f. lawn with ease. The best spreader i have ever owned!!"
1.0,"This spreader arrived broken in multiple places, and the box showed no sign of abuse.  Much of this unit is made out of weak, brittle plastic.  The gearbox mount was broken off the gearbox and some of the flow control pieces were broken off the bottom of the red hopper.  I expected better quality given the price.

Many reviews commented on the apparent durability, but I don't see it... even before I found broken stuff, I thought the (plastic) parts felt ""cheap"" as I removed each one from the box.

My quest to find a decent spreader continues:)"
5.0,"...if only I had purchased my Earthway before I wasted my money (and time) on the Scott's side-guard piece-of-crap. I assembled my new Earthway at work (on my mandated break, of course). My work buds and myself were immediately impressed with the materials quality. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and read the instructions first. :~) No problems with putting everything together. Very sturdy piece of equipement. And the tires actually roll!!! Not scoot/drag like the green thing I used in the past. There is no comparison what so ever between the two. None. Save yourself aggrevation and time. And, if you buy the Earthway (before) you buy something else that is ""probably good enough"", you will even save money in the long run. I spread 13 bags of lime pellets and a few bags of fertilzer yesterday. What a joy!!"
5.0,Hardy product meant for commercial use.  It last for years and years.  It is commercial quality and can be used for hours.
5.0,Finally. Great reliable product. Previously bought 4 plastic Scott's spreaders. This American made product blows them away. I'm done buying spreaders. This will last a lifetime. So easy to push over uneven terrain. Cuts my time by three-fourths.
5.0,"I had bought/broken several Scotts spreaders.  My neighbor (a former landscaper) had an 80 pound Lesco commercial spreader - worked great, way too expensive.  80 pounds was almost a bit much to push around.  Bought this one because of the size, durability, wheels, etc.- plus it was made in America.  Bottom line - best spreader you will ever get for the money.  You will spend 1 1/2 to 2 hours putting it together, but once done, it is great. 50 pounds is a good weight to move around fully loaded.  It spreads evenly, doesn't clog up, and is easy to maneuvre.  Initially, I was a little disappointed that some of the guts were plastic, but looking at my neighbor's Lesco, he said the metal will rust (which it is) and the plastic won't.  I've had it a year now and no issues whatsoever.  I use it for everything from lime to seed to fertilizer."
5.0,"Two words - simply awesome!
I have about 1/2 acre of lawn with the back yard sloping downhill away from the house.  I am one of those wierd guy that actually enjoys yard work.  Having a beautiful lawn for my family to enjoy gives me a lot of satifaction.  I also do all my lawn maintenance - no service here.  Long story short, for the past 11 years, I have been using a P.O.S Scotts spreader from Home Depot.  The Scotts spreader is a complete P.O.S - crappy plastic wheels that are narrowly spaced and wobbles.  It also has a tendency to tip over to the side and spill everything out.  The cheap plastic wheel was also hard to push uphill.  I finally had enough and got the Earthway 2150 commerical spreader.  Wow, what a difference.  Huge pnumatic tires that are wide apart.  All metal frame.  This thing is tough and works like a champ.  If you are still using one of those junk big box store spreader, get rid of it and get this instead.  Highly recommended.  Take your time when putting this together.  It will take about 1 hour.  Aftewards, spray some lithium grease on the moving parts.  Everything should be smooth as butter."
5.0,"Well worth the money, stay away from what the big box stores sell that only last maybe two years, I would recomend this"
5.0,I wasted my $$ on the cheap Lowes and Home Depot Scotts spreaders that break after a few years and are hard to push.  This has nice rubber tires and a longer handle for taller people like me to not break your back.
5.0,"It is easy to push, gets the job done quickly, and is easy to clean up. The adjustable handle is handy for tall and short people."
4.0,"I borrowed my neighbor's Earthway 2150 spreader and after using it I knew I had to have one too.  It spread my fertilizer very easily even though my yard is anything but level or smooth.  I ordered one immediately.  The difference between the Earthway and my current Scotts SpeedyGreen SG-3 rotary spreader , I think, is due to the larger size of tires and considerably longer handle.  However, upon looking at the parts of my Earthway 2150, I did notice that the quality isn't what I was expecting.  For example, the axle is not solid, but is hollow; the wheels are not metal, but are plastic; the gearbox doesn't feel solid, but very light; and the cross brace is also hollow.  So while I'm not impressed with the quality of the parts, I have to remember I was impressed with the function of the spreader which is why I ordered one in the first place.  Only time will tell if the product is actually worth the money; I am very hopeful."
5.0,"I have this mounted right outside my kitchen window, several feet from the house so that run-off from the roof does not reach the gauge.  Large numbers and markings are easy to read.  The gauge top is removable for cleaning.  Trash, such as oak tree ""droppings"" in the Spring, will get into the gauge but are easily rinsed out with the top removed."
5.0,"This was a replacement for one I had for about 15 years. It's great, easy to read and very durable."
5.0,"I bought this jumbo rain gauge in a local big box hardware store about 10 years ago, and it had served us well until it split at the bottom after a freeze.  This was my fault, in that I usually would bring it in during the colder months.
I was glad to find a replacement on Amazon, and bought 2 of them.  The new one is exactly the same as the one I bought 10 years ago - same receiver/holder, so I simply slid the new tube into the old mount.  We have the rain gauge attached to one slat of our wood fence, with the funnel protruding about 3 inches above the top of the fence.
We can read the gauge from inside the house - probably about 50 feet away.  You can easily drain it after a rain, and periodically clean it if needed.  This rain gauge is the best I've seen.  I am highly recommending it."
5.0,"It is easy to read, and easy to empty. I had one at my previous residence for quite a number of years, and was glad to find one for our new residence. Would recommend it."
5.0,"This is the fourth EZ read Jumbo Rain-Gauge I have purchased .  I live in Florida and it stays outside all day long every day for months and years, where it gets beat up by wind and sun and rain.  Our sun is brutal and eventually we are unable to read the markings on the outside so we buy a new one.  It stands up to the elements beautifully - no cracking or breakage.  I LOVE this rain gauge!!!"
5.0,"I chose this rating because I do, indeed, LOVE it.  We had a rain gauge just like it for many years and I had fun keeping track of the monthly rainfall at our house. But it finally succombed to the elements a few years ago and it was replaced by a different rain gauge.  For some odd reason thatt rain gauge did not work  and my search for a new one commenced on Amazon.com.  Finally the B&L E-Z Read was found on Amazon and I ordered it immediately.  With binoculars I can see the rain gauge which is mounted to a fence post about 100 ft. from our house.  All is right with the world again."
5.0,This is probably our fourth or fifth Jumbo Rain-Gauge.  We feel that it fits our requirements perfectly.  We're happy that you still offer it.
5.0,This thing is huge and easily readable from my house window to the back of my yard. I would recommend it.
5.0,We bought this as a replacement. We like it because the printed numbers are large and easily seen from inside the house on a rainy day.
5.0,Five stars for making it simple and easy to check on just how much it has rained.  The red disc floats on top of the water level making it crystal clear from 40 feet away how much rain has fallen.
5.0,"I purchased the 2-arm whirling Nelson sprinkler in 2006.  It was awesome.  I have now purchased the 3-arm.

I have a 1/3-acre+ yard in Florida, and primarily have rainbirds on Gilmour timers.  However, rainbirds form inefficient arcs, so I have always had to manually water in spots that are difficult to reach or that get too much sun and burn up in the summers.  This is especially a consideration, now that water prices are rising, and are expected to rise again.

I have experimented with many circular and portable sprinklers through the years.  The primary complaint is that they force the water too high, causing two problems:  first, the water hits tree branches, dropping the stream straight down and interfering with your goal, and second, a high  spray is carried away on any light breeze.  So, you cannot water under a short tree efficiently, nor can you water well at dusk, (the best time to water!) because that is when the sea-land breeze begins for those of us inland, and gives the welcome break from the heat and reduces evaporation on the lawn.  Thus, if a sprinkler sprays very high, you're now watering the next person's property.

When I purchased the 2-arm version in 2006, I immediately discovered, to my delight, that the little black ends, although they appear stationery, can be gently bent.  They can stay horizontal to the arms (as pictured), which throws the water up to only about 4-5 feet (what a relief), OR they can even be bent slightly downward, which means they are now more horizontal with the ground.  This is a very minute adjustment that produces a huge affect.  You now can water under trees without wastage, and have less blowing around the neighborhood.

In addition, the sprinkler has survived the durability test: being pulled to every dry spot in the yard, sometimes banging into trees on the way.  One of my kids tripped over it, bent the black end, and I just bent it back.

It produces a fine spray, and has no dead spots like rainbirds tend to do get when they age and get off-kilter.  They also have no open holes big enough for a mini-gecko to crawl up into and get away from the heat (yes!) and completely plug up the system, requiring 20 minutes in the garage.

At full pressure, the little guy could lay a lot of water on the lawn in a much shorter time than any of my previous sprinklers that were more aerial.  But even better, here in Florida, we're all trying to water on the same restricted days!--so water pressure is often stressed.  But it is a champ under low pressure!  It even responds to teency pressure:  if I put it under my roses (which cannot have water on the leaves), and turn it to very low, it makes a slow, steady spiral underneath them. Any other sprinkler would simply be sputtering and gurgling."
5.0,"Cannot beat this spinkler for it's durability and simplicity of use.  We had an old, old, old 3 arm whirling sprinkler and our neighbors had  all the different new kind of wands and sputtering ones.  All of a sudden I noticed that they are using the Metal 3-Arm Whirling Sprinkler too.  So - it's a keeper and now I am ordering another one not to replace the 30 year old sprinkler we have but we need another one because of the size of our yard.

Mary"
3.0,"Works fine.  Good set, good sharpness."
5.0,great price and blades that seen to need every year
3.0,okay
3.0,"Breaking and short useful life span are 'chronic and manageable' issues, the planned obsolescence ca$h cow of the producers. Where are the 20+ year German or Swedish blades of the past? On my saws, I got these for spares."
2.0,"Gilmour (Bosch) has gone over to the dark side!  And by that I mean this bow saw blade, that was once made in Denmark using Swedish steel is now made in . . . guess where . . . if you said CHINA you'd be right on the money.  Now, I happen to have two Swedish steel blades both made in Denmark as I write this.  Both are over 15 years old, both were bought at the exact same time, one is currently in the saw, and one is still in the package unused.  The one in the saw though a lot rusty is still sharp and working well but getting long in the tooth and won't last much longer.  I ordered this blade (after researching its country of origin on the Internet) and found that it was billed as a top quality Denmark blade.  They lied!  BTW, not Amazon's fault, though I do wish Amazon would start mentioning the country of origin in their product descriptions.  Compared side by side with a 15 year old brand new Denmark blade this China blade is a cheap piece of Chinese ""you know what"" and that is just from a purely visual inspection.  I'll go ahead and put it in the saw handle and use it and I'll save my Swedish steel blade for when this cheap hunk of junk wears out (won't take long).  By then maybe I can locate a good blade to have on ""back up"" when I do have to start using my Swedish steel blade.  I would normally give something like this only one star but as the blade looks like it might possibly last two years (being generous here) along with being an Amazon Prime item I gave it two.  Long story short, if you want a top quality blade, look elsewhere!"
5.0,This was gift for my husband who loves gadgets.  It actually rained when we returned home from Christmas and he loves using it.
5.0,This was a gift. I already have one and I like it. Make sure you don't leave it out in the winter.
3.0,Did not ship screws so that the gage could be mounted. I will be very easy to read once I find screws so that I can place it outside.
5.0,Works great and easy to view with the orange float.  The funnel makes it accurate when comparing with local reports.
5.0,"I have tried several different type of rain gauges and find this one the be the old reliable. It is large enough to be seen at t distance, easy to keep clean and accurate. Recommended."
5.0,We had one of these same gauges for 10 years and loved it! It finally cracked (after 10 years!) so we wanted a new one. Just what we were looking for!
4.0,I bought this as an exact replacement since the one I had cracked over time.  Can ready from miles away!
5.0,This is my second. The first one still functions fine only the lettering has faded after five years of use.
5.0,"This was just what I wanted and I got it for a SUPER price.  Shipping was fast also. If you need a
rain guage, this is the one for you!"
5.0,"I have my rain gauge affixed to the top of a metal pole about 5 inches above the top of the pole.  I can see it well from the house.  We live in the country, so rain is our primary concern.  I have had two of these rain-gauges over the years and just cannot do without them.........."
5.0,The spreader works well - it is easy to use and spreads evenly - much better than the cheaper spreader I bought at a big box store. The assembly requires some patience and serious thought.
5.0,"Like so many of you, I've had it with the cheaply made units from the big box stores, so I figured I'd pay the price for quality.  I was a bit skeptical about how the assembly would go after reading all of the reviews, but I did not have any of the issues that so many others had.  If you're mechanically inclined, it's pretty straight forward, at least to me it was.

As far as operational, it works as advertised, a nice steady spread probably covering 12-14 feet.  The conversion table works as it should (it's just a math calculation!), but I'd recommend starting off at a lower setting than you might think.  You can always raise it up a notch if needed.

I definitely recommend."
5.0,"I received the spreader earlier this year and have used it with a variety of fertilizers and could not be more pleased with the performance. Being a commercial spreader the settings for flow are easy to adjust, I walk a little slow than the suggested three miles an hour so I just change flow setting to accommodate my pace. Good quality it's made to last years, my son will get it when he grows up."
5.0,"Spent way too many years doing way too many acres - yes - acres with a plastic wheeled piece of junk.  I love this spreader!

UPDATE July 25, 2013  The plastic plate which controls the flow of fertilizer on the bottom of the hopper decided to become very stubborn this spring.  I took the hopper assembly apart and smeared some vaseline around on all the contact areas of the plate.  It seems to have fixed the issue."
5.0,"This is a very nice spreader.  It feels very solid and the pneumatic tires give it great maneuverability and handling over bumps.  The control arm is solid metal, not a cable, which gives you precise control and will last a long time.  The settings take some experimentation with your various products to get it right, but that is true of any spreader.  It has good distribution... probably flings material a little farther on the right side than the left, but it is far more even than my crappy Edgeguard ever was."
4.0,"Spread the news, This spreader works great. Huge capacity which is nice and stable with large inflatable tires. It has all the features that make it work and last."
5.0,This is a great spreader for anyone who has an acre or more of grass. It's easy to push and rolls smoothly over any surface. It holds a large amount of product and spreads it very evenly. It's worth the investment and I plan on using it for many years.
5.0,"This product will do the trick, it has the ability to spread evenly, Is a little complicated to assembly, however once you understand the principals of the assembly it goes smoothly. I would highly recommend this product and the pricing is affordable and reliable"
5.0,"Have only used this spreader twice (pelletized lime and tall fescue seed)so far on 1.25 acre gently sloping yard...with many dips and depressions. Pneumatic tires make it very easy to push. Operates very well, although it did not appear to distribute the materials completely evenly - left side rec'd more than right, but it is easy to adjust for while walking. Machine cleaned up well after use.

Assembly took a bit of time, but was straightforward. Suggest using wheel grease on the axle assembly and tighten all nuts before mounting tires. Am looking forward to using this machine in the future and more importantly, not having to replace it every other year like one of the big box green machines for homeowners"
5.0,"This is the second Earthway Spreader I have purchased. The first I got at Sam's Club and was very pleased for many years. I did not take care of it properly so I need to replace it. I was very supprized and happy with the new spreader. The handle bars were heaver and longer, tires are larger and spreader control better.
Great spreader I would highly recommend to anyone."
5.0,Very good seller and product
5.0,Very sturdy...but flexible even in winter washing vehicles
5.0,good hose for the money
5.0,OUTSTANDING
1.0,"Junk, won't even uncoil with out a fight."
1.0,Horrible . So not happy. Bought 8 and they all do not work longer than a week. Do not waste your money cause I did
1.0,"I bought this hose a few years ago (2013) and have been very pleased with it.  After more than four years it is still in good shape.  The best part is that it is supple and easy to coil back up on the rack.

I was so pleased with the hose I bought a second one a little over a year ago.  The second hose was a different color and much stiffer than the first. I used the feature on Amazon to ""order again"" and the part numbers are the same for the two hoses.  But the two hoses are not the same.  I usually don't do these reviews but I used that stiff hose again today and in the colder weather it is more trouble than it is worth to coil up.  The older hose on the front of the house is still as limber and flexible as it always is, but this second one is a nightmare and is headed for the trash.  I will have to cut the thing in short pieces to even get it in the garbage can.

I don't know why I didn't send it back when I first got it.  I guess I thought since it was supposed to be the same hose as the first it would limber up.  But now I am thinking Amazon or the vendor for this product pulled a fast one and sent me a cheaper hose in the expensive wrapper."
5.0,"This hose is of excellent quality, has held up well under the Arizona summer heat.  It's very sturdy, but also flexible and doesn't kink.  The first one I ordered had a defect in the o-ring washer and leaked at the hose bib.  I called the company and the immediately sent a second hose out and that one hasn't leaked at all.  Very prompt service and very pleasant customer service representative.  We will definitely by more as we need to replace other hoses for the other hose bibs around the house."
1.0,"Definitely not 25 feet, I regretted my purchase immediately."
5.0,Awesome hose.
5.0,This is an excellent product and it makes short work of planting your  garden. The planter is very efficient and makes super straight rows once  you get started. I planted six rows of sweet corn and three rows of beans  in less than 5 minutes.
3.0,"I purchased this nozzle as it was one of the few claiming to be made in the U.S. Unfortunately, the package says ""made in China."" I believe Gilmour has recently moved all of their production overseas -- sad. That said, it appears to be relatively well made."
5.0,"My experience has been the complete opposite of the other reviewer's.
This is the best nozzle I've owned. That's why I sought out the metal version. I've had 4 of the ""new"" metal ones for 5 years now and they still work perfectly."
1.0,"After only 4 months -- using it perhaps twice a week, at most -- something inside must have burst, and water is spraying all over.  I've had the Orbit version, only a few dollars more, for a full year, with much more usage weekly, and it's in okay shape.  I would steer clear of the Gilmour products based on my experience."
5.0,So far - fantastic! Can produce virtually any spray pattern required to do the job.
5.0,"We had this item at our previous home, and bought another one for our new home.  Easy to read from afar and easy to empty.  Totally satisfactory."
5.0,This was the second rain gauge I had purchased from the company and was happy with the first one- very easy to see the amount of rain.
4.0,"This rain gauge is easy to read and appears to be a durable product.  We have only had one rain since installing it (bad drought right now), but it worked perfectly.  Easy to empty, easy to read from a distance and looks like it will last several years.  They recommend that you bring it in during freezing weather, but we will probably forget to do that.  We left our old one out all winter...LOL.  But it is not expensive, so if we have to replace it in two or three years, big deal.  We really like this gauge."
5.0,I love that I don't even have to go outside to be able to see how much rain we received.
5.0,replacement for one that i had for eight years. original part wore out but never had a problem with it.
5.0,"Adequate because it holds up to 5 inches, and here in the Sierra Nevada foothills we can get that much in 24 hours. It's on a post about 30 feet from a window and I can read it clearly when my glasses are clean. I had a 4"" version of this very model but lost part of it when we moved here but that one was at least 10 years old and looked as good as new. Well; almost. Close enough anyway. So I assume this one will last at least another generation."
5.0,We ordered this product to replace one just like it that we had for several years.  It is easy for us to see at a glance how much rain has fallen. We have it mounted just outside of our patio on our wooden fence.  The only problem is we found the same thing at a local retailer for 1/2 the price.  Oh well.  We still like the product and didn't have to run all over town before we found it.  It saved us gas money and time.
5.0,It works well.  Easy to see across the back yard.  No problems in delivery.  This is our second one to be used at a different location.
5.0,"This rain gauge is a replacement for one that was old and broken.  This is a nice easy to read gauge.  It is exactly like the old one I had to replace, and have had for several years."
2.0,"This rain gauge is not of the quality of the previous gage I had. It is not a jumbo rain gauge as shown on amazon, it is much smaller than the jumbo I had. The size of the gauge in height and the material made out of."
5.0,"I bought this spreader in the beginning of September to replace my old Scotts drop spreader which did not work well. I have about the same opinions as others for the assembly instructions but I managed pretty well without much difficulty. I had just got to use this spreader not long ago and it performed very nice. It is smooth when pushing and the big tires roll nicley on rough terrain. I did notice also as in the previous review about product hitting the top of the tire when the buckets gets low and also how the product tapers and you have to wobble it to get the rest of the product out. However, this happened when using a finer granular product. Have not used it yet on larger granular products. Other than that it works great compared to my other spreader I was using and I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Assembly was a pain since the instructions are awful. As I recall, at least one of the split pins holding the tires on is almost impossible to ""spread"" effectively, and the long threaded adjustment bar for the flow control was too long, causing it to foul the mechanism, making it impossible to fully close, until I fixed it with judicious use of a hacksaw. Took me about 2 hours to get it together.

However, in operation, the device performs well (I've not had any experience with cheapo spreaders, so have nothing to compare it to). Not sure why the rotating spreading disk is not an inch or two higher though - it seems as though a lot of the stuff gets thrown against the top of the tire, especially with lower flow rates. Also, as the hopper empties out, the flow tapers off and you have to wobble the thing to keep it spreading, resulting in slightly inconsistent rates, unless of course, you keep it topped off.
So, in general, I guess the thing is OK, it does the job, but nothing exceptional."
5.0,"Got this a few years ago. Spreads even, holds enough, rides on uneven ground fine, easy to calibrate. Great spreader for a pro or diyer."
5.0,"Don't waste your time and money on the name brand green one's at your local big box stores. This one cost twice as much but worth every cent. It rolls smoothly over rough terrain. The spreader control is equally as smooth. Another nice feature is the plastic grate on top of the hopper to keep out the large clumps. I personally had no trouble with assembly as others have noted, but I will agree that the assembly instructions could be better. Notably the instructions for the assembly of the spreader control. But all that aside this thing is great and I hope for many years of service from it but only time will tell. But for now I'm throughly pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"very nice spreader, assembly was relatively easy.  Pictures could have been better, all in all, not bad.  Calibration instruction very clear, so far i haven't killed the grass."
1.0,"This product much like the 3500 hand spreader fell apart in less than one hour.  When I told them I bought it on Amazon they told me, ""We don't manufacture Amazon.""  Customer Service is a front line of know nothings with a President of Sales that hides out and does not return calls."
5.0,"Not easy to assemble, parts not labeled well, instructions are unclear at times.
However once it is assembled you will be pleased.
Product works well, feels sturdy, spreads evenly, easy to contol.
You will never want to use an inferior model that cost $30 to $50 again.
I would recommend this product"
5.0,I had less expensive units that were JUNK! This may seem a little pricey but you get what you pay for. It's easy to move around and provides an even drop with a full load.
5.0,"Wow, this thing is a tank.  I'm going to stick to the assemble since that's what most people focus on and won't be using it until next weekend due to continued rain in TN.

Definitley a little work.  I consider myself of ""meduim"" competence, with little patience (although as I age, it seems to becoming more prevalent).  from the time I went to the garage until starting to put stuff away, about an 1 hour 45 minutes.

A couple of tips that I believe helped me.  I listed the 12 hardware items on an 11X17 sheet of paper (nuts, bolts, screws, cotter pins, etc.) and laid the hardware out.  Definitely saved me a lot of time.  I printed the directions a week before it got here and reviwed them a few times, step by step.  Really pays as there are little intricacies that could be easily missed.  No doubt, taking time so you don't have to repeat processes helps.

Will come back and update after I get to drive this beast :)

4.0,"Assembly of the Earthway was an unexpected chore. I'm mechanically inclined and literate, and eventually got it all together and working after a couple of false starts. Took about 2 1/2 hours though, thanks to the ambiguous instructions.

No big deal, since you only have to do this once. And, the assembly gave me a chance to examine all the parts carefully. The materials are all sturdy and fit together well.

Filled the hopper with a 40# bag of fertilizer and took off. This thing rolls really smooth. The big grippy tires traversed my rough land like it was a golf green. I'm 5'10"", and the middle handle position is a great fit. You can easily cover a full acre without arm fatique or sore knees.

The broadcast pattern was good, it threw out the granules at least 6 feet on both sides. I set the rate lever in the middle (15), and that appears to work well for fert granules. I'll experiment with this setting a bit later, since it doesn't look like it's prone to accidental overfertilizing. 3 weeks after application, my grass had greened up nice and evenly - no streaks or burnouts to speak of.

Solid, well-engineered, and easy to operate. Nearly perfect in all respects. Only question remaining is how well it performs after several seasons.

UPDATE:1/5/13
Found one of the tires flat prior to fall spreading. No punctures, it just lost air. Pumped it up and finished the job. Next day it was flat again, so I shot some FlatFix into it and it's holding air now. Seems that the plastic rims do not seat the tires as well as metal, but this is the only problem I've had so far."
5.0,Good buy. Very sturdy works great
5.0,Works good
3.0,"Does the job, but the connection rusts out easily."
4.0,Good solid hose - hard to kink.
5.0,"Nice hose, good quality."
5.0,Great garden hose.
1.0,I bought two hoses and the fittings failed within nine months.
1.0,Split after 33 days of limited use. Would SO not buy again.
5.0,worked as intended.
3.0,"So far, after two seasons, the hose has held up to the higher water pressure of my irrigation system. However, the ""kink resistance"" is a myth. The only garden hoses I've used that don't kink are the flexible, lightweight ones that recoil when you shut off the water. However, most of them can't take the water pressure and pop a hole. Still in search of a high-quality, lightweight garden hose that doesn't kink and is easy to store."
5.0,"I got tired of my back hurting after using my Scotts Speedy Green broadcaster.  I'm 6'2"" and had to bend to push the Scotts spreader. So, I bought this one.  It is great! Assembly is easy and only took about 45-min. It is solid and very easy to push which saves my back. Glad I purchased it."
2.0,"I am mechanically inclined and yet it still took me a full two hours to assemble this product.  That is longer than it has taken me to assemble any other consumer product and it is, IMHO, unconscionable for a $160 spreader. The instructions are extremely poor, the process gratuitously difficult and you need to provide your own tools.  Once fully assembled, it appears to be a decent spreader but don't even think about buying this product if you are not prepared for a long and frustrating assembly process.

I will say that Amazon had the best price I could find and the product arrived quickly."
5.0,"I was looking for an affordable yet heavy duty spreader to use in our yard. We have approximately 10,000 sq. ft. of grass and the consumer grade products available either online or at a big box store are not good quality. This spreader is very well constructed with durable parts. No fancy frills, just a well built reliable spreader. Bottom line, this is a great product at a great price."
4.0,"For the moment, I'll give this unit 4 stars based on design, construction and assembly; I'll come back and update the review after a couple of months once I've given it a run around our property a few times.  Our lawn takes 30K sq ft of product coverage per treatment, so it will get a good workout.

First, however, I want to respond to the significant number of complaints regarding the assembly instructions.  All I can is either they've updated the instructions or those who complained are DIY wannabes who don't know the difference between a phillips and a reed and prince screwdriver.  Really, the instructions are just fine if you'll take just a few minutes and familiarize yourself with the parts and order of assembly.

As far as construction is concerned, three complaints:

1) The axle assembly uses a tube, not a solid rod; I would have preferred to pay the extra two bucks and gotten a solid rod.
2) To describe the 'plastic' parts that the axle runs through as ""bearings"" and ""bushings"" is shameful. Puhleeze !
3) All of the bolts are 1/4"" too long, and two are 1/2"" too long.  The issue here is that the ends of the bolts sticking out (unnecessarily) are a bit of a safety hazard.  It's nothing serious but, what happened with craftmanship ?

The first two items above may not prove to be a problem but, for the money I expected more; they give the feeling of ""Made in China.""  However, because I do expect the plastic bearing and bushing to wear out prematurely, and I otherwise expect this unit to last many, many years, I'm going to order spares rather than 'hope' these parts will still be available when I need them at some point down the road.

Update #1: I went out to the Earthway site to order a spare set of 'plastic' bushings and bearings (see above) and the total cost including S&H came to $20.62, or 13% of the cost of an entirely new unit.  That's just ridiculous.  So when these pieces wear out, I'll create my own bushing/bearing combo from hardwood, and which will outlive me.

Update #2: I purchase the Scotts 15K bags of fertilizer, as do a lot of people, not to mention there are other brands in the same size.  However, only ~90% of fertilizer fits into the hopper at one time.  So, you have to broadcast some of the fertilizer and then dump in the remainder.  It's both a poor design and an annoyance.  I mean, how could Earthway not have realized this and made the hopper a measely 1"" deeper ?  I'm close to downgrading my rating to 3 stars ..."
5.0,"The less expensive spreaders are very tempting to buy especially when you consider how often you actually use them, but in the end, you'll be much happier you went with this one! It's a rugidly built spreader and the larger tires seem to smooth out the rougher areas in my yard. The adjustable height handle easily allows you to get it to a comfortable position. It does require some time to assemble but not a big deal in my opinion! The one thing I would do to make it better would be to replace the hex nuts on the flow adjustment rod with nylock style, self-locking nuts instead. The hex nuts by themselves tend to loosen up over time which requires stopping and re-adjusting (kind of a pain)! I'm sure it will last me many years and probably be the last spreader I'll need to buy!"
5.0,Wonderful broadcast spreader.  I sprayed mine with automotive undercoat and let it fully dry before i assembled it and it lasts years longer.  Even washing it off after use won't stop chemical erosion from fertilizer but the undercoat really helps to slow it down.  Had 4 of these so far and never a problem.  I would get the rain cover if you use it in a business as I do. One fifty pound bag fits in the hopper.
5.0,I bought this to replace my old Scott spreader. By far this is the best for the price I pay for( cheapest at Amazon). The big wheels make it very easy to push.
5.0,"As most folks with a big yard and unsatisfied by the ""big box store"" solutions for broadcast fertilizer spreading stocked by Scotts and other major players, I sought to see if there was anything out there that would solve my problem.  My problem...a 5800 square foot backyard with thick grass and the desire to not spend hours or too much sweat fertilizing and more time on enjoying the yard.

Just to keep it short, after assembling the spreader, it performed flawlessly and easily spreading two 50 lb bags (filling and spreading one at a time) within 20 minutes.  I am very pleased with this product and should last a long time.

Oh, by the way, I washed it off well, just with water, afterward since fertilizer is very corrosive and damaging to the intricate gearing, etc... even when it is sealed as well as on this unit.  This is recommended by the manual anyways."
4.0,"I bought this spreader after having studied reviews of other spreaders out there. Let me start by saying that I am happy with the spreader. It is very easy to drive around and the open/close function is very easy to use. One negative are the horrible assembly instructions - it took me two and half hours to put it together. A smaller negative is the spreading function itself - if the product you are spreading is finely granulated its difficult to get the last part spread - it collects at the bottom and you have to shake the spreader while you are moving along.
Altogether a good spreader and I can recommend it."
5.0,"I bought this spreader with the intention of getting away from 1-2 year throw away box store types. All previous reviews show assembly time around 1-2 hours and this is accurate (this was also with my 4yr old helping me).

1. This is a solid device built with common fastners that will run you under a $1 to replace.
The circular hopper holds a 40lb bag of grass seed comfortably. Inflated tires give thus unit great traction and have no issues negotiating raw fresh ground to lay materials on.

2.  The unit disperses product well. It handled everything from grass seed to calcium to iron mix with ease. The only thing I found difficulty with was a pelletized paper (looks like rabbit food) which ultimately I dispersed manually. The 1/4-1/2"" long pellets would log jam the dropper opening.
Either wheel did a fantastic job of maintaining the rotary mechanism motion which eliminated a common issue I always seemed to have with the $40 spreafers. Dispersion was even and consistant.

3.  Documentation was good and translated well for figuring drop rates.

What I would recommend to the manufacturer would be to print the drop rate schedule right on the bucket for ease if use so that you didn't have to have that paper on you.

While at the time of this review I only had the unit <2 months I am very happy with my purchase and would strongly recommend it to anyone else."

5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,Great deal.. Does the job.
5.0,great deal
5.0,Not much to it.  Sticks in the ground easily or has the option to screw into the fence or deck.
3.0,"The numbers are somewhat small and they are very difficult to read unless you are holding it.  I will continue to use this one, but will look for one with large black markings for next time."
5.0,"Good rain gauge, holds up against most weather elements. We had some fairly large hail crack our previous one. Good price for the value."
4.0,Appears  to be well made.  I hope the plastic spike holds up when located in hard soil.
5.0,"THIS IS A FIRST CLASS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FOR YARD WORK AND IT IS BUILT TO LAST. I USED IT THIS WEEK, AND THE SPREADING WAS UNIFORM ACROSS THE YARD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SPREADER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO MAINTAIN A GREAT YARD.

1.0,"Anyone not mechanically inclined should be careful before buying this spreader.  The assembly instructions are garbage.  Half of the parts don't match up with the instructions, the best picture of the fully assembled product is on this website, and if you really NEED the instructions you're going to be very frustrated with the lack of critical detail.  I had to take the whole thing apart and re-assemble it without the instructions to get it to work properly.  It spent a couple of hours in the garbage can in the meantime before I decided to start over."
4.0,"I received a box of parts that took about 1-1 1/2 hours to assemble.  I rate the instructions as fair-poor with errors in the part numbers and poor numbering of parts.  As an engineer, if I sent a customer these documents, I would have been ashamed of my work.  Once assembled, this is a commercial quality unit that should last a lifetime with a 5 year warranty and very smooth operation!  This quality of a machine is what MADE IN USA is all about!!  If Earthway were to correct their assembly documents, than this would appeal to a larger market than we advanced do-it-yourselfers."
5.0,"This spreader is well designed and made of good materials. It is about three times the cost of those cheap china made spreaders, but to me it is well worth it. It has big tires (yes, real rubber tires) that make it easy to push across the lawn. It has a long adjustable handle that is great for tall people.  Spreading is accurate and even (just make sure the fertilizer or whatever you are spreading is broken down and not in large chunks). This spreader is three times the cost of cheap-o spreaders, but I think it is 10 times better without even considering the fact that it is made in USA. With that considered it is 100 times better."
5.0,"Bought the spreader early Feb. 2012. It arrived on schedule and I put it together only to find a flat tire right out of the box (tubeless) . I called Earthway customer service and they sent a replacement tire and wheel for free. They did not want the old tire back. I would have mailed it to them if they wanted it. I used the spreader to put down pellitized lime and it works great. Much easier to push than my old green spreader. I think this will get a lot of use this season since I will be trying to improve my lawn this season. I also have the 2170 tow model to use for the flat areas, but you need a push model to get around bushes, trees, fences, etc. This is a great spreader for the money. You can spend more, but for home use this is all you really need. Earthway has a video to help with the assembly if you need some extra help putting it together. Earthway rocks.

UPDATE - Oct 2012 - Went to put down fall fertilizer and found tire was flat again. It would not hold air. I bought Fix A Flat can and filled tire with the foam. It fixed the leak right away. Will be using again in March 2013 for Spring so will advise if any more issues."
5.0,"I've had three green spreaders in my life - two that broke and one I just bought.  Having 2nd thoughts about the quality of the new green one, I decided to do a little research on spreaders.  After seeing the Earthway line, I was curious and decided to order one.  Honestly, I picked this particular model because it was the coolest looking one, and the pneumatic tires just seemed like a good idea.

The unit came packaged in a very sturdy box.  Still somehow, the big brown truck managed to wind up with 6"" of the axle sticking straight out of the box.  However, upon inspection, nothing was damaged.

It really does take 1.5 to 2 hours to assemble.  The weakest part of the spreader is the assembly instructions.  Earthway would do well to fire their technical writer and hire a decent one.  The spreader isn't a complicated piece of machinery and with a proper assembly guide, it should take less than 1 hour to put together.

After assembly, I put the unit straight to work planting grass seed and putting out fertilizer.  I've never driven a luxury sports car, but this is, in some way I imagine, the way it feels.  :)  The spreader handles with ease and corners like a dream.  It is sturdy and although I've only used it once, I can't imagine this thing not lasting many, many years.

Some owners have complained about a proper guide on spreader settings.  I don't know if Earthway has improved their documentation in this area over time, but I can say that mine came with a very nice matrix explaining exactly the right settings.  I had called Earthway prior to receipt to ask them what ""green"" numbers to use on the spreader.  The young lady on the phone was very friendly and assured me the included matrix (also available on their website) would explain it all.  She also gave me her extension and asked that I call back if it wasn't clear.  Once I received the matrix, I felt a little silly about the call.  If this issue is one that is making you think twice about the purchase, it really is a non issue.

Expensive for a spreader?  When compared on price alone to the big box ones, yes.  Expensive for a tool that you use only a very few times per year?  Maybe.  But having one in hand, I don't regret a single dollar of the expense.

To borrow a phrase from another advertiser - Earthway puts the ""yee-haw"" back in spreading."
4.0,"I found it to be a bit pricey but the simple fact thats manufactured in the USA makes up for it. We must keep manufacturing here @ home not china.  The spreader works better then the ones sold in the big box stores ( HD,LOWES,WM ETC.) I fertilized my yard in half the time, the spread is smooth and consistent. I would recommend it if your yard is of a larger size then your typical 75x100 lot."
4.0,"This is a great piece of equipment, well made and made in USA which for me means a lot. I use it with a ZTR mower and is a little hard to reach the handle to open the chute but I can live with it. Time will tell if the gear housing holds up as I have had lesser expensive models and one that was more expensive and the gears did not hold up. One of them stripped and the other one corroded very badly."
5.0,"I recently tried out my new Earthway 2150 spreader for the first time, spreading pelletized lime over my lawn.  I was very pleased with the spreader.  The work went much faster than ever before."
5.0,Works very well.  I am well pleased with the unit. The strainer mesh on the top is nice for breaking up any and all chunks of fertilizer.
3.0,"I bought two of these hoses to assist needs on the front side of my property. I purchased a Liberty hose reel (awesome) which holds both of these hoses. They are under pressure 24/7 and haven't bulged, distorted or weakened in any way. I will likely buy two more when my back property hoses decline. This is a good purchase. I gave it 3 stars because one of the two hoses does have a leak. It's at the terminal end which is crimped at the factory. A small leak, maybe a drip every 30seconds. I had printed out a defective/return label to trade it for another, but my father died the next day and missing deadline for return was just one of those things that ""fell through the cracks."" That's my fault and has nothing to do with the company."
5.0,I have purchased several of these hoses in various lengths. All of them have been very good durable hoses.
5.0,"So far the best hose I have ever owned as a balance of weight, strength, non-kinking, and cost.  Cost is somewhat higher than no-name or even some other name brand hose, but considering this actually seems to work without any frustrating hose issues (so far) it is worth the couple of extra dollars for something that does what you expect it too."
5.0,Great for pressure washing!
5.0,Love this hose. I require 150 ft. for my watering needs and this is perfect because it's not too heavy to drag around. Doesn't kink easily and fittings are top notch. Very happy!
5.0,I have purchased Flexogen hoses in the past and they have always been a good choice.  They have a wonderful warranty -- save your paperwork in case you need to have them honor the warranty.  They want you to cut off the 2 ends and return to them and they replace the hose free of charge.  I have had a couple of these hoses for over 10 years.
4.0,Like it. Using as an extension to the 100ft hose. Bit heavy.
5.0,"Tough hose, doesn't easily kink. Exposure to sun after 2 years hasn't affected another one I had before. It might not be the lightest one on the market, but it's a simple good hose. Well worth paying a little more for."
5.0,Great hose!
3.0,"I bought this because it was a Gilmour product and I have bought several of their products and been very satisfied - plus they have a lifetime warranty (they've replaced a sprinkler and spray nozzle without any fuss). However, this Super Duty hose is very flimsy and has not straightened out from shipping. I could have bought a much more heavy duty hose at a local home  improvement store for about nine more dollars. On the plus side, the couplings are very well made and should last a long time. My concern is that I am going to have to take them up on their guarantee several times and with the way companies merge these days, I'm not sure there will always be a Gilmour to stand behind their warranty - they've already been bought by Fiskers."
5.0,"We bought this spreader after seeing it in a local Agway for $320.

It is very high quality.  For example the axle has an inner (rotating) and outer (stationary, on fork) plastic bushings, with a large 3/4"" dia running surface.

The spreader throws quite far, and evenly.  The drop rate is quite adjustable, and there are clear directions for setting the spreader drop opening, based on coverage rate (versus a meaningless ""#8"" on a Scotts spreader).

The pneumatic wheels are larger in dia and roll much more smoothly than a typical plastic-wheeled spreader.

I did a winter fertilizer spreading on my 2 acre lawn in about 45 min., walking briskly.  The spread width was about 6 ft.

A note - Some reviewers said the handle was too short.  There are two sets of holes to use when assembling the handle, either works with the drop adjustment lever and shaft.  I put it together such that it had a longer handle.  I am about 5'10"".  The handle was more than long enough for me, and I could probably have used the other holes, which would make it about 2"" shorter.

Great spreader!"
5.0,"This is a great spreader.  Very well built.  The big tires make it extremely easy to use.
The plastic tub is a plus with only one small metal clip spreader inside which is a real plus
for being nearly corrosive proof. Well worth the investment."
5.0,"Nice well built, Does take awhile to set up so don't do it if your in a hurry. took me about a 6 pack and a football game for assembly in garage. This one will last me at least 20 years plus. Glad I bought this guy!!!"
5.0,"Quality construction and functions as advertised.  Easy to clean.  Assembly takes 1.5 to 2.0 hours and could be improved by simply putting hardware reference drawings on same page as bill of materials for easier identification.  Earthway should consider a You Tube online video for assembly reference.  All told, the spreader is built to last and avoid corrosion, well worth the money.  Amazon offers a good price and free delivery.  Likely the last spreader you'll ever need."
5.0,"I've tried many, this one is top shelf.  More expensive than most but will probably be the last one you'll ever buy."
5.0,"Got the spreader quickly, followed assembley instructions closely and had no problems at all. One of the reviews on here indicated the instuctions were off and to asseble loose with cotter pins closed. This ""advice"" actually slowed me down. Had I ignored the bad info and stuck to the instructions, I would have completed the assembly quicker.  However, if you are in too big of hurry you will not enjoy the assembly at all.  I was the kid that did the model airplanes when it was too wet and rainy to play outside. Assembly is actually fun to me.  Expecially when the steps were written in China or India..even more challenging.  You can save yourself $2,000 bucks a year with a good spread and a good Honda mower.  My yard looks like carpet now !!!

Keep up the good work.  Made in USA !!!"
5.0,"Well, just recieved my earthway 2150.. from the reviews it was a pain in the butt to put together
I only hope it will last as long as my old Lesco spreader.. it lasted 22 years to replace it, the cost was to hight at $426 so went with earthyway ... Will write a new  review in Sept after I use  it for the fall...."
4.0,This is a quality spreader but its a 2 hour process to put this thing together. Two bandaids plus some aggravation and it was done. This product would have gotten 5 stars from me if they had just partially assembled it and put it into a slightly larger box.
5.0,"Great spreader, was exactly what I had been looking for. Big tires make for a lot easier pushing, regulator controls are solid and very accurate, and 50 lbs is all I want to push around anyway, great spreader"
4.0,"Did not get the 5 stars because:
-the assembly instructions were not straightforward.
-there is no mechanism that automatically shuts the opening when you stop: the material keeps falling on the ground, especially when spreading heavily (e.g. lime) unless you close the opening yourself before you stop.
-this spreader is not listed in the packages of what you need to spread, so it takes trial and error to figure out the right opening for the appropriate rate."
5.0,"A great hose for the money.  I live in the country and use hoses a lot.  This one is well made, rugged, and does not kink like some others."
5.0,Great hose. More durable than hoses sold at the local hardware store. Has been pulled and dragged all summer and still works perfectly!
4.0,too much
5.0,"Very good, I use it together with a timer to fill my fountain"
5.0,"I love this hose.  It is not the HEAVY, hard-to-handle hose like I am used to.  I have had it most of the summer, and I have found it to be lightweight, durable and easy to wind up.  I love it!  I have seen pictures of places where this hose bulged.  I can only assume that if you leave a nozzle on the end (that restricts the flow of water) for a long time, it might not hold up.  But, if you turn the water off at the faucet after using, it should hold up for years.  I will probably order another one!"
5.0,"Seems like Gilmour has been slowly diminishing the quality of their Flexogen line; they're not as kink-proof as they used to be.  Still better than all the others in the category (can't speak to the things that cost double and triple the price, as I don't feel like shucking out close to $100 to see if it makes a difference).  I'll be buying more of these, since I have a lot of yard to get around, and this continues to be my first choice of hose.  It will kink, but it is, as its name suggests, very flexible, and never feels like I'm trying to wrestle a python when it's time to coil it back up.  I also like the neutral grey color; it doesn't stand out on the crushed gravel and flagstone walks surrounding planted areas and the driveway."
5.0,"Great hose and it works great, my last 3 hoses burst. This one is well made and is holding up very well."
5.0,"These are excellent hoses, but what's even better is the lifetime warranty.  I have 5 of these, and each one has been replaced at least once (after a number of years of use).  Excellent customer service.  You used to have to cut off the ends and send them in for a replacement.  Now you take a picture and file the warranty claim online."
5.0,"It is sturdy, does not kink and has great pressure. It does exactly as promised."
5.0,Great hoses made in USA
5.0,"I just put this beast together.  For some reason I only read a few reviews and one of them was of somebody saying that the unit came fully assembled right out of the box.  Couple that with a 5-star ranking from over 50 reviews and you have a no-brainer right?  Well my spreader didn't come assembled and let me tell you, the big red beast was a BEAST to assemble.  I'm a guy in his 30s and it took me about 90 minutes to do it.  If you aren't mechanically inclined you might have a little trouble but let me tell you it's worth it!  This thing looks awesome.  I haven't even used it yet and I can just tell it's going to kick some serious weed butt.  The tires look like those from a 67 chevy; big enough to roll over anything.  I can't wait to get this puppy out there while my neighbors are breaking their backs leaning over with those cheap scotts spreaders.  If anybody asks to borrow it I'm telling them ""No you go get your own big red!"""
1.0,"Not worth the price.
impossible to assemble, without calling the help line,, on hold.
Not sure how this got 50, 5 star's
Look for something else...."
4.0,"I used my spreader last weekend to apply fertilizer/weed killer.

THE GOOD: This spreader is very well designed and highly stable. Unlike the biggest competitor's machine, it never tipped and never stalled. The cylindrical drum centered over a wider axle and the rubber tires work well. On a new lawn still with holes and coughing up rocks, stability was invaluable. The screen helps break up lumps in the product. The spreader distributes product evenly and its mechanisms all operate smoothly. I am confused by the ""50 pound"" nomenclature; of this product, at least, only about 20 lbs fit in the hopper at one time. The chart that comes with the machine makes it easy to apply any product if you know the weight of the bag and its designed coverage.

THE BAD: I received a box from Equipment2U that contained a haphazard jumble of parts, not an orderly packing. I suspect I received a product that had been returned and resold without inspection. I was shorted two bolts, but easily replaced these. Beware of this vendor. But that is not Earthway's fault, and not what cost them a star.

What cost them a star was the absolutely horrendous assembly instructions. They were poorly written and drawn, lacking important features like ""bolt lines"" that show how things fit together. Some folks have stated that their spreaders arrived assembled; mine did not. If yours does not, expect some frustration on your way to a good product (I am an engineer and reasonably good mechanically; I have assembled numerous products without incident or failure).

USAGE NOTES: The instructions claim that you cannot apply products like de-icer with this spreader, but there are some contradictory stickers on the machine that suggest you can. If this is one of your intended uses, I recommend calling Earthway to clarify that. You also cannot apply powders, like lime, as these will eventually foul the gearbox. You can apply any granular product or seed product. A chart helps you estimate the ""throw"" based on the particle size."
5.0,"I can't count the number of spreaders I've had over the years.  They all were purchases from a local home improvement store, and probably ranged in cost from $40-$80.  The vast majority of them were returned within the first week for one reason or another, and the rest never made it through a season.  Maybe I'm just harder on them than average... but I have come to think of all these type of spreaders as ""disposable"".  I finally coughed up the price of an Earthway (I bought the 2150).  It cost three times the average of those at the big box stores, but I think the investment was worth it.  This thing is tough.  I haven't been able to put enough material in it to make it flex, it hasn't clogged up once, and the spreading pattern is really easy to adjust and maintain.  I can see where some people may be put off by the assembly, though.  The instructions are perfectly accurate, but you really have to follow them closely or you end up taking something apart and redoing it.  For anyone who is even slightly mechanically minded, though, assembly is not a big deal.

This spreader is a keeper, and easy to recommend."
5.0,"Assembly was time consuming.  I'm adept at mechanical things and it took me about 2 1/2 hours.  Lots of parts and the directions were sketchy.  Once assembled, the spreader works just fine."
4.0,This spreader is by far better than any other spreader I've ever used.  They advertise it as a commercial spreader and I was a little disappointed that it was not better than it is.  But it is OK.  It took me about 45 minutes to put it together.  It is easy to push on hills and handles a 50 pound bag of fertilizer with no problems.  Unless you want to spend $400 I don't think you will find a better spreader.
5.0,"This thing is far better than expected, it makes Scotts spreader look like a toy. I cannot wait to try it out."
4.0,"I had done a lot of research on spreaders for my 1 acre lawn.  I wanted something that would last a while and that could handle heavy use and hilly terrain.  Large pneumatic tires, a positive force chute opening and closing mechanism (not a cable inside of a rubber housing), and something tall enough for my 6'3"" frame were all important to me.  It's still winter so I have not used it yet, but so far it looks as thought the Earthway 2150 will fit the bill.

Shipping was extra fast.  Received the contents snugly packed in a nice small box (small compared to the assembled size of the spreader).  Took about an hour to assemble.  This thing is a monster.  Solidly built.  My one gripe is that I wish the hopper was a bit bigger.  For such a big frame, it seems as though this spreader could have handled an 80 lb hopper quite easily.  Oh well.  I'm pretty sure it can handle a bag of Milorganite or a 10,000 sq ft bag of fertilizer at a time."
4.0,"This is a well made spreader at should last for many years.  The instructions were not as clear as I would have liked but I was able to get it together on the first try in under 60 minutes.  The instruction says to empty & clean each time (really,, who's going to do that).  If a little moisture causes caking of your material then it is a little difficult to poke a small stick in from the top to stir things up a little."
5.0,"I'm not sure what all of the complaints were about how long this spreader takes to put together, but i had it completed in about 45 minutes. The directions were easily understandable and it went together like a charm. This spreader is much better than the last two Shindawa commercial spreaders that i owned. The 50-pound capacity is perfect because if you get any more product than that in a push spreader it makes it very difficult to push. I would highly recommmend this spreader."
5.0,"The Earthway 2150 was bigger than I envisioned, but very sturdy and I could tell right away that it was QUALITY.  My husband was getting really tired of having cheap spreaders that would last 1 season long - this one will last for a LONG LONG time. It took him a little over an hour to assemble it and we used it right away.  We did have one problem with it during its first use - the nut that holds the bar for the hopper adjustment came loose while running it over rough terrain.  Once that was replaced with a lock nut we haven't had any problems. I love the wide spead that it has - took fewer trips back and forth and I really like the the gauge for stopping and starting - it works like a charm.  Granted, it was what I would call ""expensive"" - but overall it will outlast any Scotts spreader that you could buy at the box stores.  I am a very happy customer."
5.0,I was in need of a quality spreader and researched many. Got tired of the other kinds that you would normally buy at your local store only to get a piece of junk and find it at the curb for trash pick-up. I decided on this unit. Earthway makes a quality product. Opened it up and assembled it in about 45 minutes. Not too bad. Instructions were clear and picture illustrations a bit schetchy at times but none-the-less it worked out. Very satisfied! I would definitely recommend this spreader. Just be handy with tools and patience with the instructions and you should have it together without complications. Only wish that it came with a hopper cover. This is an option to purchase should you need it.
5.0,"Really got tired of buying $50 Scotts (junk)spreaders every other year, just to send them to the landfill.

So doing the Math is easy.  Yes, this unit cost $160, but it will probably be handed down to my Son after I pass.  --kind of a duh moment--.

Hint on Assembly...no busted knuckles, and save the beer for the after-celebration!
Scan the assembly instructions thoroughly before starting the assembly (I did not, and had to redo several steps).  Look at the illustrations carefully...they are quite accurate...if you just look at them carefully!

Unless you are 6'5"" or taller, do not set up the handle for the extended reach!!!
That will be another redo.... trust me!

If this thing spreads half as good as it feels after assembly... I'm a really, happy camper!  Thanks Earthway!"
5.0,I could not be happier with this broadcast spreader.  Assembly was pretty easy and the large air-filled tires make pushing it a breeze.  Time to throw away the old green spreader!
5.0,"This is a great spreader,  well built and should be durable BUT the instructions leave a lot to be desired,  a couple of steps were omitted and it was impossible
to insert the handle spacer into the square shaft,  it was too big.  Also putting
the wheels on the axle posed a problem,  when you inserted the axle bushings the
hole in the axle was not accessable.  A call to EarthWay was no help.  They put us on hold,  we got a message asking us to leave a number for a call back,  but no one ever returned our call. Luckily we were resourceful. The only way to solve it was with brute force.  Sitting the spreader on it's side,  with my husband pushed down on the wheels while I inserted the cotter pin.  As other reviewers has said
count on a couple of hours to put it together and some ingenuity.  Good luck."
5.0,"i bought this spreader because i am getting into the fertilizing and seeding business. this works great. heavy built, big wheels,pvc rims are great, and holds lots of fertilizer. it took a little while to build due to all of the parts but i got it put together and so far it has been doing great. (close the valve when filling it up or everything goes right through and on the ground.i accidentally did that a couple of times) haha"
5.0,"The Earthway 2150 is a prosumer product. The construction is very rugged and the fit and finish are excellent. I can see it lasting for many years. This is not the toys you see at the home improvement and hardware stores.

The only caution I offer is that it comes completely disassembled. The instructions are good, but if you're not comfortable putting things together, I wouldn't recommend buying this spreader. I consider myself very handy and it took me 1-1/2 hours to put this together."
5.0,"The Earthway 2150 appears to be well designed and well constructed. The screen in the top of the hopper prevents clumps of material from getting to the stirrer at the bottom. Multiple slots in the bottom further minimize clogging. The pneumatic wheels, despite their plastic hubs, are so much better than the molded plastic ones used on cheaper units. I'm on the tall side so the adjustable handle eliminates backaches caused by having to bend over to push the spreader. The hopper holds a 40 pound bag of Ironite easily so I believe the 50 pound capacity claim is reasonable.

ASSEMBLY: The instructions are fairly good -- I only found one area that was a bit confusing. The one ding I would give them is the absence of a required tools list. As other reviewers have pointed out, figuring out which of the multitude of similar length bolts to use in each step is a bit challenging -- having a 6"" rule handy is helpful. I completed the assembly in about an hour, but admit having an engineering background was an advantage. The application adjustment uses a plastic/metal wing nut which had one of the ears broken off on arrival -- I need to call and request a replacement.

Earthway provides a very useful ""cheat sheet"" that provides the information you need to determine the spreader setting based on coverage information on the fertilizer bag. Do pay attention to the coverage width information especially if you are applying something with a larger grain size like Ironite -- I learned this the expensive way.

The Earthway 2150 is more expensive than some, but as the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."" And it is Made in America.

Highly recommended."
5.0,We have had spreaders in the past and they are weak and don't last.  This one is strong and very easy to use.  Even our friend who is a landscaper wanted to know where we purchased so he could order some.
5.0,"I read the many posts here before purchasing ... I ordered Friday afternoon, chose the 1-day ship for $3.99, and it was at my home in less than 24 hours, and I'm 50 miles from DFW airport ... wow!

I bought the product because of the great reviews and because it is made in America (Indiana, to be exact). I looked at Lesco - made in China - and Lesco costs an extra $65.

Set up takes about 90 minutes ... it goes by quickly ... just follow the steps and pay attention. One note: I am 5' 9"" and went with the lowest setting for the handles and it's perfect. I tried medium but it was too tall for my comfort. Maybe if I were 6' it would be o.k.

I also recommend using Loctite on the threads and nuts, either red or blue, though I used red since I don't plan to take it apart anytime soon (ever).

I will look to buy more from EarthWay. Why? Because they are Made in USA (and at high quality) ... I'm done buying cheap Chinese products (i.e., Scotts, Lesco, all the other big-brand names that outsource American jobs.

Good luck ..."
3.0,This spreader is well built and the large drive wheels make it a breeze to push.  The only disappointment I have is the inconsistent pattern of the spreading.  I expected better.
5.0,"After much searching and buying two other less expensive broadcast spreaders, I finally broke down and bought this one and glad I did. Pricey but worth it. Works well and I am glad now that I spent the extra money and bought it."
5.0,"I HAVE OWNED OTHER BRANDS OF FERTILIZER SPREADERS.SOME WERE GOOD AND OTHERS NOT SO GOOD.BUT,THIS EARTHWAY 2150 COMMERCIAL WALK-BEHIND IS BYYYY FAR MY PERSONAL BEST.WELL BUILT AND STURDY,SOMEWHAT RUGGED.OH!YES I DEFINELTY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FERTLIZER SPREADER."
5.0,"This is an outstanding product.  It has heft, wheels don't slip EVER, well built and easy to assemble if you carefully read and follow the directions.  If you have at it without following the instructions you will pull your hair out.  I recommend this spreader very highly."
5.0,"I read reviews on all the commercial grade spreaders and chose the Earthway 2150.  The plastic wheeled Scotts spreaders work OK but they just do not last very long.  You can pay $400 or $500 for a commercial spreader which is quite high for the average homeowner.  I paid $180 for the Earthway 2150 and consider it a great value.  It has a heavy duty frame and large pneumatic tires which are the major selling points, at least to me.  It rolls easily over an uneven yard such as mine and spreads evenly.  I needed to open the setting a little more for grass seed than what was recommended to keep from clogging with ""larger"" seeds such as fescue.  This is a great spreader for the average user and it appears it will last for many years."
2.0,"I purchased my 2150 spreader last fall and used it once to spread pelletized fall fertilizer on my half acre lawn, washed it out immediately afterwards and then stored it insisde my garage over the winter. I used it again in early April to spread pelletized lime, washed it again and stored it indoors. Two weeks later I used it to spread spring pelletized fertilizer only to have the gearbox completely jam-up on me. Beware of the 90 day warranty, I guess!"
5.0,"***** Spreads really well, uphill, sidehill, downhill. Even though there is no edge guard like a scotts, I found I really do not miss it.
***** Easy to push. The pneumatic tires are really good. I found that I get the job done a lit faster now.
***** The disperion rate adjuster knob may look primitive, but it really works well and the feed on/off lever is really smooth.
***** The hopper grate is really a nice feature I have never had on my previous spreaders. It catches clots where you can grab them and crush them.
***** Well made, looks like it will hold up. I bent my scotts spreader frame simply because it was poorly engineered and the little plastic wheels don't exit bumps well.
**  Assembly is complex. Easy enough for me, I didn't mind it, but I imagine some folks would have a tough time with it.
*  Expensive. I shouldn't have to pay this much for a walk behind spreader. I can't deduct stars on the rating for this, because I knew what it cost when I bought it.

Edit: Years later, I have had problems with the valve actuator level. The rods didn't push the valve plate in plane, so they caused the valve plate to flex. I got some metal rods and an aluminum bracket to change the geometry of the rods so they did not flex the valve plate. Now it works better than new. It is better quality than the other spreaders I have used, and still does a decent job. I still like it even though I had to fix it. I have to wash it and keep it in the shed so it doesn't rust too quickly."
5.0,"With so many reviewers giving this product 5 stars, I didn't want to spoil the good run by giving less than 5 stars.  However, there are some reservations that you should consider.  Since these detractors may apply to many brands of fertilizer applicators, it wouldn't be fair to assign blame only to this one model.

At mentioned in previous reviews, assembly requires diligence.  I am very mechanically inclined and did read and note all the prior assembly tips given by other reviewers.  I recommend you do the same.  I very carefully read and studied the assembly papers before putting this item together.  I thought that surely it would not take me 2 hours to assemble this given my experience, but it did take 2 hours 10 minutes.  As careful as I was, about 10 minutes into the assembly, I discovered that I had bolted the main frame to the plastic hopper upside down.  The assembly directions do have drawings but they are not nearly as good as photographs would have been.  If you don't feel you are good at following detailed instructions, either have a friend help you or find another brand that has better assembly directions or is already assembled.

That said, now for comments on the completed unit.  In past 14 years I have purchased several models of drop spreaders and rotary spreaders in my attempt to apply fertilizer uniformly and without having to have an ambulance standing by for resuscitation due to difficulty in pushing the spreaders.  I have around 1/2 acre of grass.  Front yard is about 60% of that total and is on a grade of around 7%.  Doesn't sound like much of a hill but when you are trying to push 40 pounds of fertilizer and spreader up hill, believe me, it is a lot.  My last spreaders were Scott's best drop spreader and rotary spreader.  The drop spreader theoretically could apply fertilizer more uniformly but suffers from 2 drawbacks: 1) the bottom holes and adjustable closer are plastic and subject to slight warping. With the very small holes, only a slight warping will cause fertilizer to fall faster out of some holes and slower out of others.  The result is banding (or striping) in the lawn.  Being careful to follow the wheel markings in the grass doesn't stop this banding since it occurs due to the adjustable closer misalignment. 2) the holes are rather close to the ground and any blade of grass that touches the undercarriage will deposit its dew onto the holes which will eventually cause the fertilizer to stick to the hole and not drop out.  This essentially disables the drop spreader until it is thoroughly dried out.  Applying the fertilizer in the afternoon when the dew is gone would seem like a good idea if you like heat stroke.

The Scott's rotary spreader is very difficult to push uphill.  I think this is likely because of the plastic wheels just do not roll smoothly.  Inherent disadvantage of a rotary spreader is that it will send the fertilizer out further when you are going down hill than uphill because you are traveling slower uphill and the impeller is rotating more slowly and throwing less of the fertilizer.

Now for the Earthway 2150.  Once assembled, the first thing I noticed was that it had 3 holes, not just 1, in the bottom of the hopper so that fertilizer dropped into the impeller more uniformly.  The impeller seemed to rotate faster for the same forward speed.  This would mean that when I am going slower uphill, it is still throwing fertilizer quite a distance (compared to the Scott's).  The pneumatic tires are tremendously easier to push up hill and even allowed me to travel faster than I could with the Scott's with the possible result that uniform application of the fertilizer will have improved.

It has been 8 days since I have applied the Spring fertilizer with Crabgrass preventer.  Usually, by 8 days in past years, I can already see the striping (with Scott's spreaders).  We have had rain the day I applied the fertilizer, so, it did get activated.  I am not seeing striping. I must admit, I expected to see it even with the Earthway 2150 but I am not.  I'll have to wait to end of July to see if Crabgrass is present.  If I didn't get the fertilizer on uniformly, I will have lots of Crabgrass.  We'll have to wait for that.

One comment on the adjuster used to determine how much fertilizer is going to fall to the impeller and be applied to your lawn.  The setting is based upon the weight of your fertilizer package and the square footage it is supposed to cover according to the bag claim.  I found that the adjuster is really more of a wild guess than anything scientific.  Although I calculated the setting in accordance to the Earthway manual, the first 3 passes I made in the front lawn used 1/2 bag of 15,000 square feet of fertilizer.  Obviously, this was grossly too much.  I made successive reductions in the setting as I made successive passes in the lawn.  I ended up with the adjuster set to its minimum.  I feel confident that after a couple more times of fertilizer applications this year, I will have settled into what setting is going to work for my lawn.  Since there are so many particle sizes within different brands of fertilizers, it is virtually impossible to tell ahead of time what is going to work for the adjuster setting.  However, I would caution you that likely it may apply your fertilizer much more heavily than the manufacturer had recommended.  Better have plenty of extra bags of fertilizer handy if you dial in the calculated adjuster setting.  I may have to cut that part of my lawn where the 1/2 bag of fertilizer was applied so heavily twice a week!

It isn't a perfect world for fertilizer spreaders.  If your lawn is flat, this rotary spreader will likely work better than other brands once you have the application adjuster figured out for your fertilizer product and have insured that you didn't bolt the mainframe to the hopper upside down.  If you have a hill as I do, this rotary spreader may be superior to other products also."
5.0,"I purchased this spreader for use on my 2 acre property.  We have some hills and rough spots.  This spreader is overall the best spreader that I could ever want.  I own another spreader that pulls behind my lawn tractor, but for the occasions when you have some expensive seed or other products that you have to spread, I'm not willing to loose $$ by using the pull behind spreader.  This spreader from Earthway is much more precise and puts the product where you want it when you want it.  Here's what makes this spreader the best one that I've ever purchased and used: It's got big 13 inch pneumatic wheels which let it glide over all the rough spots in the yard or the occasional sticks.  The hopper is 50 lbs and is actually plenty heavy when loaded and you have to go up hill.  The spread of the broadcast is right on target.  It doesn't sent it back on your legs just pretty much out front.  The on/off is a real steel shaft and not a rinky dink little cable in a sheaf.  This is real on/off control.  No kidding around.  The kit comes in a rugged cardboard box and assembles kind of slow, but what the heck, you only have to do it once.  Hands down, this is the best broadcast spreader that you could ever find for the $$.  Guaranteed you will never ever ever have to buy another walk behind spreader for the rest of your life, unless you run over it with the car or burn it up.  I have no doubt that you will really like this machine."
5.0,Great piece of equipment.  Assembly instructions weren't too bad. I'd buy again but I don't think I will ever need to buy another one.
4.0,"took too long to get, but was what I expected"
5.0,Always good stuff from Gilmore; but wish I would have got the 3/4 inch.
5.0,"These hoses really seem to not kink - fast shipping, good price, good quality.  I'm happy!"
5.0,It is easy to roll up and has plenty of water to come thru
4.0,"This is a nice flexible and light-weight hose.  It does kink when it is uncoiled after storage, as do all hoses I have owned, but the kinks don't remain once the hose is straightened out based on the flexible construction.  The end connections are of good quality and should be durable.  Good hose, overall."
5.0,Was exactly what my husband wanted. Received promptly.
5.0,Great flexible hose
5.0,Love it.  We live on a farm and we used it when it first came in.  So handy!
5.0,Works great and looks nice.
5.0,Using it daily and seems to be working fine.
5.0,"I bought this for spreadin sand and ice melt in the winter, and fertilizer in the summer. This thing is well built and solid. It spreads nics and doesn't clog easily. The large rubber tires work well for using in the winter (the Scott's spreader I was using would just slide accrosss the ice and not spread)."
5.0,Buy this Earthway Broadcast spreader and most likely it would last you a lifetime. I get into the habit of buying quality products (if I could afford them) and in general they last much longer and much more easier to use. It's a buy
5.0,This spreader is worth every penny. What a difference from the small wheeled Big Box pieces of junk. Handle bars are adjustables so you don't kill your back. Large wheels make pushing on uneven ground a joy. Put the money you save on a lawn service into a quality spreader and you won't be disappointed.
5.0,"If you are tired of the hard to push cheap fertilizer spreaders, then this is the answer you may be looking for. The Earthway 2150's multiple handle height position and large pneumatic tires help to make using this spreader as painless as possible. Assembly was straight forward and should be no problem for anyone with a little mechanical ability. Allow about an hour for assembly and an extra hand would also be helpful. This spreader is built to last and with proper maintenance (always wash out the spreader after use) may be the last you need to buy. I'm very happy with this spreader and would recommend it to anyone."
5.0,"This is the best spreader I have ever used hands down! My yard is uneven, bumpy at times, and slopes downhill in the back yard. I have gone through a couple of Scotts spreaders already that could not handle a few bumps when they would bend and fall apart. The Earthway 2150 handles all the bumps and dips in the yard with ease thanks to the big pneumatic tires which also makes it easy to push when loaded. The spreader comes with a chart to calibrate the setting control lever based on the type of material per 1000sqft. I used a setting of 11 to spread season long bug killer and this thing spreads so much more evenly than the Scotts junk that I owned before that always broke. You will be happy with this one, it will outlast anything that you could find at your local home improvement store."
5.0,"I recently used this spreader to fertilize my 1 acre lawn.  The large tires rolled easily over the rough lawn surface; the fertilize spread evenly, and the unit was easy to push after I adjusted the handle for my height.  The assembly was not too difficult, I took more time to closely review the instructions after reading the previous comments here.  For larger lawns, I would recommend this product over the small rinky dink Scotts spreaders which don't look like they would last long."
5.0,"I've examined the packaging, the printed materials that came with it and the spreader itself and nowhere did I find it mentioned that this was made in this country. Thanks to woeful, printed-instructions, a call to EarthWay not only got me back on track but also confirmed that the spreader was built entirely in Indiana. Plan on two-hours for assembly and follow these missing instructions: 1) Don't fully tighten any bolt until the assembly is otherwise done; 2) The absolute last thing that you do is spread the cotter pins; 3) Put the 1-1/2"" and the 1-3/4"" bolts in separate, well-marked salad bowls; 4) The handle shaft's longer, indented-end faces the spreader hopper (not the handle); and, 6) Grab the band-aids and a beer. My instructions will allow you to finish the assembly a half hour sooner than it would have otherwise. The spreader works fine and Amazon's free-shipping price is a best buy."
5.0,"I just purchased this spreader and have found it to be very sturdy and well built.  It rolls easily over rough terrain and broadcasts evenly.
It is a bit of a pain to assemble, so I would not recommend trying this unless you are handy.  Overall, it is a bargain when compared to what the Big Box stores sell."
5.0,"I purchased an Agri Fab spreader from Sam's which was a piece of junk.  Used it 8 times before it broke.  Borrowed a friend's Earthway (stainless steel model)until I decided what I was going to replace the Agri Fab spreader with. I didn't want to pay a fortune for a spreader but I wanted one that would last.  I called Earthway and the customer service rep recommended the 2150 model.  The 2150 was easy to assemble, calibrate, and easy to use.  I expect to get many years of service from it."
5.0,My husband loves this spreader and loves to work in the yard.  The tires make it easy to go over tough terrain.  We also have a steep back yard and he loved the adjustment capability to direct the fertilizer exactly to the area he wanted.  Much better than the one we bought from the box store and are going to throw away.
4.0,Finally - a hose that really doesn't kink!! A day streatched out in the sun will keep it straight for use.

I purchased this hose in January 2015 and today August 1, 2017 the male end of the hose broke off. This hose has a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. I have contacted Amazon about the warranty. I'm waiting for a response."
4.0,good hose so far. early days but optimistic.
5.0,Great hose so far. Flexible enough but does not kink.
2.0,Hose was perfectly sized.......but already has a rupture (very small) after only two uses.  Dissapointed with that!!!
5.0,High quality hose.
5.0,"Perfect hose for use with the 'pressure stick' attachment.  Got the 20' length, suits my needs just fine!"
5.0,My husband is enjoying this hose! I gave it to him for Father's Day. It reaches the perfect distance for watering his vegetable garden. It is a high quality hose but it will still kink at times. Not as much as the hose he was using though. He is happy with it!
1.0,"I would never buy this hose again,  And even though it appears to be in perfect condition, I will replace it with another product. Even under pressure, it kinks anytime you don't stretch it out its entire length and carefully twist it to its satisfaction.  Coiling it on the hose reel is always difficult because it has its own mind, that has nothing to do with the way it is always stored.  So it is a pain in the butt to deploy, and even a bigger pain to store."
3.0,"sadly so soft it KINKS.... but the color is pleasant and I am assuming when it says it is 600PSI, it is and I will be fine with that."
5.0,"Works just as it should. Tires are large enough to accomodate my rough yard. I've run fertilizer, pelletized lime, and grass seed through it. Sometimes it's difficult to get the grass seed to start flowing, but once it starts it works fine. I think the problem is walking across the yard without spreading - the seed tends to settle in tight. I found that if I rattle or jiggle the spreader just prior to opening the valve, the seed starts out fine. But again, that is only with light grass seed. It works flawlessly with fertilizer. I would not hesitate to buy this spreader again."
5.0,"I have to say that this is the best spreader I have ever used. I have spent money on the best scott's spreaders available and this one has them all beat. I know it's more money, but the smoothness and eveness is the best. I would highly recommand it to anyone wanting to do their own work."
5.0,"If I were designing a broadcast spreader, this is exactly how it would be. I had originally purchased a spreader from Tractor Supply for the same amount of money I paid for this Earthway spreader, and it lasted 30 minutes before the plastic control handle broke. I returned it to the store for a refund and ordered the Earthway from Amazon. It has performed flawlessly and is professionally made. It took approx. (2) hours to assemble and looks like it will last a lifetime. Excellent Product!"
5.0,"One of the best features of this spreader is the removable plastic screen in the bin.  Given the chunks that inevitably show up in fertilizer products it makes spreading significantly more accurate since you know you are not restricting flow with a solid mass of fertilizer covering the outlets that you have just calibrated.  This is only available on the ""commercial"" Earthway spreaders and given past experiences is worth the difference in price.  The spreader is well made but the bin/tub only holds about 10K sq ft. of product.  The 2170 has a larger bin but the smaller tank on the 2150 makes this a very stable unit.  With my lawn conditions, this was worth the trade off.  The solid easily calibrated linkage also appears to be much better than a cable actuated meter.  I have only used it a couple of times but so far it appears to be a well made product."
5.0,"Very well built, easy to push and spreads well.  Assembly instructions aren't great, but if you take your time and pay attention to the detail, it'll be together in 1-2 hours."
5.0,"It took a couple hours to assemble; some of the directions are a little fuzzy, no missing parts, and standard shipping was fast.
It works great! My lawn is pretty bumpy and I had no trouble with it bouncing all over; the large rubber tires make the difference.  I cut back on the flow adjustment for spreading from those suggested that came with it.
Works great, glad I bought it."
5.0,"My husband is very picky and went overboard in complimenting how easy the spreader was to operate and how smoothly it ran.  We have a large lawn and it made his life much easier.  Also, he is very tall and he liked the fact that the handle is long enough to avoid having to bend down and hurt his back to operate!"
5.0,"After using my new Scott's Deluxe Edgeguard spreader once, I returned it for a refund and ordered this spreader. What a huge difference! I'm very happy with this Earthway 2150 spreader and it makes fertilizing the lawn easy and fun. The unit rolls very well, and with it's big pneumatic tires, it easily rolls over my uneven turf. The spreader is built well and I imagine it will last for many years. Assemby was straight forward and went together easily. The spreader comes with a chart for setting the spreader based on the number of pounds to spread per 1000 sq. ft. It does not come with settings for specific brands of fertilizer. The setting control is well calibrated and is easy to adjust. Lastly, the handle can be assembled at different lengths to accomodate different operator heights. This worked great for me, as I am tall and needed the extra handle length to avoid bending forward and causing back pain."
5.0,"Excellent spreader.
It took a while to put together, but it is a very high quality piece."
5.0,I purchased this spreader after yet another less expensive spreader had cracked and split.  I love the pneumatic wheels as I have an extremely steep slope to my back yard and it rolls with so much more ease than the cheaper plastic wheels.  It is also far superior in the quality of the spreading mechanism and did a significantly better job when I fertilized the lawn.  The only negative comment would be that even for my very handy husband this was a little confusing to put together as the directions were mostly diagrams and not well written.  I know that the extra dollars were worth it as this spreader will make it far more than one or two years like the old ones .. so in the end it's actually cheaper. Fast shipping too!!!
2.0,"10 months in, and the hose is developing a ""spiral snake"" in one section.when under pressure (which is not very often, and I NEVER let it sit under pressure for long)  Actually causes the hose to twist up over itself!  When empty, it flattens like a fire hose in that area, the wall is clearly separating inside, so only a matter of time till it weakens and ruptures there.  Will be testing the lifetime warranty promise I guess--why I bought this one in the first place. (Never had a hose do this before, I can send some pix if anyone is interested)"
1.0,"After all the terrific reviews for this hose, I was very disappointed with it. I just got this hose yesterday and immediately set it up, but found that it leaked right away. And not a small, slow drip, but a fast one, losing a lot of water. I put a new rubber washer in hoping it would fix the problem. Nope. I used plumbers tape to see if it would help. Nope. I wound even more plumbers tape around it trying to at least temporarily stop the leak. Nope. The hose is useless out of the box, and just isn't the quality I expected based on the majority of reviews."
3.0,"Not the worst product out there.  It does resist kinking, but it's much less flexible than a proper rubber hose.  Our just failed at just under 3 years."
3.0,ok
5.0,It doesn't leak!
5.0,Everything they said it was going to be. About a month in with no problems and no crimping.
5.0,"Was exactly what I was hoping for, no kinking."
5.0,Good job.
5.0,Flexogen hoses are well built with heavy duty brass fittings.
5.0,"Purchased this hose (in green) exactly 10 years ago and it is still getting the job done. No holes, tears or leaks and it only kinks occasionally when I pull the full 100ft from the reel and drag sections around the corner. I'm pretty sure the kinks are a result of my careless handling. This hose has been outdoors full time for a decade - exposed to extreme temperatures (30s in winter, triple digits during the summer). It is on a portable reel, most of the time and sits in west exposure sun.

I'm picking up a shorter hose today that I can use in the front yard to was my car. Definitely recommend this Gilmore Flexogen...it is a great value."
4.0,It plants seeds in the ground. It did fine for spinach and kale and arugula this spring. Is a bit difficult to use in thick soil but now I have fresh greens to eat.
5.0,Planted radishes worked as planned.
5.0,Well made
4.0,"Fantastic for a home garden.  The only issue is that seed hopper doesn't taper down to the seed plate pickup but is square across the bottom.  What this means is that you'll have a lot of seed left in the hopper and the seed plate can't pick it up.  I find myself shaking it from side to side or tilting at an angle as it's pushed (which screws up the exact planting depth).  If you buy your garden seed in the little packets, it'll be expensive.  However, guess the target users for this have bigger gardens and buy in bulk at garden/farm supply places."
5.0,Excellent in every way
5.0,I stumbled across these reviews while searching for a fertilizer attachment. I have had mine for almost 20 years and my father has had his for as long as I can remember. This is designed to work in tilled dry soil. It is not a no till seeder. There should be no down pressure needed on the front wheel. Take your time and it will work fine. Is it perfect?  No. It will double drop and it will skip and it will get seeds pinched behind the plates from time to time. My rows are 55 feet long. Several corn varieties beans peas carrots. I would rather put up with its little quirks than plant by hand. I highly recommend this planter to any gardener
1.0,"it did not work, it stuck in the ground and did not distribute the seed well"
4.0,"Works pretty good. Soil must be well-worked and free, does not like tough soil or wet soil. Drops too many seeds sometimes, but hey still better than planting by hand."
5.0,"works great, saves time"
5.0,Light weight. Easy assembly
5.0,Best hose I've bought in decades.
1.0,"I purchased this on July 6,2016 and it has exploded in several places.  This is the first time I ever had a hose explode., Gilmour's new design need to test this hose under normal pressure. I left the hose under pressure for about 60 to 90 minutes, the pressure regulator on my house is set for 80 psi.  I have owned hoses that have lasted for more than 10 years.  This garbage couldn't even make past one year.  I want my money back!!  I am replacing this hose with an Apex 5/8"" 75 ft. today from Amazon."
1.0,"This hose arrived very quickly and packaged well.  However, I ordered a 50 ft hose and was sent a 25 ft.  It does not reach all areas that I need to water.  The hose itself does seem a little lighter in weight and pulls out fairly easily.  IF ONLY!!!!"
5.0,top dollar
1.0,"I bought several sections of 50' and 100' sections of this hose due to Gilmour's reputation. Sadly, reputation and reality are two different things. All six bundles of hose were kinked where the male end is hidden by the cardboard packaging.

 I waited for the kink to ease out - after use in warm weather  - but it's still there and the kink still impede's the flow.

 I liked the product for it's ruggedness but this manufacturing/packaging flaw is fatal to customer loyalty.

Additionally, their guarantee is worthless as they never bother writing or calling back."
5.0,"Read the bad reviews, but I've had it for almost 2 years and it hasn't leaked once."

5.0,Item arrived quickly and was of the quality expected.
5.0,"Good hose, thou you do get a little crimping."
1.0,"This is made by Flexgen (Flexogen?), which is the worst hose I've had the misfortune to use.

Don't buy this unless you need to brush up on your curse words.

no stars

This is the most prone-to-kinks hose (I was going to say 'kinkiest hose') I've ever worked with, and I'm 70 years old and seen a lot o' hoses, honey!  Weather 50*, slight breeze, in the shade.  Perfect conditions for strenuous yard work.  I worked an hour trying to get this wound around one of those ""roller"" things mounted on the wall.  Sweat was pouring down me.  I knew I would never get it straightened out enough to get it on the roller.  I quit trying.  I got this at Lowe's, but I wanted to warn you not to buy it.

I got a Flexilla, and it's far better!  Does not kink; honest!  Mine's *100 ft long*, too!  Flexilla is more expensive, granted, but you won't learn any new curse words with it.  mb"
1.0,worse push type seed planter. cannot plant sweet corn seed jams up in the seede tube.
5.0,"waiting for spring to come should help plant faster, straighter rows."
3.0,"Seems like this is only practical for large seed. I was hoping it would save me time planting the small seeds....carrots, lettuce, etc."
1.0,Very disappointed with this seeder. It does not seed evenly and wastes a lot of seed. It smashes arugula seed. The seed plates do not plant efficiently. The thing is already falling apart. I have to replace a lost bolt. The chain does not adequately cover the seed with soil. Do not waste your money. Buy a more expensive seeder.
5.0,Nice little planter that works well. Beats the back breaking work of
4.0,"Time saving and cost effective. Works well, planted spinach, kale and arugula.  If the seeds are small it does drop multiple seeds, and can grind them up a bit. For the value I was impressed with this machine.  Likes loose soil with minimal clumps for optimal operation."
5.0,love this little planter will be buying the optional planter disks
5.0,Planted all seed just right
5.0,Made planting a breeze
1.0,"If only there were less than 1 star. I greatly anticipated the arrival of my seeder, in the interim I prepared the ground, got watering set up, had all of my seeds on hand. I assembled according to instruction and went out to the most idyllic soil conditions I could create (forked, fluffed and raked soil then spread a 1/2 layer of new, sifted compost over the bed and leveled).

I was depressingly disappointed with the Earthway results. Carrots dropped maybe 5 in the first row, pulverized dozens. Turnips, same result, but perhaps worse. It crushed, dropped or otherwise consumed 5000 turnip seeds in a 100 ft row........I decided to try my beets, it planted beets (thank heavens I had a lb of seed) by the handful, I can look out my back window and see the beets from here it put them down on top of (or barely in) the soil so thick. I could sooner get more even planting and spacing by climbing on my roof, closing my eyes and throwing the seeds in the general direction of my garden.

Yes I used the correct plates, the soil was a delightful loam devoid of chunks or obstructions, the depth setting was adjusted properly.

The Earthway simply does not work, from what I can see it doesn't even try to. I suppose I'll be saving for a Jang, it may be expensive but if it works it'll be a bargain compared to this $100 waste of aluminum and plastic."
5.0,"Fits the spicket, but haven't used it yet. Raining a lot, and still cold. Western P.A."
5.0,Good price
5.0,All good.
5.0,"Frustrated with cheap hoses which delivered cheap results at my residence, I purchased this 100' hose p/n 81-58100 with lifetime warranty about 3 years ago. This year the outer layer split, and two weeks ago I followed the instructions for receiving a replacement. The new hose (also with lifetime warranty) arrived today.  Hats off to the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation in Missouri for being a company who backs their products.  I will seek out this label for all my lawn and garden and tool needs from now on."
5.0,"Strong hose. Did away with the others, especially the cloth, retractable hoses that end up getting pinhole leaks within a few months.
Only wish I would have purchased the 50 footer."
2.0,"You won't want this hose to last a lifetime. It is heavy, kinks like crazy and worse yet, is super stiff. It needs to be 100 degrees outside to be flexible enough to handle easily. An absolute nightmare to wind up on a hose reel. I hate it."
5.0,second one so am satisfied
5.0,Never disappointed with Gilmour flexogen hoses.!!
5.0,Great hose.
3.0,It busted
3.0,"I really wanted to rate this product higher, just couldn't.  The seeder performed, but not as well as I had hoped.  I struggled a bit with running it across tilled and harrowed ground (aprox 3/4 acre), as the seeder had a tendency to plow vs opening a narrow channel in ground to drop seed. When this happened, I consistently needed to lift seeder and re-set in order to get it to work.  Finally, instead of continuing to fight with the seeder, I re-harrowed entire area with my atv several more times to loosen ground more, and that helped to get seeder to run better - but still fought with it.

That said, using this seeder was definitely quicker and easier than planting by hand (which I used to do each year with wife and kids in assembly line fashion, ie 1 person punch, 1 person seed, and 1 person cover, etc).  So from that prospective, it definitely has value.  And it's now almost several months after planting, and the corn is nearly ready to harvest.  Seeder yielded solid rows, and not many mis-drops.  I'm happy with this.

All in all - I liked the product but for $ spent, thought that it would be easier to use.  End results were good, and I'm certain if used in a small garden from bagged soil purchased at gardening store, the seeder would work terrifically.  But in my scenario where using on equipment prepared earth soil, needed to do extra prepping in order to get it to run well."
5.0,"We used this to plant 2600 sunflower seeds. It went quickly and was fun. They thought of everything, it digs a little trench that is easy to adjust, plants the seed and covers it. All you have to do is load the seeds in and push it. Too bad for us that we have a lot of deer with a taste for sunflowers!  We may get a few, but no where near 2600!"
5.0,Works great!!
3.0,worth the price..works well
5.0,
3.0,worked just ok.
5.0,this really works good
5.0,"I got this seeder when I decided to plant a one acre garden.
I had seen the seeder on YouTube and it looked like just what I needed.
It arrived quickly and was well-packed.
Instructions for assembly were included and easy to follow (not much to do really!).
I have used the seeder several times to plant a number of different kinds of seeds. It worked flawlessly each time.
The only difficulty I ever had was when the ground had been worked so much the front whel tried to slip.
That was my fault, not the seeder's.
It sure save a lot of work, and makes my garden look like I know what I am doing... :-)
I would buy this equipment again, and recommend it to anyone looking for a seeder.
I have found nothing not to like...."
2.0,"I purchased and used it this spring and found that it does not evenly place seeds into the ground, I have lots of gaps between my plants, tried several different seeds and found only 50% to 75% of the row had seeds that were growing. Tried using the plate with bigger wholes that was labeled for other seeds and found that it worked much better but had to thin out sprouts because to many were growing in one row."
5.0,This is a very good vegetable seeder
4.0,got this to use for my gray water drain on my RV. Works well and seems to be pretty heavy duty.
5.0,Quality is great and easy to use.
1.0,"I am 75 years old and I can say without a doubt this is the worst garden hose I have ever owned. The first time I used this hose it kinked every 5-6 feet to the point that not a drop of water would flow.  Extremely annoying and the worst performing hose I have ever owned.  Every time I advanced the hose 5-6 feet and remember this is a 100' hose I had to lay the hose down and do back and undo a kink.

When I was finished and tried to reel the hose back in by hand and create a loop pile on the carport floor it did the same thing.  It fought me every step of the way.  This is beyond annoying.  I have used this thing so I will not return it but I can assure you I will never buy this brand again.

And just because I am 75 years old do not think I had these troubles because I am a doddering old geezer.  I am 6' 245 lbs and ride my bike every day and work on my property carrying and dumping 40 lb bags of stone, sand, and mulch.  So I am not a wizened up weakling! Far from it!"
5.0,"pleasantly surprise at how light it actually is, I even ordered another one for the other side of home"
5.0,"Super nice hose!  Very flexible, not stiff even in cold weather.  I would say this is the best quality hose I have owned so far and that includes a bunch.  Worth every penny, cheap hoses just are not worth the trouble.  Just buy it, you'll be glad."
5.0,Heavy Duty Hose with a good abount of flexibility
1.0,the product had two female fitment....unbelievable!
4.0,"A bit heavy, sturdy construction."
5.0,"Fantastic hose -- very durable, yet easy to coil."
5.0,"wanted to wait and write this review after heavy spring/summer use... this hose is terrific... did not kink, no cracks or tears. held up extremely well for watering the garden and flowerbed. we drug this thing all over our yard. did not treat it gently."
5.0,Great hose.  It's nice to finally have a hose that doesn't kink!
5.0,Tough hose.  Great fittings and strain relief
3.0,As a replacement for the same hose purchased several years ago. Not the same quality or resistance to kinking. I'll keep looking.
5.0,This is a great hose! And a great price. Hard to make link and the nozzles are not soft so don't bend when ran over or stepped on.
5.0,Great product!
5.0,Great product!
5.0,I love this hose. barely kinks and feels super durable. I actually bought a second recently for the back of the house.
5.0,"Decent hoses, will kink if they don't have water pressure."
4.0,Good quality hose.
5.0,Flexogen is good.
5.0,Great quality arrived on time
1.0,"I purchased this garden seeder to help me plant about 6 rows of corm. I was one and a half rows into planting and looked down to discover the front tire was crooked and the drive belt had come off. Upon further inspection I noticed the pin that mounts the wheel was broken, now the seeder is totally useless. This is not worth the money and I wouldn't buy it again."
4.0,Huge time saver. Not as precise as a Jang but for 15% of the cost of a Jang it serves my needs just fine. Beets and radishes will need thinning.
2.0,"I have a problem with the seeds ""popping"" out of the seed basket.  If I get a larger plate in then is seeds it double.  I also would like to be able to control the in row spacing. If had it to do over, I would have bought the more expensive competition planter."
5.0,"used for over 2000 ft of rows so far. we garden large.

good =
Very Very fast planting time. I can put in the row as fast as I can walk plus the time to empty and fill the bin with seed and change the planter disk.
I did 500 ft of beets in less than 10 minutes from the time I opened the seed package to the time I put the leftover seeds back.
Works great for consistent depth and spacing.  leaves a nice straight row if you can walk straight.
Lots of seed plates to choose from.

Bad =
finding the correct seed plate may be challenging. for example I often found myself using the next smaller size plate rather than the plate labeled for the seed I was using.  I found that using the ""beet plate"" for beets was double and triple planting my seed, so I went to the next size smaller plate and it worked just fine.  so if not careful this can be a Tremendous seed waster.
You will over or under plant... but that is the price of speed.  expect to thin the row.
The seeds would bind under the plate, especially peas, and pop out of the bin rather than go where they were supposed too. I remedied this by spraying armor all car  protectant on all the plates and the bin, it made them slick and the seeds no longer would bind behind the seed plate and the side of the bin. Probably any wax type spray would work also, or possibly light kitchen oil...
You need to have more seed than you plan to use... when you get down to a hand full of seed in the bin it will no longer feed into the plate consistently and you will have misses.  This is a bulk seed planter buying it to plant one small walmart packet of seed at a time will not work well for this set up.

Conclusion =
when used correctly, on large rows with lots of seed, waxed seed discs and box, proper depth, and garden is tilled well, light and soft and no thick organic matter- finely chopped will be ok but long grasses in the soil will clog the planter. This machine is a 5 star. Without the proper conditions you will have more difficulty with this."
4.0,"Got mine second hand (but I bought the optional seed plates new for it).  Works fine but the prepped ground needs to be smooth and free of lumps (finely tilled and raked smooth).

I find the handle to be a bit short for me, I'm 6'1"" so I have to bend over to use it (must have been built for a midget).  You need to keep the hopper clean and free of dirt and clean the seed plates before and after use (especially with coated seed like sweet corn).

I don't use the row marker at all, I run alongside my row string (every one of my rows are staked at the ends and strung with bailer twine.

Made in Indiana and should last forever.  I suggest applying a couple drops of oil to the wheel hubs every year.  Maintenance wise, other than keeping the hopper and seed plates clean, thats about it.

Nice planting tool for a larger garden saves your back and knees.  Things like onion sets still need to be planted by hand however."
4.0,"Easy to assemble. At first it didn't work, but I found out you must have smooth ground for it to work,  if your rows are chunky,bumpy or uneven it does not work well..**My Hint**>>> I tilled my rows well, then I went down the middle of them with my lawn tractor with the wheel in center of row, making the dirt smooth and flat/ Then you can adjust the bottom to dig slightly making a small cut, and it will dispense better.  after going down the row it does not plant the seeds always, so just take a heavy rake and pull the dirt onto the seeds, and wha-la your done."
5.0,Made garden planting easy
5.0,"A very good seeder. It is best to have the soil well rototilled, dry and free of clumps. If the dirt sticks to the ground opener, it's too wet."
4.0,"Needs more weight on the front so it is not necessary to push down so hard. Otherwise, very helpful planting the garden."
5.0,A very good investment. I have been gardening and working construction since1960. This is the best hose I have used. It does kink if you mishandle it. The simple way to avoid that is to correctly handle it. Do not leave it out where it can be stolen.
1.0,"It kinks, period.  Especially when it's been in the sun.  Grrrr."
5.0,used this hose so to add another outside  faucet great price for hose
5.0,Hose works great and seems like it will hold up for a long time!
5.0,This works perfectly with my hydra mini pump.
4.0,Very good hoses. This is one of those get what you pay for times. Buy cheap hoses you throw away after a year or 2 or just get these and be happy for long time.
4.0,good
5.0,"Good product, low price, shipped quickly."
4.0,"Good quality. No kinking, and good flow."
5.0,"I have used Gilmour Flexogen for some time and have never had a bad experience.  Cold weather we don't have in South Texas.  Multiple days of 100+ weather we do have.  I am looking forward to using this 75' in the garden, where the lawn irrigation does reach, and any other remote locations.  The others have been left out all year, since hear we use them all year."
5.0,Great time saver easy to assemble
5.0,"This thing JUST WORKS!  I put out almost my entire garden with this seeder.  I was literally planting 50' rows of corn, etc. in 30 seconds or less.  My garden is well tilled, and this thing just went right through it.

If I could change one thing about it, I would make the handle a bit longer as I'm 6'7"", but I was still able to use it."
5.0,Great product. Great price .fast shipping.  Exactly what it says .and I love this seeder planter !!! Will be purchacing more plates
3.0,It was ok I find it hard to use .  Seeds every where because there was not a lid for the hopper.
5.0,plants corn great.  I have the 4 hole sweet corn plate and several others.  Use to plant beans and corn for a few years with it.  Highly reccomend it!
3.0,"So far I have only received the seeder and put it together. I can say this so far; it is very lightweight. As in, lightweight materials so care is going to have to be used when planting with it. Thin aluminum and plastic. That being said if it works, that's not such a big issue. I am guessing your soil will need to be well tilled. It is obviously not designed to go through rough ground. My biggest issue is that the sweet corn plate does not hold in place. I contacted them and they are aware of this issue, their exact words, and are working to fix it. As for now they suggest placing tape on the hubs that hold the plates in place. Without using it I'm not sure if that is a viable option or not. I will be using it this weekend so I guess I will find out."
5.0,Works great behind a tiller... Found that slowing my walk improved the consistency..
3.0,"The seeder is useless on large seeds like lima beans,cushaw squash and pumpkin.  The seed delivery tube has 2 sharp bends where the seeds jam up.  The cover for the tube id not easily removed.  ok on smaller seeds."
1.0,"I agree with the other review here which points out how cheaply this product is made. There was no mention in the description of this item that you need to have pounds of any one given seed for the hopper to work properly. And what is the point of all the specific labels like seed plates specifically for leeks, radishes, lettuce, etc, when it simply does not work for such small seeds? Corn and peas is about the only thing it works for.

I put in some pelletized lettuce seeds in that were very expensive and this thing ground them all up like a peppercorn grinder!

Don't waste your money on this and seed the old fashioned way. I guarantee you'll be done with it quicker and the results will be 100% every time."
5.0,Well made exactly the quality I was expecting to receive.
4.0,This will kink but not as badly as most hoses.
4.0,Seems fine.  Lightweight and easy to handle.
1.0,Leak.  These hose leak.  No matter how you tighten them or anything else they still leak.
5.0,"Love this hose, no kinks and attractive color"
4.0,Good quality hose
5.0,very strong it looks like it will last a life time !!!!
4.0,"After a few weeks of routine use I can say it's at least a decent product that should last a couple of seasons (hopefully more).  It claims to retain its flexibility even near freezing temperatures, though I'll roll it up and stow it through the winter to extend its life.

On the other hand, I'll shorten its life by leaving it pressurized more than is recommended...so we'll see how it bears up under that strain."
1.0,"Although it was light weight..while watering while washing clothes, there was a surge of water that caused a leak in the hose...the hose ultimately ended up with four leaks after dragging it across the sidewalk."
5.0,"My expert garden shop sells these but they didn't have the shorter length. Excellent product, no leakage. Wish all of my hoses came from this company. Costly but well worth the money."
4.0,this is a heavy duty hose that works great
4.0,"I've only planted some peas as of yet, but so far so good. A heck of a lot faster and easier than seeding by hand. The seeder's made of pretty cheap materials but if you use it properly and take care of it I think it will last quite a while. There are better seeders out there but they are hundreds of dollars more expensive, so I think this seeder's worth the price."
3.0,Makes it easy to plant seeds but is wasteful because it tends to dump several seeds at a time.  Seeds are relatively cheap when compared to the time it takes to do this by hand.
5.0,"I have a 60'x90' garden and this is very useful for seeding1  Spacing and ""back saving""!!"
5.0,Great planter. I wish they would offer more seed plates.
1.0,Was missing a hex nug so i had to run to homedepo
5.0,GOOD PRICE AND A TERRIFIC BACK SAVER.  WORKED VERY WELL PLANTING CORN.
4.0,"I haven't used this one yet, but I had another that was lost in a barn fire. They aren't bad especially if your garden surface to be planted is completely free of chucks of dirt. The smoother your garden surface the easier it is to use. There are several seed plates included. Honestly I haven't ever tried to plant tiny seed with it only larger seed like sweet corn, beans, peas,etc."
1.0,"Not a product worth buying, the seeds pop out while trying to plant, its too short for my husband to use. Earthway, if you have a lid could you please send it to me? Maybe then I can use it, as it is right now I can not use it with the seeds flying out."
5.0,"Wow mind blowing back saving item I love it , gets the job done real quick as long ure in loose soil. The best way too use this planter is to make  dry runs down the rows first & then go back and plant ure seeds!!"
3.0,"I garden on a very large scale and seed planting, with all the required bending kills my back.  After watching the farmers sitting in their tractors planting seeds faster than I can make a few dozen holes, I went searching for a better solution and purchased the Earthway Precision Garden Seeder with 6 seed plates.  I also purchased all the extra plates as well.  After preparing my garden soil, I set to work planting seeds with my new tool.  Unfortunately, I found that it took way more seeds than I needed for it to even work making the last of my seeds almost impossible to plant unless I overbuy seeds each year.  Even with a full hopper, seed dispersal is very inconsistent.  Most times I will run over a row 2 or 3 times to make sure I have enough seed planted to end up with a garden worth tending.  Sometimes I will get multiple seeds planted in the same spot, but mostly, I end up with more skips than planted seeds.  While my back much prefers the Earthway method to seed planting, after trying to use it for a couple of seasons, I ended up going back to hand sowing and the my Garden Seeder sits unused in the tool shed."
5.0,Gilmour hoses are some of the best around. I have used them for years. These stand up to high water pressure very well.
4.0,"Big, heavy duty hose. Heavy to drag around, which doesn't bother me, but if you have physical disabilities you might want a lighter hose. I gave it 4 stars only because it's still hard to get to lay flat, even in the sun. Will kink up if I try to 'pull it out' of the memory it develops from being rolled up. Good hose other than that."
5.0,So far it's been working fine. You can tell it's quality and it will last a long time.
5.0,good quality
5.0,good hose.  will know more if it lasts 5 years
5.0,"I spent a lot of time researching hoses and this was what I decided on. So happy about the purchase. This hose is flexible, light weight and easy to use. No kinking at all so far. My husband says, ""it's a fine hose."" I researched and bought the thing, and now he has to use it, so that's good enough for me. This is a really solid product. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Works fine.
5.0,What can you say about a hose. Looks good and has brass ends.
1.0,"What's wrong with it?  1. It's made of carcinogenic materials with instructions to wash your hands after touching it.  2. Other than carcinogenic, it does not offer a clue as to what it is made from.  3. It smells bad.  4. The description on Amazon says it is good for up to 500 psi of water pressure but it tells you not to use it with more than 100 psi or water pressure.  I am returning it."
5.0,Formidable hose!  I didn't know they made them this good.  Seriously substantial!  Bye bye big box stores!
2.0,"For limited use under certain conditions it does ok. Too light for most soil conditions,  terrible ergonomics and location for handle, flimsy seed plates. Terrible compared to my vintage Planet Jr. no 4 and Sears David Bradley seeders.
 The Hoss wheel hoe with their seeder attachment is far and away superior, being much better in quality and value, plus it's useful the entire growing season for weeding and cultivating."
5.0,Great product. We planted seeds in just 15 minutes that usually takes us three hours or more.
5.0,"My parents had a similar seeder 30+ years ago and I gave it to my in-laws for their garden a few years ago.  This is our second year of having a garden on our new property and I was not going to plant again without one of these!  Super simple to assemble, easy to use, GREAT PRODUCT!"
5.0,"Works very well, just as expected, since I had borrowed one just like it and knew what to expect."
5.0,"This ex""seeded"" our expectations"
5.0,Just as expected. Works great planted our garden with ease. Receive on time.
4.0,Works very well in properly prepared soil!
5.0,"Came very quickly, actually arrived 1 day early. It was a gift for my husband. He said it worked just as he hoped.  This clearly is for a serious gardener with a larger garden.  Cleans up easily."
4.0,Quality and affordable.  Easy to use and worth it for even the largest of gardens.  For use in pre tilled soil without clumps.
3.0,Did not work as I wanted it to. Ground has to be in perfect condition. No weeds or clumps of soil allowed. Tried to use in a food plot that had been disked and lightly roto tilled it only worked where it was thoroughly worked.
4.0,great hose pipe ..that's it
5.0,"As advertised!  Great length for my yard, no need to add extra hoses."
5.0,Best hose ever. I have found that there is no such thing as a no kink hose but this hose is as close as you can get. After purchasing this we purchased another three for the rest of the house. Highly recommend.
5.0,Flexogen hoses are the best.  This is a nice long length. It does kink occasionally.  This one seems lighter than the ones I've used in the past.  My wife loves the gray color.  It looks better than the light green we have bought before.
5.0,nice
5.0,All good!
5.0,Great value great product
4.0,Super flexible hose.  Love it!!
5.0,perfect
5.0,Got this for my dad as a Christmas present since he wanted a new hose. This is a nice strong hose that is very durable. He has forgotten about it and rode over it with his lawnmower and wheelbarrow and it still works perfectly. It is a little cumbersome due to thei weight but otherwise highly recommend for a durable hose
4.0,"This seeder really sped up my planting. I could do an acre in the time it used to take me to hand plant two 30 foot rows. I did experience some corn seed poping out of the container like some of the other reviews have said. I've only used it once though, so I still need to work with it. I'd say my first go my seed rate was only 50%. But the straight rows the same width apart really helps with keeping weeds down."
5.0,"I really love this seeder!! did most of my yard, made seeding very quick and easy! Only thing is that you have to put a fair amount of seed since it won't pick up the little bits on the very bottom."
1.0,Very pleased
5.0,excellent product. works great!
1.0,"Junk,Junk,Junk. Spacing is hit or miss, usually miss. Seeds lodge behind plates. Depth only works in perfectly flat groomed soil. Poorly balanced, you have to bear down and push this junk along. The fertilizer attachment is utterly frustrating, try banding fertilizer 1 1/2"" deep, you'll have no idea if any is coming out. Open fertilizer gate and fertilizer pours out, so you either getting none or too much. I did several rows 4 times yesterday and I'm not confident I put any fertilizer down. I threw it to the side and spread fertilizer by hand and cultivated it in. Oh yah, hooking the fertilizer attachment on is fun also. HA!"
5.0,This saved us a tremendous amount of time and back strain compared to hand planting seeds. Make sure your soil is well prepped. It doesn't like a heavy crust that we get from our soil after a rain. We rototilled and then went away for memorial weekend and got a heavy rain while we were gone. This is a well engineered machine that works as advertised. Well worth the price.
5.0,AWESOME
4.0,"Great planter for small to medium jobs.  However, if you are tall, then the handle is WAY too short.  Recommend handle extensions if you are going to plant for long periods of time."
5.0,Love my Earthway planter!!!
5.0,If you have ever planted a garden the other way you will absolutely appreciate this seeder.  I couldn't do without it.
5.0,"I bought this flexogen hose because every other hose we bought never lasted very long,but this hose is very sturdy and has not bubbled .It is a little bit heavy to move around,but it is worth it. Great product. Would buy it again if I needed another."
5.0,Not an easy size to find. Thank goodness for Gilnour products. This is a well made hose. Will definitely stand the test of time. Have purchased many Gilmour products and all have been durable.
5.0,Well made hose and stands up well to t he New Mexico sun
2.0,I thought I was buying a premium hose for this price. I tried it out this morning and was not happy with this hose.  The primary reason I returned it to Amazon was the last 8 or 9 feet of hose on the nozzle end was kinked and would not straighten out.  Even in the sun.  Even with water pressure in it.  It was supposed to be kink free.  It looks to me like a cheaper poly hose with maybe one ply of fiber netting in it.  Obviously had something not built right on that end at least.  Of course I couldn't really affirm that since I took the time and effort to roll it back up to stuff it in the box to return it. This was my first Gilmour product and will definitely be my last.  Very unhappy with it. Thanks Amazon for taking back shoddy products..
1.0,"complete piece of junk. Like most hoses, the piece that connects to the nozzle has a stop that prevents it from forming a good seal. IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTACH NOZZLE LEAK FREE. Got it from Home Depot, returning back to the store tomorrow. It really takes an idiot to design it this way."
5.0,Been working  all dummer so far
5.0,Just as described and arrived on time.  Great product and service.
2.0,I didn't like it. Its heavy and hard to handle.  Like gu
5.0,"Considering the price, so far this hose is working out well. We did not want to put anything too nice on that side of the house. The neighbors have a problem with taking and using things that belong to me, and not returning them until they are broken, so we used this to fill out the balance of a $35 order to get free next day shipping. It is not as nice as out heavy Flexogen, but it's not as expensive either."
5.0,I have an older flexogen hose that I bought 25 years ago and it is going strong.  I did have to replace the nozzle end (car ran over) and this product seems to behave in the same manner.  Great hose.
5.0,A great little appliance. A real labour saving device
1.0,"This was a terrible seeder for corn. Didn't try any other seed. Many skips,  and corn was grinding against the wheel and flying out at times. Spend $200 more dollars and buy the green Hoss Seeder, I did and I really like it."
1.0,Amazon  sent this in an ad to me to entice me to buy one. Bought one  years ago and it was way too light to last. One is better off buying the TD-1 Jang from Woodward crossings. It will hold up.
4.0,"It does as described for the most part. It distributes seed more consistently when the hopper is at least half full. I used the small peas plate to plant silver queen corn and it worked just fine. What would take me an hour or so by hand this will do in minutes. Yes I would buy again.
I have 7 60 foot rows of corn I plant and 3 rows of black eyes peas and this planted it all. I did disk with a tractor and rowed it all up then ran a tiller down the tops, all the planter had to do was drop the seed and it did. A real time saver. Like I said, keep the seed in hopper at an adequate level and it's spacing is fairly consistent. I didn't tape up holes either. I just plan on thinning peas with a hoe if needed. I did use the corn plate at first and it would drop two at once. I swapped it with the small pea plate and it did fine. I did lean it over to one side when the seed got low so it would pick it up better. For the most part it looks to be plenty sturdy for a hand planter, no it's not going to take heavy abuse. Like in the bed of a truck for months with stuff on top of it."
1.0,"I purchased this a few months ago in anticipation of spring. Put it together, installed the correct plate on it, and started to try to seed my corn in my freshly tilled garden.  The plate missed picking up seeds right and left to the point I had no confidence that any were making it to the ground. The next row marker was useless too. Flimsy product that just doesn't work well at all.... Wish I had known ahead of time. $100+ is a bit much to throw away like this. I also bought extra seed plates. Sigh...."
5.0,Great for planting a large garden.  Excellent for any gardner.
5.0,great
2.0,Too fragile
5.0,my dad loves it it used it in the garden with time to plant seeds
1.0,Don't buy this..  The seeds get stuck in the wheel and the seeder quits working.  Amazon sells crap........
3.0,"Bought this hose about 6 weeks ago but just installed it last weekend. Only used it three times and already developed holes in the places where a pinch occurred. Seems like the 8 ply design separates and creates a hole. Appears to be high quality materials but I've never had this happen with a hose before - not a good design.

Update- I was past the 30 day return period on Amazon so I contacted Gilmour directly. They sent me a new hose immediately - excellent customer service!"
5.0,"It is very rare that I write reviews but I decided to write a review for this Gilmour 8-Ply Flexogen Hose because I had purchased other very good name brand hoses from a Very Big Box Store and within days I had to return them as they leaked or bursted out - a total of three (3) hoses in less than two weeks time. One of them bursted open in few hours of use. Anyway out of frustration I decided to a little bit of my own research and found that the hoses that are rated for 500 psi and made of good quality materials are better and I also read  the entire detailed description of Gilmour Flexogen 8-Ply hose and got convinced. I must say that in the past I have found Gilmour brand products to be superior quality. I have been using Gilmour Flexogen hose (in beautiful grey color) for about a month and NOT one drop of water leaks anywhere. EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I will update my review after I have used it for some more time. What a blessing it is to use good quality, No Nonsense products. THANK YOU GILMOUR.

5.0,"Just what I needed.  It is difficult to find a high quality 25 foot hose, but not on Amazon.  Perfect"
5.0,I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and bought two shorter hoses instead of one very long one.  This hose really is very good quality and it is nice to wash my car without the leaky hose spraying almost as much water on me as the car. It does not kink! aleviating another problem with the old hose. I disliked wrestling with the old hose every time I wanted to wash the car.  It was shipped promptly and arrived on time.
4.0,have used it a week with no problems. Am not using a sprayer in order to keep pressure down to avoid hose bursting as some of the reviews pointed out.
5.0,"Maybe so but this one arrived completely kink free, connected easily and seamlessly to my spigot, and unrolled without wanting to roll right back up again. It appears to be well made and is very flexible.
Who could ask for more?"
5.0,Very high quality fittings and hose. Uses an O-ring washer though (installed from the manufacturer).
5.0,"More than my expectation, also the price very reasonable.
Thank you.
Accjr Concord, Ca"
4.0,"Sturdy hose, and a great value. Nice textured black color."
4.0,"The write-up says it will not kink.  I find that not to be true.  I really like the hose, but every time I use it, it kinks until I un-wind the kink.  Otherwise, I would have given it a ""5"" star rating."
5.0,very good
1.0,I found this seeder did not work for me. Seed spacing was erratic with it dropping 3-5 seeds at a time then going two feet before it dropped another. I was planting seeds so I tried the small seed plate and the issue was worse. Also found that you have to have perfectly tilled soil for it to be able to get the results I got above. If my soil was anything less than perfect the results were much worse. I would much rather seed the old fashion way to 1) ensure I am indeed getting proper spacing and 2) not wasting seeds.
5.0,Great product.
3.0,This is an ok built planter and it is very useful but it doesn't look like the picture.  The handle is not adjustable and I have to stoop low to operate. Needs adjustable handle to use properly.
5.0,SOOOOOO much easier to plant.  Takes me two days to plant 3 acres by my self.
4.0,works great
5.0,"satisfied, good price and product"
5.0,No complaints built attachment to pull behind John Deere 2320
5.0,A good product for the money
5.0,"This machine does exactly as advertised. We planted rows of corn, okra, beans, and peas this past summer with the Earthway seeder and it all came up! Our rows were about 50 yards long and we had about 6 rows, it took about 2 hours total to plant with this machine. It would have took about 2 days if we had to do it by hand. I would highly recommend this product if you have a backyard garden, your back will appreciate the purchase!"
5.0,"I bought this because I needed another hose out by the garden area and/or to extend the 50 foot one I have at the house.

I don't know a lot about garden hoses, but I know that I wasted money buying really inexpensive ones that were nothing but a pain to  use with kinking and leaking issues.  I bought one very good quality hose a month or so go.. but realized that I had only solved half the problem so I decided to try Gilmour  to resolve the  extra footage that I needed,after reading the reviews on it

It is hard to say anything more than all the other  783 customers have said.. so I will simply say... its a good hose, it works perfect for me with no leaks, and I would not hesitate to buy it again.  I do think it is a bit heavy compared to my old cheap hoses, but the quality may come with the weight and I love the ease in rolling it up without having to stop and unkink it.

All in all.. thumbs up from me."
4.0,"Good hose, but in the heat it does twist and kink."
5.0,"Excellent,  highly recommend."
5.0,I sooooooooooo love these hoses.  I may have to write another review later but on first inspection they are a 100 x better than the kink and kink and really kink hoses that I have presently.  Spend the extra money (just keep them away from your mower!!).  You will be soo glad you did.
5.0,Best hose I've ever had. Wish I'd gotten a longer one! Turn the water off and squirt out any water in the hose and it curls up beautifully with no kinks.
2.0,"Very disappointed in this hose.  Bought to replace a Colorite WaterWorks hose and is not nearly as flexible or as easy to coil up when finished using.  The Colorite Waterworks hose was very flexible and my only complaint with that Colorite hose was that the brass couplings would break after two or three years of use and were not abused in any way.  Was hoping this Gilmour hose would be as flexible and easy to move around as the Colorite but feels much stiffer and kinks easily if you do not twist it while uncoiling or coiling to reduce torque.  I've had many hoses which did not kink in the past.  Don't know why they still can't make them that way, especially when new ones cost this much money.  Yet another case of things being made better in the good old days."
3.0,"hose is long enough to reach all of my gardens, but it does have a tendency to kink and cut off the water flow"
1.0,"Terrible hose. Twists up when ANY water pressure is applied.
RETURNED!"
3.0,"These Gilmour hoses are NOT the same as they used to be when Gates manufactured Flexogen hoses.  Since about 2005, I believe it was Bosch, that took over the product and ever since, these hoses have slowly and eventually become stiff and hard in cool to cold weather just like the competition. They aren't worth the extra dollars as they used to be so, just take advantage of the warranty and return them as needed to create the value that they took away from the actual hose and it's well known flexibility over other branded hoses."
2.0,"Kinks
Hint: roll hose put before turning water on."
4.0,don't try to use this in wet ground or new ground
5.0,"This seeder works great. If you have rocky or clumpy soil, it will be hard to use though. It seems to drop seed accurately. The product is built strong and light."
4.0,
5.0,good delivery. easy assembly. well see how well it works this spring.
4.0,This is a wonderful tool for a medium size garden
3.0,Ground has to be tilled to a fine powder. I really struggled with it dropping doubles and triples. I'm ok with with for food plots but it was a nightmare for me when planting sweet corn and beans in the garden. I am keeping it for food pots but will hand plant garden again next year.
5.0,This was a gift for my husband and he loved it.  He used this little thing when planting his garden this past spring and it made it much easier.
5.0,"Great bit of gear , planted an acre of corn in a matter of 21/2 hours instead of the 4 days I spent last year to do 1/4 acre . Precise spaces fast and accurate , well made .
David , New Zealand"
4.0,This works well! Saves my husbands back!!
5.0,"Seeder worked well even with small grain (quinoa). Very evenly spaced and the chain that drags covered enough. I did an acre with this and the seeder was fantastic, saving me a lot of time and far more economical than a broadcast seeder."
5.0,"Despite being tightly coiled for shipment, the hose lay perfectly straight on my driveway after unboxing. More amazing, I coiled it in larger coils
immediately and they conformed to the container with ease. Very impressive product with high quality fittings; many good years of use lie ahead!"
5.0,Gilmour makes the best products.  perfect weight and strength for a serious gardener.
1.0,"This hose arrived with several bubbles in it.  Today one of the bubbles popped, spraying water everywhere.  Hose is useless to me.  Replacement will be on the way and I hope this one is better than the last."
4.0,"This is solid hose for garden use.  It is more rugged than others I have had and the fittings are excellent.  Despite claims, it is not kink proof, but that is a small thing, as I don't think any hose really is kink proof.  And the quality here is clearly above ordinary garden hose."
1.0,"Never thought I would give a bad rating to an expensive garden hose, but the warranty seems worthless.  I say that, as there is no one manning the Call Center at Gilmour.  Sure, they have a lifetime warranty, but our hose failed due to a problem with the metal in the female connector.  It literally corroded away.  Sure, we've owned it for many years, but that's not the point.

The point is that if you call their 866 Support line (just try it), it will say ""12th caller in the queue, we are busy, please use our website... blah,blah, blah"".  Use the website to file a claim and you get no reply.  Call back later and it will say ""12th caller in the queue...""  Coincidence?  I waited 35 minutes on hold and filnally got to ""You are Caller Zero"".

Which at 4:20 EST on a Tuesday, should mean you get your turn right?  Wrong.  I stayed at Caller Zero for another 10 minutes.  No one answered.  Emailed the company via their website...  still waiting on an answer.

So, if YOU are buying this hose for the Lifetime Warranty.  Dont.  And, if you think it will last a long time.  It didnt.  Don't believe me.  Check the picture.  Since there is no way to contact anyone in Customer Service at GILMOUR and they have no Facebook page, this One Star Review and picture will have to suffice."
5.0,Great Hose. Very flexible and easy to work with. Hadn't had it very long but it appears well made and should go the distance.
5.0,"This hose is a bargain. I have shopped hoses at Home Depot, Ebay, Walmart, and here on Amazon. I was looking for a stout and reasonably kink-proof hose for the sprinkler in my front yard. For the price, this one cannot be beat. This is a very good quality hose that has been a pleasure to use and I've ended the problem I had with the last hose kinking when dragging it into place. No kinking with this one so far."
5.0,Excellent hose and very durable.  I've used it for over a month now and it is just as described.  No leaks and not so heavy that I have to drag it.
1.0,"...horse poopoo!  Advertised as 600PSI test, 8-ply build, this hose leaked at BOTH ends after overnight 60PSI test.  Attached for your enjoyment is a cross-section of the hose I probably can't send back for a refund.  Now I ain't no rocket scientist but even on close up I can't see more than two layers separated by a flimsy nylon mesh..."
1.0,"it was a selection we found when searching for ""rubber garden hose"" and it's made of vinyl. we sent it back. might be a good product, but amazon listed it along with other hoses that are actually rubber hoses, which is what we now have after returning the gilmour product"
4.0,"There is a competing seeder by the brand of Jang (nearly $400), that may be of interest to those reviewers who are critical of this Earthway.  For more on the comparison by a farmer who used both, as well as some useful tips on easy modifications, and more, try Googling
 ""  Jang or Earthway? A small farm vegetable seeder comparison  "".  The aforementioned article is found at the  rethinkingagriculture dot com  website.

As for me, I will be trying this Earthway come next spring (if the oil bust in North Dakota doesn't force me to relocate), and will update with my experience at that time."
5.0,"It has really made a lot of my seed planting a lot easier.
I was amazed how fast I was able to sow a 30'X30"" patch of corn and similar patch of beans and peas.

It also cur down on waste by precisely spacing the seeds and distributing them properly"
5.0,A OK
5.0,worked well
5.0,Great. Thank you.
5.0,Great gadget. A real back saver. Plants multiple types of seed at the correct depth and covers the seeds too.
5.0,My mother loves it
4.0,"Works as intended, would recommend for purchase.

Suggested modifications.
1 - buy a seed cover, the stand makes it easy to tip over and loose all your precious cargo."
1.0,"I was very disappointed in the performance of this machine.  Mainly wanted it for small seeds like carrots. Not only do you need a lot of carrot seed for the plate to pick them up, they then slip behind the plate and won't continue up to drop to the ground. Beet seeds plugged up and planted very sporadically. Green beans jammed somewhere along the way. Of course you can't see all this until the next week when the seeds sprout. Wish I had not wasted my money."
5.0,We purchased this for a friend.  We have one that was purchased in the early 1970s and still going strong after 40 years.  Wouldn't be able to plant a garden with out it as it would be too hard bending over to drop seeds.  I would recommend it to anyone who plants a vegetable garden.  Another friend borrowed it every year till he bought one for himself.
1.0,"I never had a hose that kinked so easily as this one. When it kinks, it totally cuts off water flow. Most hoses just lose pressure when they kink. This one loses all pressure. My Sears Craftsman hose is 10 times better."
4.0,"I guess I should have purchased a longer hose.  We live in So Cal --- which means a car wash does double duty...water the lawn while washing the car.
It's definitely a good quality hose.  Will order a longer one soon."
4.0,Strong and flexible.  Still can kink if you don't watch it; otherwise I would've given it 5 star rating.
5.0,best hose out there won't kink
1.0,"For the high price and glowing reviews, thought for sure I'd get several years of use from this ""quality"" hose but nope...I bought this last year and have used it about 5 months and now it leaks! I have never had a hose leak where this one does - about an inch up from the crimp on male brass fitting(see pic). Btw, the hose was drained and stored indoors last fall/winter and this is not a simple washer issue...It is leaking in the middle of the brass...Very strange and disappointing - especially for this price! Save your money...

Update: Glimour is replacing the hose at no charge per their warranty. I filled out a form on their website and included this pic - nothing to mail in - they are taking my word. [...]

I will update when I receive it and then again after a similar amount of use. Hopefully they have the (known?) problem fixed as I really am needing additional quality hoses to purchase in the near future but I am now very hesitant...

This still doesn't change my one star rating for the hose; however, they do have 5 star customer service..."
5.0,"As pictured, described and expected and it arrived on time."
1.0,"It worked well the first season. This spring it sprung a leak just beneath the nut, so it cannot be repaired. A hose should last more than one season."
4.0,Good product!
5.0,great hose
5.0,"Great hose, since it is not affected by weather."
5.0,"Works great for me. Used in well tilled soil. Soil is extremely rocky, but with a little effort, this seeder pushed aside 3 and 4 inch rocks. I planted 14 eighty foot rows of corn in 45 minutes. I like this planter a lot. No bending over to plant garden. For $100, this is a great tool for planting corn, beans and peas.  I did add weight to the chain and to the end of the row marker. For once a year use, the planter is plenty sturdy enough. I would buy this again."
5.0,"If you have a Sm garden YOU need the EarthWay and ALL the attachments. It will save you a LOT of time and your rows of seed will be spaced right and strait every  time. My garden is about two ac. I use my earthway to plant all my seed ( corn,cabbage,turnips,peas,beans,okra,water mellows,squish,eggplant seed) just to name a few."
5.0,Makes planting the garden fast and easy
5.0,Love it for food plots
5.0,great
1.0,Easy to use but sweet corn seed spacing was very poor with numerous long gaps.  Seems that 2 seeds at a time went into the slots and then would not fall.  Very disappointed.
5.0,"Ordered the Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeded with 6 plates after I realized that with advancing age, ours, not the seeder, the ground was just a little too far down to have our old back chasing seeds. Great product."
5.0,This seeder is AWESOME!  We planted sixty feet of sweet corn in less than 10 minutes.  We love to garden and now we love it even more.
4.0,"I really like the planter.  I thought it sowed fertilizer too but it doesn't, but besides that, I love it, although, the really small seeds don't seem to feed that well.  Do you have a special disc for smaller seeds?"
4.0,"There are definite advantages to using this tool. More uniformity in spacing and depth, However, there are some disadvantages for a small garden. Since the rows are short, it seems like you just get started and then you are at the end of the row. Also, for a small garden you use less seed, and then the disc does not pick up the seed due to the lack of quantity. Because it was my first use this year, I had to see what worked and what didn't. I did not know what worked until the seeds started growing. I had problems with static and that caused two seeds to be planted together. Tricks of the (trade) use will have to be learned. Overall, I am glad I purchased the tool."
5.0,Fantastic!  Durable.  Exactly what you need !  A +
5.0,excellent hose!
5.0,"I do like this hose.  No kinks, and easy to put back on the hose hanger after use.  Good strong connectors.  Good buy!"
5.0,My husband buried this hose in the yard last year to run down to my garden. Still working great!
5.0,Works well and durable
4.0,"I have only had it a few weeks, but so far so good. While it is better than any hose I have ever owned, it has kinked once or twice. I would still buy it again though."
5.0,"I just received the 50 foot premium duty 5/8"" Gilmour Flexogen 10058050 as a warranty replacement from the one I bought in 2008. The male end fitting was much thinner than the current replacement, and it had separated between the threads. I have read some comments on Amazon that warranties weren't being honored. They are being handled by Fiskars, and it took about 3 weeks to get the new hose. Go to gilmour.com/warranty-information. I included a photo of the failed fitting and the purchase receipt. Great customer service is worth a mention, and I don't work for Gilmour. By the way, the wrapper says not to use with water exceeding 100 degrees."
5.0,It is thinner than the last flexogen hose I bought but very good and lighter so perhaps easier to use. I like the colors.
5.0,"Fantastic hose. Holding up very well. A bit stiff, but that's the price for a kink free hose."
4.0,"Good, strong hose.  It is still a little stiff so it does tangle a little."
5.0,Very easy to use. Cuts my gardening time in half. Love it!
4.0,It works very well. It is much better than a hoe or pick axe. However don't think that you can just push the handle. It still took a lot of muscle to get it through the garden
4.0,ok it has been used twice now.. So far so good.. You grab and think its a bit rickety and by some perspectives it is.. But you have to rate it on whether or not it does the job intended and how well it does that job. I got to use 3 different plates so far and even the smallest one did a great job of distributing the seeds. Other reviews talked about the ground having to be pure smooth for it to work.. I did not experience that issue however to improve my odds my rows were freshly worked (tilled) so it didn't have any problem with the uneven surface. I would think due to its weight if the ground was not freshly worked it might cause an issue but following the instructions proved it does the job and it does it well. The reason for 4 vs 5 stars was the row marker.. I just took it off. It did not leave a very clear line at all but it was not necessary for my application anyway as it is not long enough to cover the distance I need to both accommodate the crop and the tractor I am using to cultivate with.
5.0,Easy to assemble and saves time and backaches. It has handled all my garden seeds this year so far Great product and very well made. Thank you.
1.0,One word JUNK!
4.0,Had an older model but lost it when our garage burned. This one works about the same although I've noticed it sometimes skips loading seed corn as smoothly as the older one.. Not sure if the plates have been changed or the seed we use is just larger but beware you probably need to run down the rows twice to get a good stand of corn.
4.0,It worked fairly well
5.0,It works great after tilling and preparing the soil. Great marking tool with sized wheels for each vegetable row clearly marked and ready to go.
4.0,Works just like the old ones a few extra plastic parts but seeds nicely.
5.0,My husband loves this little planter.  It has saved time in the garden and his back.
5.0,worth the extra money  well made
2.0,I don't know what it is with hoses anymore. Doesn't matter how much you spend they leak at the faucet and whatever sprayer you put on. At least no kinks yet.
2.0,"Buyer Beware!  Misleading. This hose it not 50 feet long.  When we received it, we opened it and uncoiled it.  The first time we used it, we realized it was shorter than our previous 50 foot hose that this one replaced.  It would not reach the far side of the flower bed as the previous hose did.  So....we measured the new hose it is less than 47 feet long."
5.0,great hose
5.0,"I love this tough, durable hose. The length is perfect for a large backyard & kinking is a minimum even in cold weather. It is easy to attach to the faucet & the water flow is great. An extra is the metal spiral at the faucet end to keep it from crimping where it hangs down. Much better than the plastic sleeves on other brands. The 8-ply construction is tough enough to withstand the elements be they hot or cold. I've had this hose for about 8-10 months & it is as good as the day I bought it. So Gilmour is my hose of choice for the future."
5.0,super easy to reel in and very durable!
5.0,"Heavy duty is correct. No hyperbole here. This is a rugged heavy duty hose that gets the job done with no leaks, no holes, and added durability."
5.0,"perfect length at 75 ' and very fast shipping,works great!"
3.0,"Decent hose.  It still kinks to a small degree, but is easier to straighten than my previous hose (which was a piece of garbarge....I spent most of my time trying to straighten it out and eventually just threw it away).  The hose material itself appears to be good quality and hopefully will last a long time.  My only wish is that the brass fittings on either end were a little more heavy duty."
1.0,Hose snapped at connection to faucet after a few months.  Wasn't abused or stretched - just poor quality construction.  Far too expensive for the quality.
5.0,"Just as all the others say, this unit does the job. My only question is why I waited for so long."
5.0,Seeds and covers a row in seconds!!
4.0,Works great in well prepared seed bed.
4.0,Great product.
4.0,MY customers l love using this product. Thanks AG
4.0,done pretty good skipped some corn seed but over all good did the bean seeds good
4.0,very satisfied with this item. does an outstanding job.
4.0,"I read the problems about the seeds getting stuck behind the seed plates. I solved the problem. When planting peas, the seed would get wedged behind the plate and bend it. To solve this problem, I simply filled the hopper up with water. Once all of the pea seeds were wet, they flowed through the mechanism with no problems. String bean seeds however only work dry for me."
5.0,This product was everything it said. Sturdy construction
5.0,Product arrived 5 days earlier than promised. Works great. The spacer bar needs to be longer.
5.0,"I've been through a few garden hoses from big-box stores, either they kink very badly or leak through the fittings. This one does neither - I'd buy another but I don't see this one wearing out anytime soon."
5.0,Great product.
5.0,"Nice hose, easy to roll up and doesn't kink."
5.0,"5/8"" x 100' foot available at Walmart for $42.76... that's about $10 cheaper than AP, so had to go there.

It's a really good hose for the money.  Tuff and tangle free.  Well attached brass ends.  It's mostly PVC so it gets stiff below 45F, but is a tuff trouble free hose in warm weather."
5.0,"I just love these Flexogen hoses. No kinks!!! The big box stores in my area didn't carry a small size like this 15' one. It's perfect for my front porch, does the job and is easy to tuck away out of sight."
5.0,"love it i don't need to connect to other water hose.this what i need.good product so far.thank you,sofia"
4.0,ok
5.0,Good sturdy quality.
4.0,"This was a replacement for a ""lifetime"" hose from another manufacturer. The previous lifetime hose lasted about ten years. It did not like being wound on a hose caddy/reel. It kinked about 8 places in the 100 foot reel. It kinked so badly where the hose end screws into the hose reel that I had to hack off the end and replace it. The replacement lasted longer than the hose.
We've only been using the Flexogen for about a month. Baltimore weather decided to be February until early April. When, in early April, I wound it on the hose caddy/reel, it immediately developed some kinks (I didn't count them) as it was assiduously wound correctly, spread across the reel, etc.by its faithful servant, me. I think that kinking is unavoidable, given the 8-ply. The ideal reel for 8-ply is probably twice in diameter what the normal reel gives you (""normal"" assumes a crappy hose with no stiffness that you're going to replace soon). Lifetime hoses are too stiff for the usual reel.
So far, it has worked quite well. Though I saw kinks and we rarely unreel the whole 100 feet, water flow is excellent. The faucet end has a neat wire wrapping that will help keep it from kinking fatally where it screws into the hose reel. Both ends of the hose have really good whatchamacllit thread things -- high quality and sturdy."
4.0,"So far so good. Stiff hose but appears to handle high water pressure (100+/- psi) I ordered two of these hoses 2 months apart, one had a spring support near the female connector one did not."
5.0,It really works great. Can't go wrong.
5.0,"Very good planter for the small gardener.  I only have so
many bend overs left in my back and this product has sure saved
a few."
4.0,"Does a good job, needs a lot of seeds in the hopper or it skips."
5.0,"My wife won't stop smiling, this thing allows her to do in ONE minute what used to take 20 minutes of back-aching bent-over work. She loves using it. Excellent quality, versatile, great buy you won't regret."
5.0,Just got done using this to plant14 100' rows of corn in about 25 minutes and 3 100' rows of beans in about 10 minutes simply awsome amazing
5.0,Planting is a breeze with this seeder!
5.0,"Haven't used it yet, but think it will work great."
5.0,It saves my back when it comes to planting seed. It took me a fourth the time to plant the garden.
3.0,Hard to get the right plate for the seed sizes.
4.0,It works for well tilled soils
5.0,Getting ready to order another one - a 50 foot one this time!
5.0,Absolutely great garden hose. They last forever and they don't kink.
5.0,"I was looking to replace my 150' long black rubber hose with a lighter hose, that didn't kink, didn't get your hands black and if left in the sun didn't heat up the water in the hose. I researched every material available and decided on two 75' long hoses made of  Flexogen. The hose has not disappointed. It lays flat, is lightweight, dose not kink, the surface is smooth and clean, has a nice unobtrusive gray color, it looks very durable,  and the fittings do not leak.  Wat more could one want in a hose?"
1.0,"Bought these hoses due to ""the best hose you'll ever buy""  ""premium duty""  ""Lifetime Warranty""  blah blah blah. The very first time my wife tried to use one, it kinked and of course only a trickle of water. Here's the kicker: Any normal hose you'd just un kink it and life would go on. But no, not this hose. The kink is apparently permanent - the hose is simply collapsed at that point.
Don't waste your money."
5.0,Had it a couple months now and it's held up nicely. Harder to kink than most hoses. I would buy it again.
5.0,"For a serious gardener, this is a great choice.  I bought 2- 75 ft lengths  my hose reel holds 150 feet. The hose is well made and has excellent, water tight couplings with good spring protection for all the abuse and dragging around I will put it through.  It feels durable without being deadly heavy.  I water a green house and large vegetable garden daily and have gone through a lot of hoses over the years.  This hose was advertised as non-kink, but I've already had a couple of episodes when kinks happened.  However, I would describe this hose as very highly kink resistant, quickly unkinks once the hose is adjusted, and much more trouble free to haul around and operate than any other hose I've ever owned.  Careful storage, by winding your hose onto a  good quality hose reel is one of the best ways to prevent kinks and prolong the life of any hose.  This hose has been in use daily since March (located in Central VA)  and has gone through at least two times when night temperatures went down to 26 degrees  just fine.  I'm looking forward to seeing how well this hose will do through from October until mid December with use in grow tunnels.  I think it will work fine, but will report again later.  Highly recommend, especially if you water a lot."
2.0,"Mediocre at best, kinks and the hose has 'memory', bends and tends to stays that way, won't buy again. Should have made a trip to the local hardware store."
5.0,"Love it, good to go."
4.0,Works good and no kinks so far.
2.0,Great hose and obviously does what it is meant to.  I use it around the hose regularly but this hose kinks a lot which is super annoying because you have to constantly go find the kink.
1.0,"Well, this might work for some  folks but I think just blew 100 bucks.  Didn't cover the seeds or even plant onions. Guess I'll go back the old fashioned way."
5.0,"My earthway exceeded my expectation , I love it."
5.0,"I had one of these before  several years ago and it got stolen . Well I hadn't garden for long time after that. Now I'm back to it and just had to get another seeder to plant and to fertilizer spreader.  It is very easy to plant your seeds and too plant them in straight rows. The only problem is the row marker sometimes jumps around alot and you get a dotted line in the soil.  I put a bolt in the end of the marker for weight , now I get a straight line for the whole lenght of the row."
5.0,Just what the doctor ordered! Works great for my market garden.
5.0,".if you want to make your own seed plates for a seed that is not included in their sets,e.g, quoina, you'll have to order their BLANK SEED PLATE, part # 18106, from Earthway DIRECT.

You get the blank seed plates from Earthway. BUT THEY DON'T COME WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS. You'll have to contact Customer Service to have them e-mail you the instructions.

I've counseled them to start including the instructions with the plates."
5.0,This planter works great. Make sure your dirt is smooth and worked well . No lumps
4.0,"Seeder works decent.  Maybe a little more weight and some different handlebar geometry.  I'm 5'11"" and I had to bend down to use this.  After making many 80' rows, my back was sore.  Dropped seeds alright.  Had to lean seeder to the side to get the seeds to drop into the rotor pockets."
5.0,This was a gift for my son and he was very happy with it.
5.0,GREAT USEFUL PRODUCT
5.0,Just great!  I had one many years ago and this is even better built.
5.0,"Great hose, it doesn't bend or crimp easily like so many do.  We ordered it to replace an old, broken hose, and will be ordering another soon for the front yard.  We are pleased with this and glad to find it here, as we couldn't find one anywhere near this good locally."
5.0,No review
5.0,You will never have to buy another hose as long as your wife doesn't run over it with a lawnmower. I bought another one just like it but I also bought a splice kit so I'm still using the fourteen year old hose and waiting with a back up for the next time she mows. It is better than a good product.
5.0,"Great hose, can't say more!"
4.0,"Good hose for what it cost. It does leak from the attaching part no matter which faucet we attach it to and even replacing the O-ring did not help. We don't use hoses too often so that is not an issue for us. For a small town home where we just need to hose down a porch or sidewalk once in a while, this hose has been perfectly fine. We store it indoors so it should have a good lifespan."
4.0,"Haven't used yet, but weight is MUCH better for me.  Test will be in the 'no kinking'  department!  will follow up.  Love light gray color"
5.0,Love and ordering 2 more!
5.0,Nice heavy duty hose.
5.0,"Good hose, great warranty. One of the hoses developed bulges. Contacted Gilmour, was told to cut off ends and mail to them.
Less than a week, I received a brand new hose. Renewed my faith in warranties"
5.0,very well built starting works great the only downside is amazon says it's free shipping that is not true I paid a little over $17 for shipping
5.0,we are grateful for the time and energy this planter saves us and our friends.
5.0,It sure made gardening easier this year
5.0,"If you enjoy gardening this is an must have. My grandpa had one of these when I was a child, I remember using it during the gardening season, my parents still have it today. They are great quality, the new one I purchased is just like the one my grandpa bought over 60 years ago, that is just something you don't see anymore. Great heritage Earthway please keep it up."
5.0,works great
4.0,Came as promised. Works great.
4.0,Used to plant my garden works wonderful..
5.0,use it all the time
3.0,Broke wit the second use.
2.0,"Came well packaged, easy assembly. Does not work. I had one of these in the past, worked perfect for years but just got old and worn out.
The bar that measure distance broke off almost immediately, smaller seeds came out in patches as in every full turn instead of every notch. Larger seeds worked better.  It is in the shed now, will try it again next year maybe but not holding out hope."
1.0,This hose is only a few months old and it started to leak at the connection.  HORRIBLE... STAY AWAY.
5.0,"Great hose - strong but flexible, really good-looking!  dark grey, matches the color of our house.  Love it."
5.0,Very nice hose with excellent ends on it.
5.0,GOOD HOSE THANKS
5.0,"Exactly what i wanted. well built and good brass connectors, not cheap plastic."
1.0,At 40 degrees this hose is no more flexible than any typical plastic hose I've every owned. Disappointed buyer.
4.0,nice and flexible
5.0,Pretty quality hose.
4.0,"Good, but not as nice as the previous green color hoses it replaced."
4.0,"Good hose. I have had many Felxogen hoses over the years. BUT, the grey color is better suited for an industrial setting. PLEASE bring back the green garden hose for home use."
5.0,THESE ARE GREAT!!!
5.0,"We use this every year to plant our seeds.  We used to waste seeds, but the seeder doesn't waste."
4.0,Works well enough to save the back and plants evenly.
5.0,excelent produts an service
5.0,"My wife loves it, we planted 2 acres of corn withit and are considering the fertilizer attachment.
Well represented and shipped fast"
4.0,"Does the trick for most seeds.  Row marker works in perfect soil only, add a few rocks and conceptually it should be fine but its not!!"
5.0,All good!
5.0,I plant everything with mine and have so for many years it plants the seeds to close but  everyone I know comes dig plant when they are big enough for their garden the I just clear them out
2.0,"I have used this to sow fennel seed twice (120m), both times with basicially nil result. Admittedly this is my first use of it and the second time I changed the depth. I also wanted to use it for fava beans but have learnt it needs to used on fine tilth soil and at an even level to avoid variation in depth. After this investment (shipping to NZ) I will perserve and hopefully this is just a newbie glitch."
5.0,"Works wonderfully.  Better than bending over all day.  Trick is to move slow and pay close attention to the seeds dropping in the tube.  The aluminum construction is not heavy duty but as the instructions say, use in well tilled soil."
5.0,"Although I partially prefer pistol grip nozzles because of the control with one hand, this nozzle is a winner. I am using this because the pistol grip hoses always get caught like hooks for me as I drag the hose. I am not gentle with my hose and this nozzle does not mind one bit! The rubber is great quality and doesn't look any different after a couple months usage. This is not your typical Made in China throwaway. This will last for many years.

The spray patterns are also great, a variable controllable mist along with a great high pressure stream. I primarily wash my car and driveway with this."
5.0,"Durable, solid, good performance, just what I wanted.  No drips, seals well. I purchased this particular nozzle because the types with handles catch and snag when useing my hose reel.  It does an excellent job."
5.0,"I bought this excellent twist nozzle (#528) along with the Gilmour shut-off valve (#03VHF) and these two pieces working in tandem are perfect for not only the low pressure gentle watering of yard plants but also for high pressure spraying of vehicles, driveways, sidewalks, etc.  The solid brass construction and sturdy feel of the moving parts tell you right away that Gilmour has designed exceptional garden hose attachments which will last for years to come."
5.0,"This is the very best hose nozzle on the market.  I have tried everything else and there is no comparison.  Good old fashioned heavy brass with two O-rings and a silicon hose washer that does NOT LEAK.

You can not go wrong with this."
5.0,"Another Quality Gilmour Product

Whenever I've strayed and bought nozzles by other manufacturers, I've regretted it.  Gilmour solid brass nozzles are the best; I've never had one wear out, even after decades of use.  And, with the rubberized coating, twisting the nozzle to adjust the spray is a breeze, even if your hands are wet and muddy. These would be the nozzles of choice for anyone with arthritis or reduced hand strength (although, admittedly, they are not as aesthetically pleasing as the plain brass). The nozzle has been in use for nine years now and works just as well as the day it arrived."
5.0,"Excellent quality.  Most importantly, it works without giving one a shower in the process,  ASIN:B00002N68F Gilmour Solid Brass Twist Nozzle, #528.  Hopefully, it will last for at least a year."
5.0,Best garden hose you can buy.  Very flexible yet resists kinking.
4.0,"Great hose, very pliant material, I like it in every respect except for one.  Right out of the box, the plastic has a very strong smell that will stink up your house/room so much you will wonder if there was a chemical spill.  If you immediately put this outside / in the garage, you probably won't even notice."
5.0,Very sturdy looking hose.
4.0,Works well but still kinks on rare occasions. Good strong end fittings.
2.0,leaks after less than one year
5.0,"Good hose. been using it for 4 years now. Never once has kinked. Recommended

Recommend getting a hose reel for it as well, makes things so much easier"
5.0,Love these hoses.  Will never purchased another kind. The color is perfect for our home/yard
3.0,"The main connections leaks after a couple of uses, nothing major.  More of an annoyance than anything else."
4.0,Good heavy duty hose.  Stays flexible.
5.0,These guys make a good durable hose.
5.0,great machine for the money
5.0,Works well.  I have used it to plant my garden for 2 years and it works every time with no hassle.
2.0,Flimsy and mostly plastic.  Real gardening/farming tools are mush better made.
5.0,Good!
2.0,only good for a very small back yard no designed well.
5.0,"This is a great machine and is very easy to use.  The seeds that I planted are coming up in their general spacing from carrots up to beans.  The seed plate changing was confusing until I figured out what to hold and what to twist (operator error I am sure) but then it was a breeze to change the plates.  It made planting fun and I was sad that I couldn't plant more.  The optional plates don't seem to be needed for the average gardener but if you were planting enough to sell, they might be handy in being more seed specific."
5.0,"Planted 6 rows of bean seeds right off. Went the whole garden after That with corn . Never missed a seed. Love this little seed sower. made my work easy. I have a big garden , many rows on top of rows. Ill always have this to use."
5.0,I wish we would have known about this last year when we put our garden in.  So easy to use
5.0,"Several reviews on here complain about the light weight construction of this seeder but I have no problems with it.  It is built of light weight aluminum and plastis but I am sure it will last me a lifetime.  If your soil is freshly tilled and raked smooth you will have no problems.  I planted 4 30 foot rows of corn, 2 30 foot rows of carrots, and 1 30 foot row of bush beans in about 15 minutes.
I played around with the seed wheels to drop seed where I wanted it.  I put masking tape over some of the holes to space the seeds farther apart.  I am already looking forward to planting next years garden."
1.0,not worth buying. husband hated it. was going to plant a food plot said he couldn't get it do it's job. very cheaply made. I wouldn't waste my money.
5.0,"This is the only Amazon product I bought in 2004. I just now realized that it is eleven years old and it still works fine. Sometimes it kinks, but it has been used thousands of times under high pressure, my house has over 100 psi and couplings used to explode if you had a spray nozzle and didn't run to turn the hose bib off as soon as you were done spraying. Good, expensive hoses too. This one was different and still is."
2.0,"I am completely finished with this company.  let me tell you why.  I bought two new 100' hoses from this manufacturer.  they both went the same way, developing a hissing leak between the brass female end (the end that attaches to the hose bib) and the brass compression fitting that attaches to the hose, in  less than a year.  I ALWAYS leave my hose nozzles open to prevent any bursting, and in any case, you would expect the rubber part of the hose to fail.  When the first one went, Gilmour was good to their warranty and offered to replace it, providing that I cut off both ends of the hose and send them back.  So in order to have a functional hose while I was waiting, I would need to buy not one, but two hose repair ends (male and female), as well as spending the time to buy them and make the repair, as well as the cost of sending them back.  OK, I did it for the first hose (about $12 out of my pocket, plus the time), and they sent me another.  A few months later, the second one developed exactly the same problem at exactly the same spot.  And yes, they will replace it, with the same conditions.  I'd rather be able to buy a hose and have it work.  The warranty doesn't help when I need to use a hose.  Never again with this company."
5.0,"I have had this hose for 9 years.  It has withstood freezing temperatures, including the coldest winters we've had in 100 years.  It has been stretched, coiled, pulled around corners, stepped on, and generally abused as a garden hose can be.

It hasn't leaked.  It doesn't kink like other hoses I've had, and it outlasted the outdoor faucet it was attached to.

It is so good, I'm buying one for my relatives who just bought a house.
Excellent, excellent hose."
4.0,"This is my second hose of this type. While it is flexible and seems hearty, it cracked after two summers here in sunny California..it was close to the neck end. It was not used but maybe twice a week but I guess the hot sun got to it. I like the length and the non tangling aspect of this hose.

Oh and I forgot, it is pretty color...lol!"
4.0,Good hose that unkinks easily if it gets twisted.  I have it mounted on a hose reel. I like the outer layer of the hose; it is well built but not too stiff.  The hose is much better quality than what you find in a hardware or big box store.  I would purchase it again.
5.0,So far so good. hose has been used twice to do power washing jobs that lasted for well over 8 hours each time and it held up excellently. I would certainly recommend.
5.0,Works great.
5.0,"Works very well.  No real kinks, stands up to abuse and rolls up nicely."
5.0,No leaks and no crimps or tangles.
5.0,"This hose is well made, and the water doesn't smell like plastic when it comes out of the hose.  Would definitely recommend."
5.0,This is the second earth way planter that I have owned over the past 10 years. It is a real time saver. It plants anything frocavern to lettuce with no problem.
5.0,Works great definitely a back and time saver. And we'll worth the money would highly recommend to any one else
1.0,This seeder felt like a toy. It didn't have the weight to penetrate the ground. The mechanism did not reliably deliver seeds with the proper spacing. The row spacer flopped around and would not stay locked upright. Spend the money and get a better one.
4.0,"The only problem I ran into was one variety of corn had seeds that were to big for the plate. Other than that, it worked great and cut my planting time considerably."
5.0,Father in law had one over 30 years old. It was pretty beat up so I bought another. Except for a few improvements they are alike. the plates are the same which is great because he had a bunch that I didn't have to buy extra. He told me they were the cat's pajamas. He was right! It cuts planting time to a fraction
5.0,I would recommend this planter any serious gardener. It takes the work out of work. This the second one I have owned. I ran into my other one last year with my truck and had to plant 12 rows of corn by hand and it took me 3 days.this year it took me 20 minutes. The Planter  is well built well and very easy to use.
3.0,"It will work if you open the row with another implement so the soil is ""fluffy"" soft. The planter drive wheel is the front wheel. it is larger than the rear. To get the planter to operate, you have to put downward pressure on the front wheel. This causes the rear wheel, that is supposed to be compacting the seed, to rise and not touch the ground, therefore it does not compact the seed very well. Another gripe is the handle design. All the down force required to get it to work requires a firm grip on a sufficient handle. This unit has a very uncomfortable handle made out of bent aluminum bar stock. (My hands are designed to grip round objects, not bar stock). The poorly designed handles will allow me to grip them with only 3 of my fingers. Because I need a lot of down force to get it to operate, I need all of my hand on the handle, not just part of it. The seeds drop ok. It works in ideal soil conditions and for people younger than 66 that probably have less arthritis than I do in their hands. I almost put it up for sale on Craig's List, but decided it does have some use, and future, with limitations, for me."
3.0,Does just what it says and makes gardening a bit easier on the back. Nice neat rows and adjusts to different seed sizes.
4.0,Works well when hopper is half full to full otherwise you need to turn it to the side . I am happy with this planter planted 16 rows in less than 20 minutes.
5.0,"I planted everything but cucumbers,squash,and cantaloupes. The planter done excellent with sweet corn,but I had to tape up every other hole in the plates to space out string beans,butter beans, and okra. All in all it performed better than I expected."
1.0,"I wanted to return these the first time I used them, Amazon refunded me the money and said don't worry about the return. I want to respect that but also want to point out that these clippers are awful. If the one I got was defective I appologize to the company but after trying them out I was so insulted by the price and performance I got angry and had started the return.
I compare these to some $3 clippers of the same size from Walmart. These clippers snagged on themselves, were extremely stiff and ""choppy"". They couldn't make it through some of the most insignificant branches of my small shrubs and when left in the garage (even after cleaning) in one night they rusted so much I had to soak them in WD-40 before being able to get them to move again. After the soaking they look awful, perform very poorly and you should just pay a few dollars extra and get some Fiskars."
5.0,"The handles have rubber like grips that are quite comfortable to hold and your hands,  either bare or in gloves don't slip. The blades are extremely sharp and cut through my hedges with ease. I'm no Edward Scissorhands but I thought I did a great job thanks to a great tool. PLUS***** OMG SO SO CHEAP TOO in price not quality really you cant beat these at twice the price."
5.0,"This is definitely the best value for the money I paid. I have used it to cut tree branches (thin ones), shrubs, cacti etc. Does what it is supposed to. No complaints, good quality"
5.0,"I've used these Gilmour shears through two summers with light-moderate use.  They are sturdy, handle easily and are still sharp.  And, no problem with loose blades. I recommend them highly."
1.0,"This item can be labled as deceptive advertisement, as I view it. The product description on Amazon states that Gilmour has ""American made lawn and garden products"". I was searching for a hedge trimmer that was manufactured in the USA and was lead to believe that this product, made by Gilmour was manufactured in the US as well. Got the package, opened it up and stamped right on the blade, CHINA!!! Amazon needs to correct this product description, so that it doe's not imply that this product is made in the USA!! Gave a call to Gilmour and their rep. said that some of their products are made in the US and some in China. Then, they should not describe themselves as a US manufacture of lawn and garden products! Deceptive advertising as well, IMHO."
5.0,Simple Hedge trimmer that is easy to use and a great value. I recommend this product as it has served good use at my house!
4.0,"The gilmour hedge shears are comfortable to use due to the nonslip handles, bumpers and the sharpness of the blades. The blades are large and for adult use only.  The quality of the products should last for many seasons of use. One thing missing is a branch notch (used to cut hold)on the blade this would make the product complete. Overall I do recommend this shear to others to buy.  Have fun cutting."
5.0,"So far so good. I didn't thread the connector on properly and it was spraying out like crazy. Once I tightened the connector so that the o-ring is pressed against the tap, voila - excellent! Good, solid hose. I may get another one to add to it, if needed, but this is a good buy. You cannot go wrong with gilmour brand. So far I have had only good experience with these. Knock on wood ;)"
4.0,Hasn't kinked yet and threaded ends are well made.  If you need a shorter length hose; this is a good buy
5.0,"We bought two of these plus extra washers, and they work better than any hoses we have ever had. They are well made and with the lifetime warranty will be the last hoses we ever have to buy. Be sure and buy the extra washers as they keep any leaks from happening. Very pleased with company, sellers and product."
3.0,not a flexible as previous similar product. Kinks far to frequently
5.0,"Fantastic hose, great pricing and quick delivery"
5.0,Does the job
5.0,I bought this for an animal rescue shelter and they absolutely love it!
1.0,Constantly kinks
5.0,Great product!
3.0,"I've had the hose in service now for several months.  All of this time in hot weather.
Pros: very tough and hasn't kinked yet
Cons: very stiff and heavy even in hot weather.  Rather difficult to roll up even with no water pressure.
I'll try and do a followup after winter"
5.0,Where has this been all my life! Makes planting so easy. Love love love it! No more bending over each seed at a time. A 5yr old could plant an entire garden!
4.0,"I'm farming about an acre and a 1/2 and this worked out perfect for the different types of rows I put in.. The only downside is the spacer bar doesn't stay attached to the mounting hook when upright and had to fab up a velcro wrap for it.. but other then that no issues, an awesome tool."
4.0,"Unless you have really rocky soil. When it hits rocks of any size it tends to bumb around and mess up the row that you are planting.  In fairness, I have only used it once so far."
5.0,"The unit worked as we expected. We wer hand planting the garden, however with about an acre this year the seed planter planted in about an hour what we would have taken at least one day or more. The seed plates allowed the correct spacing of the seeds and we did not waste the seed as we have in the past."
4.0,"I found that with beets and peas, to use the next smaller sized seed plate, since if I used the seed plate listed for beets, too many seeds are dispersed, which results in some seed waste as there are more seedlings to thin out.  I used the radish seed plate for my next planting of seeds, and that worked much better.  For pea pods, I needed to use the ""small peas"" setting.  Using the large pea setting caused the plate to jam a bit, as too many seeds were getting into the slots, and the the seed would fly out of the hopper.  All in all though I am satisfied, as this will be a big time saver for me, and help to have straighter rows.  I'm not sure how I feel about the row marker yet though.  It is not that heavy, so it doesn't always leave a very big indent into the soil."
5.0,It is a great tool and saves on your back and time ! Make sure you have more seeds than you want to plant as the seeder needs plenty of seeds in the hopper to work right.
1.0,Not very useful overall and cumbersome to change settings. I think I wasted money here. Only benefit is to make your rows a little straighter. I ended up seeding by hand
4.0,"I LOOKED HERE FIRST, BUT FOUND IT FOR $85 on ebay. Too bad they don't check the competition. Should be cheaper here."
5.0,"Seeder went together rather easily, and the plate change is a simple twist. Tried to plant peas on day one, and it took 1/4 of the normal time to plant 200'. I will use this for all of my seeds going forward."
5.0,"Used for the first time this weekend. My husband says it paid for itself in the first two rows of sweet corn he planted. Sure saves your back and spaces and covers the seed nicely. Works great in our north Florida sandy soil.

Update: 8/23/16 Still happy and still using this garden seeder! I wouldn't be without it!"
5.0,good for watering the yard
5.0,The quality is great
5.0,Nice nozzle!
5.0,i foresee it lasting forever !!
5.0,Solid construction and comfortable to hold.
2.0,"Seemed solidly built, but it sprayed all over and could not be controlled. Would not buy again."
5.0,"Great Price, fast service"
4.0,Works great but the middle has moved slightly so it shoots more water out of one side of the tip but other then that I use it everyday and it does what it needs to.
4.0,"One is perfect, really perfect, great wonderful. I have tried many nozzles.  Well over a dozen.  The other sprays somewhat off to the side.  I would recommend with that warning."
5.0,"It does what it's supposed to do. it is simpler than the hand pistol grip sprayers which always seem to break down after a year or two. I have plenty of rubber washers, so hopefully this will last several years. Looks to be built durably."
5.0,"A good, strudy house that is not easy to kink or crush."
5.0,Excellent quality
5.0,"I started buying Flexogen Hoses at Ace Hardware some years ago, because the front of the package said ""This is the last hose you will ever buy.""  Well, I'm here to tell you, they are right.  I would never buy any other kind of hose again.

If there's one thing I can't abide it's a ""kink-free"" hose that kinks every time you use it. This hose is by far the least kinking hose on the market. It's incredibly easy to wrap back up on your carrier, or reel in un-kinked."
3.0,"This hose product would have received five stars, except for its poor manufacturer's packaging, which resulted in damaging the hose at one end. The hose is packaged in a coil, as one would expect, however, the hose end at the center of the coil was deliberately crimped sharply when the coiled was started. This may have caused permanent damage to that end of the hose, as now during use, the hose has a tendency to bend at that crimped place and restrict water flow. I am trying to rehabilitate that damaged part of the hose, but I don't know if it will ever function completely as it should, or as desired. The damage was completely avoidable, and probably affects every hose product this company packages in the same manner. It's just plain stupid."
2.0,"It was OK at first, relatively lightweight and OK for handling, but nothing special.  After a few years though the nice shiny green hose turned black with mold.  The outer casing seems to have little tolerance for being outdoors.  D'oh!"
4.0,Above average hose
5.0,"I purchased  this 50 foot hose mainly to wash my car (and save myself money on car washes). The hose is well made, came at a good price, and the shipping was very fast. No complaints"
1.0,"This hose is a kink monster.  It must have 4 or 5 pressure killing kinks in line right now, the polyurethane seems especially prone to kinking.  Funny, it's connected to my 12-year old Sears Premium black rubber hose that I purchased for half the price and it's holding up without any issues and I've even left it out during winter snows.  I will try to post a picture, but the hose that was shipped to me is not the same hose pictured.  Mine is light green and may be 8-ply, but it's the flimsiest 8-ply I've seen.

I think you can find better hoses for less money, look elsewhere."
4.0,"Somehow my original hose had one of the ends come off. Gilmour sent me another one, it took a while to get the replacement but it came and has held up well. I hate using the other cheapo hose I have compared to this one."
2.0,"Came early, looked great, broke in a week.  Hooked up to my hose reel and the part where the rubber hose meets the metal part that attatches to the faucet started to spray water in about a week.  I hate returning things and don't mind paying a little extra for things that will last, but when they break in a week #!!*.  I did ask for a replacement in hopes that this was a fluke.  In theory this hose had everything I needed in a hose, 500 psi, non kink, wide temp range, and life time garentee.  Lets hope the next one lives up to it's hype."
4.0,i chose this rating because i have not used it yet too much snow but according to the general construction of the planter whitch i consider to be adaquet for my use.
5.0,I bought this for my husband and he used it last spring to plant his vegetable garden. He loved it. He said it made planting so much easier.
5.0,"This precision garden seeder is one of the best tools you can buy for your garden whether its large or small. This thing will plant it and leave your grandpa's hand planting method in the dust! You will not regret buying this seeder. It is very comfortable in the hands and is easy to push through the soil due to the small plow on the bottom which also moves large and small clumps as well as debri out of the way so that your seeds are planted for success. Although I was skeptical at first as to how well it would work, I decided to buy it and try it out and I loved it. It makes me want to plant more and more, yet not enough open ground to plant so much hahaha! I definately recommend this earthway seeder. Makes planting fun and a breeze."
5.0,Ordered 5 pounds of sunflower seeds.  Do you k now how many sunflower seeds are in a 5-pound bag?  Arghhhhhh!  This seeder made planting 20 rows easy.
4.0,"I haven't had a chance to use this product as it is winter, but I assembled it and was impressed with all the features and the number of discs that came with the product."
5.0,"We have a small market garden. This seeder is our most valued and best tool we use. It has changed the way we garden and we have grown since owning this seeder. Get way more in,, in a small amount of time. Love it!!"
4.0,"I was told it would arrive on 13th Dec and on Jan 2nd told I had to pay 17.14 import VAT + 8 clearance fee from Parcel force.
It came from Germany. It arrived promptly the next day after paying.  Hidden costs should be more transparent. I might have bought it elsewhere for the extra 25"
5.0,The design is the same as 40 years ago and works as well as my mothers always has. Need to know how to use it though
4.0,"I used this to help me plant.  It gets only four stars because it is a bit fragile.  But knowing that makes using it without breaking down no real problem.  Just don't force when you occasionally get stuck.  It does the leave the planting is a nice row, evenly spaced.  And its variety of seed plates makes if flexible in your planting needs.  The price is great and I recommend it."
3.0,"I loved it for the sweet corn seeds, but was very disappointed when planting the smaller seeds.  The machine is not set up for one or two row applications.  It requires you to use far more seeds in the hopper than necessary otherwise the plates will not pick up the seeds."
4.0,"These work fine on green wood up to 1/2"" in diameter, but anything larger needs more leverage.  The lock is easy to use and very accessable, making one hand operations a breeze.  The best thing about these is that  they'll fit in your back pocket and stay locked.  I also have a ratcheting,  anvil style clipper that works much better on slightly larger twigs with  much less effort."
3.0,"The blades are sharp, the capacity is good, but the handle covers have a way of sliding off the handles in frequent use."
5.0,good quality product and unbeatable pricing
5.0,Great
1.0,"Looks good, but poor quality; does not keep a sharp edge. Used twice and dumped it."
5.0,The right tool for the right job. I like the thoughtfulness of the hole in the blade for hanging it on a hook or nail.
5.0,"Not a ton of leverage like others have mentioned, but it does the job for trimming grass and plants. Heavy duty."
5.0,makes fall cleanup so much easier
1.0,Total garbage. Rusted within a few weeks and I can't even use it.
5.0,"Great quality, lightweight, sharp blades."
5.0,Perfect for general yard work and trimming. Used on our small yard to trim back weeds and shrubs. Worth it!
5.0,They cut really good
4.0,First one leaked...the replacement one works great. Good heavy spray for cleaning and light spray for watering. Way sturdier than all the other ones we've had that were plastic and broke.
5.0,works great
1.0,"Looks are deceiving. It leaks out of the twist section. Unfortunately, I could not get to the project within 30 days and now I am stuck with an unusable nozzle."
5.0,"I bought this spray nozzle not expecting much for its price and lackluster review. So call me surprised when I opened up the package!

The nozzle has a hefty weight to it with a thick rubber grip to make it easier to twist open and close. The rubber grip definitely helps to prevent your hands from freezing compared to holding onto the bare metal nozzle. I also feel this has better flow control than the plastic trigger nozzles that I've used and replaced countless times. No more worrying about plastic triggers cracking and getting caught on the fence or vibes in the yard!

I have no worries about this breaking anytime soon. So far no leaks and cracks from abusive use."
5.0,"This is a super product, mush better quality than the one I replaced which was leaking. Very smooth when twisting the nozzle. The rubber is a great bonus."
4.0,So far so good
5.0,"This nozzle is awesome! Unlike the Powstro Metal Water Nozzle Hand Sprayer ""high pressure"" Nozzle 8 adjustable patterns, this heavy duty nozzle really performs like a champ, not like a piece of cheap plastic like the Powstro! Very well made."
5.0,"My husband said this is a great hose nozzle.  Good stream of water, well made.  Doesnt leak.  Recommend"
5.0,"Works great, very high quality construction.  Much better than your average water nozzle."
5.0,Works well. Great for the price.
2.0,Hose is nicely built but prone to kinks when extended.
1.0,"This hose burst after 2 days. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to hook it up and try it until after the return window. My  previous run of the mill hose that cost me 1/2 as much as this one lasted years. VERY disappointed.
I also can not find any information on the supposed lifetime warranty on their website. AND their contact us form is broken."
5.0,This hose is certainly worth the money. I have a few of them and would never again buy one of those Chinese cheapies. Spend the extra $$ this is the best hose you can ever own.
5.0,Nice hose.  Convenient size
5.0,"Really, really good quality hose"
5.0,Thanks.........
2.0,"Kinks, does not roll up easily, and has burst twice at the nozzle. Claims to have lifetime warranty but their website is non existant."
5.0,Great hose!
5.0,"I love these hoses, my wife can handle them with out any problem, therefore if she is happy I am happy.
A great value."
2.0,Kinks all the time!
4.0,Is a good machine I found that I use it in more elaborate than it did land but its performance and operation was expected
4.0,"Simple to use, effective with a broad range of different seeds, I use it for my commercial trials, in my vegetable seed operation.  It is particularly effective for Brassica seeds, had good success with spinach also"
2.0,"I gave this seeder 2 stars, not because it doesn't work.  It does work.  I don't like the seeder because I have to fill the seed hopper for it to work.  I don't buy that many seeds to be able to fill the hopper full.  The seed plates turn in the hopper vertically.  They catch a seed and bring it up and release it at the top of the hopper so the seed can fall into the ground.  If you don't have enough seeds in the hopper, the eyelets in the seed plate can go unoccupied and it will skip.  If you plant a huge garden with long rows of a given veggie, then you can fill the hopper with seed and go.  It will work perfectly for you."
4.0,"Works very well in soft tilled garden! Cut our time in half, well more than half! Great time saver and good quality"
5.0,Tested it once it arrived seems like it will work next season.  Haven't used it for any amount of time yet but looks like it will be exactly what was looking for
1.0,"Overall, it's cheap and doesn't work well.  The cups in the seed plates are at such an angle that the seed plate rolls up over the seeds grinding and breaking them up.  You also have to be careful that you don't put too many seeds in the hopper, or they are caught by the edgd ot the plate and ground up.
When planting corn, beans, or peas, the unit sounds like a popcorn popper with all of the seeds getting caught behind the plate.  The chute, that is supposed to catch the seeds when they exit the plate, is cheap and pulls away from the side of the hopper.  This allows any seeds that make it past the plate, to fall all over the ground.  For small seeds, the planter is useless.  Save your money and try to hire the neighbor kid to plant your seeds for you."
3.0,"This was pretty easy to assemble and seemed intuitive to work.  However, it didn't drop seeds as consistently as I would have liked and occasionally it dropped two seeds instead of one.  Yes, I did have the right plate installed according to the included instructions.  It helps some with planting but still requires some hands and knees time to straighten out the misdropped seeds."
5.0,The Earthway is a very effective means to sow seeds. It has saved me alot of time and produced great crops!
4.0,Tried this out today.  I was a little uncertain that it was seeding properly but I think it did.  Seed plates take a bit of getting used to.  I'd recommend using a seed plate that is about 1.5 times larger than your seed.
5.0,"Firstly would recommend the product to every New Zealand Gardener.
We were on a 6 week vacation in the USA and Canada, people recommended we buy via Amazon this product and get it freighted home. Rather than carry it around as airline carry on baggage. It was the best decision. Was here in 12 days to my family. It has been assembled and admired by friends and family. But alas it is the middle of winter and is months before it is used.
Thanks to Amazon for the transaction. Great."
5.0,"The soft grip handle are comfortable in your hands. Very good cutting blades. I will recommend this product to family and friends. The ""Gilmour Hedge 8 inch"" is light weight making trimming very easy and you spend less time trimming. A very great product."
4.0,Love these they do the job.  Very sharp.
5.0,Great clippers for a low cost. I have a small yard and these clippers make it simple to keep up on yard work!
5.0,works great.  My yard looks nice now.
5.0,Handy
5.0,"Great for small buses and quick jobs. My bushes are very small- they stand about 1ft tall. These Wouldnt be good for bigger bushes , with thicker branches. Works for what I need!"
5.0,I use this product for trimming large hedges and small plants.  Its Sharp light and works well
5.0,Great!  I clipped my hedges with these.  For thick branches needed to use some extra force
4.0,These are fantastic!  They easily our hedges! They even cut right through the overgrown branches of our citrus trees!
3.0,"not very sharp, had to work at it to trim blossim ends from BASIL plants in the garden"
5.0,Excellent ! No leaking nozzle and a great spray pattern . . .
4.0,WORKED  WELL  FOR  A  SHORT  TIME
5.0,It just  works
4.0,Good quality - teamed it up with the Conti rubber hose.
5.0,great adjustable spray and no leaks.  solid nozzle
5.0,Just as described!
5.0,Terrific nozzle -- doesn't leak at all and really good at directing the flow.
5.0,finally a hose sprayer that works! Its very powerful so it makes cleaning the deck easy and fast. Yes it's steel and yes it's heavy duty
4.0,There is no nozzle that I have not bought. And I truly mean none. We have extremely low water pressure probably because our house is like 100 years old and the pipes are old. Anyway found this nozzle and hey I never tried this one. It is by far the best one yet. It has increased my water pressure and is easy for me to turn right and left because I am always changing the speed of my nozzles. I just hope these ones don't break in under a year like every single other one that I purchased here on Amazon. These appear to be very good quality but like I said if they last longer then a year I will be pleasantly surprised to find a well made product.
5.0,"So far so good, it is working really well."
5.0,"Not the cheapest hose I've ever bought (Hint: buy in the off season when the price goes down) but certainly the best.  I was so happy with the first one, I bought another one and gave away my old, cheap hoses.  I have a 150 foot lot, and now when I drag hoses around, they don't get kinked up every five steps."
5.0,Great hose for price
5.0,"I have a very high pressure on my outside hydrant, so high that all other hoses I have used have eventually ruptured under use.  Heat also contributed in that they ruptured during the summer while laying in the sun.  I have purchased two of these, the first in July 2012 and the second a year later.  So far there has been absolutely no problem with either hose."
4.0,"Very good hose for a good price, and made in the USA. It's not approved for drinking, but most people know that (in general) garden hoses are not safe to drink from. The only drawback is that it softens in the heat and stiffens in the cold. You can buy an ""industrial grade"" Gilmour rubber hose that is better in this regard, but at nearly twice the price. This is a great hose for most applications, with quality fittings and construction."
5.0,Great hose. No cracks/tears etc after over a year of use. Still looks new.
5.0,"This hose so far works great.  It does kink a little bit, but only if you are pulling it at an angle.  The hose also coils up really nice and doesn't kink while it coils.  I'll order another one for the front yard."
5.0,"I purchased this due to its 8-ply feature hoping it would hold up to the planned abuse I had in store.  I was pressure washing areas around the entrance to our subdivision which required the hose to be subjected to vehicular traffic on an asphalt roadway.  During the 5 hours the hose was stretched across the road dozens of vehicles drove over it (probably near 100), including a UPS delivery truck and a school bus.  After the job was completed the hose coiled up perfectly, and I noticed no appreciable wear.  Rugged!"
2.0,It squirts water out of the top closest to the water faucet.
5.0,great hose
5.0,It Is a great product . I bought 2 and I will buy it again.
4.0,water hose
5.0,ok
4.0,Easy grip and control hose nozzle made out of brass and covered in a rubber product. A strong spray and a gentle spray by simply twisting the nozzle end. Fits the hand comfortably.
5.0,It's not often that something so simple can be so impressive.  After years and years of so-so nozzles I could almost hear music in the background when I first used this nozzle.  It turns on and off with precision.  When it's off there is no dripping and when it's on the spray pattern is consistent and repeatable.  I have ordered a couple more to replace my other nozzles.
5.0,Nice nozzle...Best I've used of this type...DD
5.0,These have worked the best for me after trying many others. Nice spray. Doesn't jam when tisting. Comes off the hose if necessary (some others get stuck). The rubber type shell helps if you have 100 degree days; The pure brass type get too hot to twist w/o gloves.
5.0,"Works great, and priced right.."
5.0,Very sturdy - I believe  it will last for many years to come. Comfortable hand feel and various width of spray. Very strong. True brass construction. I highly recommend.
5.0,"Nice, works well."
5.0,"Works well, no problems, works as advertised with no real negative.

I like the coating on it, compared with the cheaper version- helps make it easier to turn + less hot if in sun."
5.0,"Durable,  easy to work with and sharp enough to attend to some shrubs that appeared to be neglected for years.  The shrubs have met their match. Do recommend"
5.0,They are very sharp do a great job
5.0,"Love these!  They are lightweight, and maintain an edge reasonably well.  The 5 stars are given for the lightweightedness and price per quality.  Naturally, there are better Hedge shears out there, but you pay much much more money.  These are good for the homeowner, but I wouldn't recommend them for a landscaping business.."
5.0,"Only have light uses for this, but it's holding up well, keeping it's edge with some tough cutting.  Good value/"
1.0,By Far this is the worst product i have bought from Amazon. The sharpness of the Blades is so bad that it does not even cut a small plant let alone big hedges. I wish i could just return it.
1.0,Not recommended
4.0,Great quality. Tool works fantastic.
5.0,Can't beat it for the price. Very sharp and cut my hedges with ease.
5.0,The blades cut nicely.  The weight is just right.  I recommend them!
5.0,Zero quality issues. Work well.
4.0,"I have had the Earthway Precision Garden Seeder since the spring of 2011.  The unit performs well in light, well tilled loam.  The seeder does not do well in heavy soil that has not been broken into small pieces.  Very seldom has my garden soil had the ideal consistency for this seeder.  However, I still manage to get the garden seeded with less effort than I would without the seeder.  You will not be sorry you bought it if you recognize its limitations.  The six seed plates that it came with meet my needs.

 I gave this 4-stars because it is not perfect, but better than anything else for the price.  I would recommend the seeder to anyone who has a garden larger than 1200 square feet, and wants to save a bit of time."
5.0,Totally love it. No gardener should be without one. I planted my whole garden in one afternoon and only takes but a couple minutes to plant a row.
2.0,"We tried planting kale and beans with this and did not have much success.  With the kale, even with the correct insert, the seeds were ground to a pulp, we only had 2 plants grow. We tried 5 different varieties of beans after the first planting, the seeds came up very scarce only about 1/6 of what was planted. We reseeded right next to the first row and still got horrible germination. This is great as a row marker, but we have yet to be successful using it as a seeder."
5.0,"This was a great purchase.  My father has owned an Earthway planter for years.  I borrowed it for 2012 garden planting, but knew I wanted my own.  This product works as expected!"
5.0,It made short work of planting.  I liked the ease of working it and changing the plates.  I used it to plant deer food plots.  Transporting it was easy.  My wife used it and raved about it.
5.0,for our size garden it works greart!! It saves my back from all the bending required to plant rows of seeds
5.0,My man really appreciated it.. he doesn't  have to borrow the neighbors anymore.. .easy to put together and works great
5.0,"This device is the best for planting corn accurately - good spacing, straight rows, proper depth of seed.
Excellent for small vegetable gardens"
5.0,This Garden Seeder works great.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I depended on the reviews on Amazon and was not disappointed.
4.0,"Pros:
-Easy to adjust row markers and seed depth
-Easy to swap out seed plates
-Saves a considerable amount of labor versus hand seeding.

Cons/potential improvements:
-Handle is lightweight aluminum.  Good for weight, bad for rigidity.  Wobbles some when pushed through heavier soils.
-Row marker could use marks indicating common row spacings.  I used a sharpie to mark 30"" and 20"".
-Stand could be wider/taller.  Seeder has a tendency to fall over if not on a perfectly flat and level surface.

Usage notes:
-As others have said, soil prep is essential, especially if you have a heavy soil
-After you put in your seed, turn the wheel by hand a couple turns to make sure the cup picks up one (and only one) seed.  If it doesn't, experiment with other seed plates to find one that works (and has approximately the correct spacing)
-Keep a cloth handy to clean between the seed plate and the container -- if dirt gets in there, it will bind up and cause problems"
1.0,"Kinks in a most aggravating way and too expensive. The warmer it is, the more it kinks."
5.0,great
5.0,"If you want a MUCH better hose than some of the Big Box stores offer, at about the same price--Buy this hose! The last one I bought at a Big Box store, the cover split when I ran over it with my car ONCE, the week I bought it."
5.0,item sent to someone else
5.0,This a good hose that doesn't kink. I wish I had purchased a longer one.
4.0,"Holding up nice, hard to kink this hose"
5.0,totally satisfied
5.0,"2015 - Great price & great quality.  Works for me.

2018 - Ok... updating my review.  Awesome product.  Purchase a 100 ft hose with a lot of use and still going strong.  I now need to replace a 15 year hose and will buy this same product again."
5.0,I love it.  It doesn't knot when pulled.  Very well made and it seems to be sun resistant.  I have had it in the yard and in the sun for 5 months and all is well.
5.0,works great so far
5.0,"I would highly recommend this nozzle. It is sturdy and rust proof, and the water stream works great for washing cars. Very high quality."
5.0,Gone through several different kinds of nozzles and sprayers.  THIS IS THE ONE!  Best ever.
3.0,"Hard to hold ant turns too easy, changing my spray pattern or shutting off when I don't want it to. Heavy duty though. Bad design."
5.0,"Great so far. I've had it for 4 months now, left attached to my hose outside. Appears to hold up well, I was worried about the rubber deteriorating with  being left in the sun. Its on the west wall, so it gets the afternoon sun direct. I live in Florida and it got a nice mix of heavy rain and hot sun daily this summer and it's not changed one bit. I know its not a terribly long time yet, but I've had other various material nozzles from walmart basically fall apart in that time frame from the weather. I will update this review if/when the thing breaks or shows abnormal wear. So far, It's worth a couple bucks extra for this."
5.0,"brother told me to buy this nozzle for my hose, couldn't be happier, it really kicks! lol i was gonna get the cheaper one without the rubber but im glad i got this one, its VERY durable, don't buy that crap in the stores, seriously buy this thing"
5.0,Works like it's on ball bearings. Smooth
5.0,"This nozzle is great!  I bought two of them.  It is built to last!  No plastic parts to break on this guy, it'll last forever!"
5.0,"It's a great sprayer, cleans my patio good enough that I'd let my neighbors eat off it..."
5.0,"Simple design, does the job, Seems to be well built"
5.0,"Nice and simple!  My spray nozzle with different spray settings fell apart after 2-3 years of use, so i decided to try this type.  I was a bit afraid i would have to go buy an extra piece for the turn off valve, but there's no need.  When i tighten it all the way, the nozzle shuts off the water.  As i loosen, it goes in a fine spray to a jet to just water running out at the most open setting.  I'm happy with this purchase."
3.0,Not as heavy as i thought iy would be. Works ok .
5.0,These do the job just fine.
5.0,Good basic hedge trimmer.  Sharp blades cut well.
4.0,Cuts well
4.0,"A bit weak on cutting thicker branches when compared to a smaller one I have. But for the price and light trimming, it is great."
5.0,"Perfect Hedge Trimmers.  [ASIN:B00002N678 Gilmour Basic Hedge 8-Inch Coated Blades 8]  So happy I bought a new yard tool for once. The trimmer is fairly light, very sharp and a breeze to use. I trimmed my plants so much (really needed it) my neighbors were going to hide it from me! My yard does look wonderful now. (I think they are jealous!)"
4.0,"Easy-to-use, smooth action. Only used on a Jasmine vine. Have not tried on anything thicker."
5.0,Very nice.
5.0,Great price. Love the rubber bumper stops when closing. Very comfortable handles. Light weight.
1.0,Did not perform well not very sharp.  Returned
1.0,Very disappointed. Wasnt very sharp. Had a hard time cutting my headges.
3.0,Makes planting alot quicker..only down fall is when seed hopper gets low it doesn't pick up the seeds. Amazon was great to deal with.
5.0,Did just what I wanted. Makes gardening so much easier. Even spacing of seeds planted at the right depth and covered after planting. What more could you ask?
5.0,"I bought one of these 20 years ago and gave it away to a friend about 15 years ago. He still uses it every year for his very large garden so I bought another one. It will take a couple of years of gardening to pay for this puppy but thee is no question that will plant better, faster, more consistently, and with a lot less back ache. Well made and ingenious in it's design. has adjustments for depth of planting, row spacing and seed size/spacing. The only problems I have had are trying to plant very large seeds like Ford Hooks and trying to plant on lumpy, uneven, or hard soil. the seed bed needs to be well tilled and level for good results."
5.0,"Great tool, wouldn't garden without it. I've been using one of these for about 7-8 years and it makes gardening easy. I have a large garden and raise a lot of sweet corn. It's especially good with corn and beans. I have two different size corn plates, one plants close and the other plants farther apart. The one plate takes garger grain than the other. The larger grain using the smaller plate is the reason why seed gets stuck in the holes and pops out or jams the seeder. It's also great for beans. I used it for the first time this year for cucumbers and it plants them very or too close but all you have to do is walk through and thin them out. It's kinda hard to use in sod ground because the shoe keeps picking up the sod. Ground needs to be well tilled. I love mine ,in fact I have two of them.  I don't care for the marker that comes with it , I like to string off my rows and make them a little wider and straighter. Alan Bane"
4.0,The seeder worked as expected in good clean soil and also performed in an acceptable fashion in harder soil conditions.
1.0,The seed plate kept falling out. Seeds didn't feed through consistently and the spacing mechanism would not stay in the locked position as I wanted. I spent more time fiddling with the two small blocks I wanted to plant than if I did it by hand.
3.0,"If you have a ""clean "" freshly tilled garden , by clean I mean , no grass roots and not many rocks or mulch. it worked pretty good. However if your garden is not so clean, it was not the best. the row marker is held on with a plastic pin and that immediately broke after a few minutes. i will get a bolt and nut and repair it. this was my first time using it and it was a new garden area so i don't want to be to hard on it."
5.0,"just what i needed for gardening  made planting easier ,love it ,easy to use would recommend to any one with little time"
5.0,It will really save my back in many ways.  Lightweight and easy to carry around.  easy to change seed plates and they are marked very well as to what seed to use.  I would recommend to anyone/
2.0,"I have a 10 row, 100' long garden and needed a better way to plant seeds.  What I found is that the seeds are not dropped uniformly and tend to pop out of the bin like a pop corn machine.  I put plastic over the bin to hold them in but then you can't see if the seeds are being picked up by the plate.  I have tried it for two years and I'll have three seeds drop in one place and then none for eight feet or so.  The plate becomes loose and seeds get lodged behind the plate.  Your soil has to be perfectly tilled with no lumps, debris or rocks.  In a perfect world it might work, but I don't live in a perfect world.
If you get this device you'd better have a lot of patience and determination to make it work properly.  Mine is for sale on Craig's list if you still want to buy one."
5.0,Very well made. Sturdy.
5.0,"This nozzle works great.  It can range from no water, to a wide fine mist to a tight stream and back easily.  I purchased it for cleaning my cartridge filers for my pool.  I needed something that provided a tight hard water stream.  This suits that purpose nicely."
5.0,"solid, heavy duty, no leakage, smooth"
5.0,"sturdy comfortable grip, love it."
5.0,This nozzle is very good. No leaking and it adjusts easily. It is constructed of two solid pieces of brass. The outer piece screws over the inner piece to adjust the spray. The black material over the brass is to enhance gripping the nozzle. It is much better than plastic nozzles and I like it better than other brass nozzles I have owned.
5.0,Good nozzle. Has a uniformly round spray pattern and shuts of completely.
5.0,High quality nozzle. Works perfect with no leaks.
5.0,Good quality nozzle
5.0,Love this - not too large or heavy in the hand. Will buy again
5.0,Gilmour is a great yard brand and happy to find on amazon at a good price.  Does NOT leak!
3.0,"They are not very sharp, some grass it won't cut."
2.0,cheap blades bent right away
5.0,"Super sharp trimmers cut all the tall weeds behind our fence with one swoop. I tried to cut some 1/2""+ stems and couldn't get through them but that was expected.  Seem like they will last a long time."
1.0,The product description says that these hedge shears are manufactured in the US. They are not. They are manufactured in China.
5.0,"I pick this particular blade because it was the cheapest option with highest rating/reviews. So far, I concur."
1.0,While using blade began to twist and become manipulated till it was pointless to conrimue using. Threw it away.
5.0,Very sharp and comfortable to use
5.0,Nice and sharp!
5.0,"Sharp and a lifetime warranty, what else can you ask for?"
5.0,Excellent product!  Cuts well.  Bought it for overgrown rose bushes.
5.0,"Excellent quality and materials, very recommended!"
5.0,"It came as advertised, I was looking for a good heavy duty gardening and multitask hose, and I found it.  The hose never kink and easy to handle.  Actually, I was surprise it was light.  I will give an update in 3 months.  For now, I am glad I choose this hose."
5.0,Wonderful hose bought many of these.
5.0,Had it for about a month now.  It remains flexible so far in the hot summer sun.  Waiting to see if it does so once the weather turns cool
5.0,heavy and well made hose love it
5.0,Great hose bought 5.  Home Depot is suppose to have them in stores cheaper.
5.0,This may be the best garden hose made. If not it is very close.
2.0,"This is well made but not very flexible, so it's difficult to keep it pointed in the direction you want."
4.0,4 stars because this hose is really heavy.  Wish I had got the light weight one.
5.0,"I believe this is the best hose you can buy for your garden/lawn. However, let me be honest, ALL HOSES WILL KINK but these do it much more seldom than most and only after the summer sun has got them warm/hot. I have 3 each, 100 foot and will order another shorter one soon. They are extremely durable and worth the few dollars more. I had some in Central Asia (long story) where the summer sun was a constant 105-120F and they held up with no problems unlike their predecessors. Again, I believe this is the best hose for your money, reliable and durable. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"This seeder is more geared toward ""garden planting"" than it is ""larger 'food-plot' planting"".

I had about 1/2 acre of corn to plant in two food plots.  Without a heavy planter, I tried this garden seeder.  In it's defense, it DID save a whole bunch of time over trying to plant/cover in rows by hand.  HOWEVER... the ground was not ""perfect garden ground""... it was a field which had been worked a number of times with a tractor/disc.  The unevenness/bumpiness of the ground made working with the seeder difficult.  The rate at which it dropped seed would vary greatly and the ""covering chain"" often would not cover the seed.

I'd say IF you have ""perfect garden ground"" (sort of like a bag of loose ""top soil type"" dirt for your entire corn planting area), this planter will work much better (maybe making it a 4-5 star review).  The IDEA and the DESIGN make sense... but in anything other than an ideal soil situation... this planter isn't going to perform as it's intended.

I used the seeder for one field.  For the other field, I hand broadcasted the seed corn... than lightly went over it with tractor/disc.  We'll see which one turns out best.  If the field using the seeder turns out best, I'll use it for everything next year.

Good luck!

PS:  (someone DID walk behind the seeder and tried to scuff some dirt over the seed it left exposed)"
1.0,Basically bought the planter to plant sweet corn.  Seed plate does a very poor job of picking up seed and getting it to the drop area.  Seeds pop out of the cups and if you are lucky you get a seed to drop every 10-12 inches.  I would recommend hand planting over this device.
5.0,made for a quick nice garden planting this year but its hard to know if seeds are actually coming out; especially the small ones like carrots .... so i'll know more in a week or two if something actually comes up!  fun to use though.
3.0,"I like that the seeder has a row marker and that it adjusts depth for different seeds, but wish it came with the extra seed plates because the extra ones seem to be the most common seeds that are sown directly into the ground. The seed plates included were limiting in what could be planted straight into the garden. Otherwise pretty happy with this product."
4.0,"Your soil better be sandy because if it's clay, it will be extremely hard to push and set any seed to a depth below 1/2 inch.  Overall, happy with it though."
4.0,I love my garden but have a hard time bending to plant the seeds. This seeder is GREAT. I am able to plant the seeds in a short amount of time with no effort. I purchased the optional seed plates also so I have a variety of plantings available to me.
5.0,This planter will save alot of time and effort. Easy to assemble and would recommend it to anyone who has a garden or is planning on starting one.
3.0,"The 6 seed plates do not lock in place. If you roll it backwards, the plate will fall off. Otherwise it's a great product. My corn has been growing for 3 weeks now."
5.0,"Love that seeder cause, I don't have to been over to plant the seed!!!!LoveIt,Saves my Back! Thank U very much!!!!!!!!!!"
3.0,"Shipment was fast and planter was easy to assemble.  I have only used it to plant corn and it worked okay in the food plots that were clean and had soft or sandy soil.  If there was any debris on the ground it would catch on the V plow and cause the planter to not open the trench for the seed to drop into.  Also it frequently dropped two seeds at the same time.  Not sure why.  In summary it works okay in very clean soft ground.  Was of no use in plowed areas with ANY trash mixed in the soil.  This planter might be good for home garden applications but did not do the job I was hoping for in helping me plant wild game food plots.  While most of my plots have soft or sandy soil, they will not be totally clean of any old plant debris."
5.0,high quality and functional for the cost. Will find out how durable over time.
5.0,Good product
5.0,comfortable to use and turns off completely.
5.0,It's a generic hose nozzle.  Gets the job done.  The rubber coating is nice.
5.0,Great
4.0,Seems reliable; time will tell. Definitely prefer this to what I find at a local store.
5.0,Easy to use. Doest leak. Jet stream is solid. The cone spray is great for the car.
5.0,Great!
5.0,"Well made. The rubberized feature makes for comfortable handling without usage. Can close a door/lid on it (I use it for a fish well in my boat) without damaging a surface/edge. Would buy again.

ps. Been through a million plastic nozzles...no more."
5.0,"You cannot beat this nozzle for quality or price, works great for hosing off the porch or sidewalk....or just watering flowers. Very Happy!!"
5.0,"GREAT ZOMBIE KILLERS! Very sharp, cuts easy"
4.0,Sharp and light weight are definitely a plus. Would go with something bigger than 8in blades next time.
1.0,Product arrived extremely blunt at the front (useful part to cut with) with OK cutting in the back quarter. That wasn't the biggest problem; these blades bent like cheap tin.
5.0,works real good
1.0,should have returned it.  my old craftsman from 1979 is better than this.
3.0,"These are essentially a large pair of scissors.  They are sharp and cut smallish, softish things very well.  Think shrubbery.  They ARE NOT good for anything else.  There are no ridges so anything hard or easily flexible (eg: reaching to trim near the end of a branch) just slides out.  There is no cam action to lever through ""heavier"" branches (when I say 'heavier' think 'pinky' size).  Similarly, there is no notch at the base of the blade to catch and hold harder branches to allow the blades to cut.

If you only need to trim bushes / shrubs of the small to medium variety, these are nice, sharp, easy to use shears.
But they are wholly unsuitable for anything remotely heavy duty.  Tree branches the 2/3rd the size of my pinky took 5-8 sawing cuts to sever.  Anything bigger than that is hopeless."
5.0,Perfect size and they work great.
1.0,"Made in China, clearly states United States in description."
5.0,Great Working.!
5.0,Very sharp and make it extremely easy to trim.
5.0,Hopefully it'll hold up the AZ heat. We shall see. Anything is better than the expandable garden hose. The hubs bought two and they didn't last long. I'm hoping it was worth it to up the price for better quality.
5.0,Works well and dependable.
5.0,A well made hose as the price would indicate.  I have it placed under mulch and time will tell how long it lasts in that application.
3.0,Nice hose... But it will kink. I've begun to think ALL hoses kink. LOL
2.0,Kinks and is heavy
5.0,"It's a long hose. It transports water from the spigot to the place you want it to go.
Isn't effective for whipping people or otherwise. Too heavy to swing it that way.
Will kink but not often. No holes found in it except for the ones on either end.
Water arrives at desired location as expected."
5.0,"Excellent quality and meets my expectations and needs of a short water house. I will buy it again if the need arises in the future. For the record, I had never heard of this brand, so it was a blind purchase. Solely based my decision in purchasing this water house on the positive feedback that this water hose received."
3.0,Ask me in 10 years. Right now.......way too soon to tell !
3.0,Hose will kink easily!
3.0,Hose will kink easily!
5.0,"If it breaks I'll buy it again. And again.
Does all smaller hedge jobs without hesitation. Blades stay sharp and cut clean.
May not be good for anything more substantial like old vine.
Great for boxwood, raspberries, blackberries, junipers, arborvitae, probably all other softer bushes."
4.0,"For the price, great buy. Works great and strong enough to handle the job. Recommend you try them.
Also, fast shipping"
3.0,some of the thicker brush bent the blades the first time using them :(
1.0,These bent after the second use on a shrub branch about the size of my index finger.
3.0,"For the DIYer that has a small yard and doesnt make financial sense to hire a gardener for simple yard tasks. I purchased this to cut down overgrown weeds that was taking over my driveway. Maybe this isn't what its used for but I had to use much of my physical strength to cut a 1 inch diameter stem. It didn't work on the base stem, I got tired, overgrown Weed Bush = 1, me = 0. Luckily my neighbor was kind enough to use brute strength after seeing my struggle to actually pull the 6ft bush out of my driveway."
4.0,Just your basic garden shears - works fine.
5.0,The milkweed jungle in my backyard was obliterated in under an hour. I have a yard now!
5.0,"Haven't used it much; but, I like the padded handles and works fine so far. A good upgrade from my previous hedge clippers."
1.0,Junk - barely cut anything and rust like crazy - Coated? Where?
1.0,"This product collapsed the first time I put any real pressure on it.  I'm not the Hulk, and these things folded quicker than a playing card inserted into a high-speed origami machine..."
5.0,Awesome product. Only needs 1/2 twist to go from off to full pressure dream with great control on 'spray'. The twist is smooth any effortless. Great for here in California where water is precious. When washing a car you can turn off with one twist.
1.0,it is bare brass not padded as described. can not be adjusted to a single stream with out a lot of over spray. Poorly made
5.0,Well designed for easy handling. Appears durable.
3.0,Will rate again later not much pressure out of it going to switch nozzles and see what happens
4.0,"Built well, looks good, not precision enough, good value"
5.0,"Perfectly made, works great--same as old time ones!"
5.0,Very good! I bought a much more expensive one from Sears a few years ago and this seems to be the same exact quality. I still have the one from Sears but wanted another one for the front yard. These really last and have many settings including a real powerful one for blasting dirt. It's not a power washer but it's very strong.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,good
1.0,"Purchased this back in 2014 and I have had two issues with it. First of all, it recently broke where the female coupling that attaches to the hose attaches to the nozzle body, for some reason it just separated. There are some threads on the piece right there where it somehow joins the two parts together and they just came apart. Impossible to put this back together correctly so it is junk at this point. Secondly, the spray pattern is weird when you turn it on. Rather than going from a nice spray to a more forceful one, it first goes into a pinpoint, hard spray pattern first, then to a nice open spray, and then to the full spray. I've never had a nozzle that did that and I really never liked that. Giving it one start since it lasted all of 2 years. Not sure what their warranty is but I am checking that out now."
5.0,"We use this seeder and it worked well for us.  We planted corn, squash, beans seeds,etc with no problem.  Our dirt was really loose with no clumps and worked great. Clumps would be a problem, since your row may not be straight by pushing the clumps out of the way.  Our garden has about 40 rows and 50 feet long.  We have more than needed, so the neighborhood will benefit .  For us this product wooked very well and the garden is doing just fine."
4.0,"The use of this planter, makes it easy to space and get proper coverage. Have not used it enough to determine durability, but i think it will hold up very good."
5.0,The best purchase for the garden! Super easy and super fast. Never knew how quick I could plant straight rows of peas and corn
5.0,"Well built, It is not all plastic like most seeders I have seen. Easy to put together, and to use."
5.0,I have a friend that owns this model. It makes it so much easier to plant. Little assembly and arrived perfectly.
5.0,Arrived on time and performed great! I have a 3000 sq ft garden and it really did a great job. My other planter after 24 years had to be replaced and I was afraid that nothing would ever match up. This planter was a great replacement and investment.
5.0,This little guy works!!! I used it to plant rows of corn for my deer plots. Worked like a charm
4.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing and had concerns about the constuction. But for a small garden I think it should last a long time as long as you use it correctly and are not rough with it. I have back trouble and had just about given up on gardening  and this made it easier to plant. But I do have red clay and you must use it as soon as you finish tilling or the clay will be to hard for it to work. Through the years I have composited and that helps the soil but still have not built a good layer of soft soil. I think it is priced a little high for what t is, But I would recomend it."
5.0,thank u thank u got best price on earthway seder  im in love with it im farmer plants lots of different seeds cant waii to use this year plates came with it  it hard to beat this earthway nothing wrong very pleased thank you AMAZON
5.0,This makes seeding so much easier. Spaces the seed just where they need to be. My garden in 300 feet by 80 ft so this made my life so much easier.
5.0,"These are the first reading glasses I have ever purchased. I am super pleased they are no bulky and very light on my face.  It's great that 3 are included as  I keep a pair at work, home and in the car. The quality is also nice after a month they are holding up. The only thing that sucks is getting old and having to order these :)"
5.0,The durable solid brass construction speaks for itself. Forget silly plastic nozzles with no pressure and parts that can break. More than worth the price.
5.0,"Well made!  Just like the nozzle's Dad had when I was a kid.  Took a few minutes to figure out how to get distance, but wow, I could stand on my porch and water most of the yard!  Great for washing the car too, will get the grime out of the tightest crevice."
5.0,Excellent quality
4.0,"I like it for the most part.  The only down-side is you have to turn the nozzle through every adjustment to shut it off.  In other words, there is no immediate way to turn it off until you go through numerous streams depending on where you were."
5.0,Was so upset the BF lost my original hose nozzle I had for more than twenty years.  I fretted that I would not be able to replace with comparable quality in this day and age of cheapening up everything to make a buck.  This was excellent.  Much better than anything in the stores and a very decent replacement for my beloved hose nozzle.
5.0,Works great. High quality. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,This is the only nozzle that lasts longer than a year. It doesn't have any flimsy plastic on it. Love it!
5.0,Works great; good buy!
3.0,Regular
5.0,cuts great.
5.0,These are very good cutters
5.0,Great quality for the price
5.0,"I read that some of these have rusted. Haven't had for more than a couple months, but I keep them in the shed and clean them after use."
4.0,We are clipping away with our Gilmour Hedge Clipper.
3.0,it's ok
3.0,"They do the job for the smallest branches and leaves. However, they require a TON of force for even the smaller branches on your basic shrubbery. I would not recommend for anything more heavy duty than light gardening."
4.0,"OK, Here's my take. The clippers are made well. They seem sturdy and are of decent craftsmanship. Made in China like everything else these days. They cut really well. They rust super fast. I used them to tidy up a couple hedges in only a few ares. I would say I used them less than 10 minutes total time. The day was dry, the hedges were dry. The clippers rusted within 15 minutes. The rust only appeared where the blades made contact with the foliage. I of course sprayed them down with a good protectant/ lubricant before storing. I expect to get good usage from them, but I don't recall ever seeing a garden tool rust so quickly. If you can get them for a cheap price, I say do it. You could find better if cost is no object to you."
5.0,"This hedge trimmer works great for shaping my ficus hedges and lemon trees. There is a limit to how thick the branches can be, however so plan on using a different tool for anything heavy duty. Would buy again."
2.0,rusted after a few weeks. Cheap disappointing product.
5.0,This is my second season with this planter and I still love it. Our garden is about 1/2 acre and I dreaded the thought of spring planting. The last few years before this planter I didn't use the whole space. Three years ago I bought a plastic version and I couldn't get it to work right at all so I returned it. I really took a leap when I ordered this. I'm so glad I did. It is easy to use and handles small seeds and large seeds. Wouldn't put in a garden without it!
5.0,"Lives up to our expectations; saves our backs, and is so efficient. Takes some practice changing plates, and learning which ones work for individual types of seeds. Makes planting so much easier!"
5.0,looking forward to using  I am hoping that it does what it says and makes seed time not so awful  looks sturdy enough for the job
5.0,"I bought the Earthway 1001-B after reading as many reviews as I could find and watching every YouTube video there is.  This appeared to be the best option for the price and size of my garden (1/4 acre.)
  My seeder arrived sooner than the expected delivery date, Wooo'hooo, assembly was super easy and fast.  The unit is made of structual grade aluminum and dense plastic.  Sturdy enough, but I don't recommend leaving it in the sun (breaks down plastic)
The supplied seed plates are adequate for the average gardener, but I went ahead and ordered the six additional plates. This was a good idea as I can now plant almost every seed known to man.
  I recommend practicing with the seeder on the ground you are planting before actually using seed.  I found that the ground needs to be clean (no roots, debris, straw, etc) so it doesnt build up against the guide foot causing a huge furrow.
  The ground needs to be worked very fine and and level, no big clumps, big rocks or pot holes.  This way the front wheel (which actually powers the seed plate) can operate without binding and deliver seed at a measured rate.
  I am six foot tall and found that the seeder handles were a little short for me, I didn't like having to bend over to push the unit.  I found handle extensions on the Earthway site but could not justify $40.00 with shipping.  I had some aircraft grade aluminum flat stock from a boat project, so 30 minutes later I made 12 inch extensions.  Raising the handles 6 inches was just right and actually changed the angle of the handle enough to make pushing the unit very comfortable.
  The bottom line is that I planted Sweet Corn, Cowpeas, Bush beans, Pole beans, Lima beans, and Okra, 1/4 acre, with changing seed and plates, in 1 hour.  This may not sound fast, but it took me longer to plant just the Lima beans by hand.
  I went ahead and ordered the optional fertilizer attachment from Earthway.  When it arrived, at first glance I was skeptical, but after using it I was very pleased.  This device is a gravity feed system, so you must walk at an even pace to insure even coverage, and the fertilizer must be dry (no dampness) to insure even flow.
  I now have everything sprouting and growing like mad.  I went ahead and also got the Earthway ""Kentucky"" Wheel hoe with wooden handles.  This unit comes with a furrow plow (reversible two size), a moldboard plow, (great for raised rows), and a five tine cultivator foot.  I also got the optional oscillating hoe, this has proven invaluable.  I have used every attachment, especially the oscillating hoe to remove some very annoying and obnoxious weeds from my 1 and 1/2 acre yard.  The oscillating hoe cuts weeds just below the surface and does not leave gouges in the yard.
  I would highly recommend these products to anyone, especially if they have a large garden area. I am very pleased with the products and Amazon service is excellent."
3.0,Not what i wanted and returned it with no hassles at all
5.0,"This is a great product and has worked very well.  We have a large garden (greater than 5000 sq feet), and this helps lay out rows of seed very quickly and evenly spaced.  No more thinning needed of small seed.  No more having to bend down to lay out rows of seed.  50 foot rows done in minutes."
5.0,"I ordered this a little early but liked the pricing.  It arrived sooner that expected and was packaged well.  I haven't been able to use it as of yet, still getting snow here, but am looking forward to using it."
5.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this product.

** Assembly Required **
Some assembly is required, so you'll need to set aside about 1/2hr for this (I got a friend to do this for me in 15 mins).

** Land Preparation **
Land MUST be properly prepared before use. Our 2500 sq ft plot was properly tilled so that the soil crumbled easily in our hands

** Ease of Use **
The seed plates worked well and for more than 90% of the time, dropped 1 seed per hole at the correct spacing.
It is very light-weight, yet sturdy.
Comfortable to walk behind over long distances
Easy to set depth of trough for planting (up to 2"")
Easy to clean
Comes with a kick stand to park anywhere

** Complaints **
Chain, which is used to cover the seed, should be a little heavier
Handle should be adjustable - longer for taller persons and shorter otherwise
container for seeds could be larger to avoid many refills

** Other **
Comes with 6 interchangeable plates, including one for carrots. I have only tried the plates for corn and string beans
I've seen elsewhere where, using tape, you can block out holes in the seed plates to space the seeds further"
5.0,"This is the second Earthway seeder that I have owned and it IS my experience that it is one of the best on the market.

I will concede that the seeder is very light and made of aluminum and plastic, but do you really want a portable seeder that is heavy and cumbersome to balance?  If that is what you want, then buy a pull behind planter and use a tractor to pull it.

This seeder is very well balanced and believe it or not--well made.  I use it mostly for sweet corn and bush beans.  I've tried it for spinach, cucumber, and squash and really didn't like the results, but since they are hilled beds and easy to plant by hand it really wasn't a deal breaker.  Really, I bought this primarily for planting green beans and sweet corn, because I'd rather take a bullet to the head than bend over to plant long rows of said seeds.

One other thing:  Make sure that your garden is well-tilled before using the seeder.  It will not plant through hard pan.  Happy planting!

Update 5-16-13:  This year I decided to plant peas.  They sowed as easily as corn and beans.  But, my garden was very well-tilled with a Troybuilt Horse before planting.  The finer your soil is the better this seeder works.  The drag chain will actually work to cover your seeds if the garden is very finely tilled."
5.0,Cut my planting time by 2/3rds... I could never get plant spacing this even dropping seeds by hand! Saves time and seed by not having to thin my rows later.
4.0,"Not as good as the hose they sold 7 or 8 years ago, but it does stay flexible more than other hoses I've owned, except the Gilmour hose I purchased about 7 or 8 years ago, which is still holding up as strong and flexible as ever!"
3.0,it's a hose.
5.0,"This is my second purchase of the best hose I've had.  It is very durable, based on the condition of the 1st one, which has remained very flexible, has not twisted, and is fairly light weight -  quality item that I definitely recommend"
5.0,Best hose I've ever owned. doesn't kink up. Paired mine with a Suncast Aquawinder automatic hose reel.
5.0,So far no kinks ...
3.0,"I purchased this hose on the basis of previous Gilmour Flexogen 8-ply hoses that I've owned.  The older hoses easily get 5 stars; my parents have some from the 80s or 90s that are still in excellent shape and are pretty much impossible to kink unless you're actively trying.  I bought myself one around 2005 that seems to be of the same quality as my parents', and I use it quite frequently.  All of these older hoses had labels that prominently said ""the only 8-ply.""  The label on the newer hose doesn't mention 8-ply anywhere, even though the product title does.  The newer hose was obviously of a lower quality as well; there are plenty of other hoses out there that kink more easily, but this one was still pretty easy to kink, unlike the older ones I've used.
I returned it and ordered a commercial-style plain heavy rubber hose (not available on Amazon, as far as I can tell) that had reviews complaining only of the weight of the hose while praising its durability and kink-resistance.
A final note is that the parent company information on the back of the label has changed since 2005, though I don't remember the new info since I returned the hose."
5.0,Best hose out there.  Good price also
1.0,NAY
5.0,"LOVE IT!!!  No more crimping hoses to frustrate me!!  Hubby thought old one worked just fine~~then you water the front!  Cut my watering time literally in half, the rest of the time being spent on uncrimping the old hose every two minutes--UGH!!  So now I just need to somehow have another Flexogen hose magically appear for the back yard! The reinforcement at the spigot end makes a difference.  Fifty foot hose not heavy or hard to roll back up. (NOTE: I am 65, have had major back surgery and have scoliosis; so bending over is very hard on me.)  Best hose we've ever had!!"
5.0,Excellent- heavy duty and the perfect size for my townhome patio.
5.0,Great hose nozzle. It's great quality and holds up compared to the cheap plastic ones.
4.0,Good
4.0,my pool guy swears by this nozzle so I followed his advice and love it.  Its just like the one I had as a kid.  Some things ARE made like they used to be!!
5.0,excellent
5.0,Simple from sprinkle to stream. Been using it for years without a leak. To stop water flow twist nozzle.
5.0,Works well
4.0,Thanks
1.0,Not as advertised
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Works great. Recommend highly.
5.0,Very sharp even after daily use. Easy grip and great value.
5.0,"This was a life saver.  I did not know that there were special shears you're supposed to use for the garden, and often struggled to cut some roses by hacking at the stems with...ordinary scissors.  Now, these shears glide through the stems like butter."
5.0,Does the job
3.0,"bad goods.
OOps!!  the defect.  low quality."
3.0,Cut well. Locking mechanism difficult to use.
3.0,These became dull after just a few weeks. That's quite disappointing.
3.0,Just okay
5.0,Strong!
5.0,"Works great! Just ordered my 2nd pair, only because I lost the 1st pair. I had them for about 3+ yrs. They have survived everything I could max them out to. Yes they should be cleaned after certain trimmings, like Xmas trees and other sappy bushes. I have a sharper and used it once after a couple of yrs. But for $10? I could not really expect them to last a true lifetime! I kid u not when I say I had no mercy on them! If it was any thicker than what I could stretch these to cut I needed a chainsaw Lol!  Just put a lil muscle and funk behind it and it will cut it!!"
4.0,"for the price, these are great... don't expect them to last too long and i will no try to cut big branches like a would do with better quality ones."
1.0,Not sure how anyone could give this more than a one star. The blades rusted after one use. Obviously cheap China construction.
3.0,"These were a great price and got here fast! However, after a few uses they seemed to get dull fast. I'm not having a hard time cutting through branches that are less than an inch thick :("
3.0,Rusted in the first year I owned them just from the moisture of the plants. I did not leave them in the rain or outside. I'm on my 3rd year and they're not very sharp anymore. If you have a good amount to trim yearly get something better.
5.0,"Got these for my elderly mom who loves to garden.  She loves them. Says the handles are comfortable and it's lightweight.  I recommend.  Good price and good deal with ""Prime"", thanks Amazon!"
5.0,"My parents had the same hedge cutters for years.....made in America......I have been through,  I don't know how many makes and models of hedge trimmers during just the past fifteen years.  THIS cutter puts them all to shame!  I cannot only see the blades cutting, but also HEAR steel against steel.  Very comfortable to use.....just the right handle length.  Forget about those extendable-handle units...all for show.  This trimmer delivers.  Would highly recommend."
5.0,"These small hedge clippers worked well for trimming the shrubs in my yard. They are comfortable in my hands, and lightweight enough that they did not make my arms and back ache when using them.

I do have one complaint, though: they come with a heavy plastic piece that is used to fasten onto the clippers the cardboard product label (see photo). I had to use a saw to get it off. Scissors did not work because it was really thick, heavy plastic. It was a real hassle."
2.0,Have trouble cutting even small branches down the blade toward the tips.  My biggest complaint is that it's hard to lock the handles in place so they don't slide up and down. These clippers will cut larger branches if you cut down toward the larger end of the blades. At the pivots.
4.0,great value
5.0,very nice for the price
4.0,"You can tell they're not the highest quality, but they're still very good for the price. I used them to trim a ton of vine in the garden, some large, some small. So far, they seem to be holding up OK!"
5.0,great
5.0,"Exactly what I paid for, works well."
5.0,Super Quality.
5.0,Thanks
5.0,An old design that woks well and never breaks
5.0,Simple and effective.  Much nicer than modern cheap pistol grips.  High quality solid brass.
3.0,"It's a love hate relationship in this house. I hate this style of nozzle. BUT, another member LOVES it.
So,
If you like this style of nozzle I take it on good authority this is a good one.
If you don't like this style then why are you looking here?  ;)"
4.0,works fine.
5.0,Best nozzle ever!!  Don't hesitate.
5.0,"Sturdy old fashioned brass nozzle....nothing on it to break or stick. Nozzle does have a rubber coating that is not pictured, but helps for gripping."
1.0,"Simply put, it doesn't cut.  I should have returned it."
4.0,"Not bad for the price. They work great on shrubs and very thing branches, but anything over maybe 1/4 an inch and these things will struggle."
5.0,great purchase
5.0,good shears!
3.0,"OK quality.  OK basic function as shrubbery hedge cutter.  Disappointing but it's not a surprise, that it is made in China.  The plastic grips seem comfortable with or without gloves.

There is a 1/4"" hole drilled near (less than 2"") the tip of one the blades.
This was used for a plastic rivet for securing the blades within a stiff cardboard sleeve.  The hole could be used to secure the blades with a padlock, possibly for safety, but is most useful for hanging the tool on a hook or nail.

2.0,Ok
5.0,great product
3.0,I have a few small bushes that need trimming.  This will handle small bushes and grass.  Not trees or branches.
5.0,good
5.0,these were perfect for my shrubs and bushes as well as a few small trees in my yard.  I had no problems at all. Definitely a great purchase for small yard maintenance.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted
5.0,So great!
2.0,Arrived dirty and possibly used. I would like to return them for a refund.
2.0,Worked great for one season. After attempting to cut a thicker branch the shears bent out instead of cutting through the wood. they were nice band new. After some wear they stop cutting and began to tear through.
4.0,"They cut well, did the job, served the purpose.  Hope to use them many more times."
5.0,These are sharp and fit well in your hand. I enjoy using them.
5.0,Easy to use and sharp! I bought these to use when making bouquets and they are great!
5.0,great
5.0,"Wonderful quality, heavy duty pruning shears!"
5.0,A
3.0,"OK, but does kink."
3.0,hose is ok but I thought it was 100 ft only 50
5.0,Lived up to expectations . Am pleased with purchase.
4.0,"well made, sturdy; not as flexible as I'd hoped, but perfect for our front porch."
5.0,Works great.  Re-coils easily.  Seems very durable.
3.0,This is a nice heavy duty hose but unfortunately it began kinking the very first time I used it :(  So a bit disappointing.
5.0,Nice quality hose
5.0,"Great product, love the lifetime warranty."
5.0,Very kink resistant and not too heavy.
5.0,I like it. Does the job. I have one for the front and back yards.
5.0,Can't wait to use it this spring.  But like the last item won't be sure till I actually use the product.
5.0,"If your garden is big enough, and you plant any quantity of seeds, this thing is a real savior. It's not great for small quantities of seed, or for short (less than 4 feet) rows, but for a large garden, it saves my back, it saves time, it saves seed, and I wouldn't live without it. I've used one for years - just bought a second to clamp together with the first so I can plant two rows at once, which I do for several things anyway."
3.0,Everything arrived on time and in good shape. after I read directions and assembled I found it to be missing the carrot seed plate. Other than that everything was fine.
3.0,"For years the running gag of garden season in our family has been Rod's seeder.  It was a primitive aluminum wheel I found among my dad's tools, and it didn't work very well.  By July the evidence was plain to see:  clumps of vegetables at the ends of rows, tapering gradually to nothing by the middle, another clump, and so on over each of the 75' rows.  Of course the trend was worse for carrots, lettuce and even beets.  Only when a family member intervened and meticulously dropped individual seeds into the planting spaces did we end up with a smoothly-flowing garden.

I resolved to change all this through the purchase of an Earthway Precision Garden seeder.  Didn't happen.  I just ended up with a cooler toy with which to mess up spring seeding.  I haven't lost the extra plates yet;  they store quite nicely in the hopper, but the cost of the implement has indicated that it receive pride of place on the bench in one of the garden sheds, and I'm getting sick of looking at it after three hours of use over three years.

The Earthway is visually interesting and appears well made, though the clip to hold the marker bar in place won't hold it.  In honesty I can't say that it has improved my planting performance in any of the three garden plots on the farm.

So if you're a bumbling gardener like this author, don't look to the Earthway Precision Garden Seeder for a magical solution to your lack of organization.  It does look cool on a shelf, though."
5.0,"I plant about 1/2 acre each year and this little baby cut planting time by about 3/4. It isn't perfect, you have to watch that the seeds are dropping correctly, but I am soooo glad I bought it. If it missed a couple of spots, it was no big deal to pop a few seeds in. I recommend this whole heartedly!!!"
4.0,"Got the job done.  I planted 6, 25 ft. rows of corn and had a good stand.  1 problem, depth of seed planted was sporatic. some were too near the top of ground and some were almost too deep. The ground was very soft.  But planter had to have a steady control of planter it kept wanting to ride out of the ground.  Once you experienced that and adjusted it worked well."
4.0,"This is a good quality machine, but it does take some time to get used to using it.  My garden soils are quite heavy, clayish, and it does not work very well in that type of soil.  The sandy or loam soils work much better.  It is just going to take some time to get the hang of it.  It does a nice job, fast, accurate in the lighter soils."
2.0,"I need to call tech support to see if this is just a bad unit.  Assembled quite easily, large seeds seems to work well but the smaller the seed, the more it tends to (profoundly) over seed and then simply mash the seeds and the wheel gets jammed and distorted with the crushed seed debrie.  I'll contract customer service and if remedied will raise my rating.  So now I have rows that will need a LOT of thinning and a bunch a crushed kale seed..."
5.0,"I had one of these planters 20 years ago,and just loved it .I am handycaped but muself and 3 other men planted a 200' by 200' garden that was already rototilled,in 2 1/2 hrs."
5.0,"I purchased the Earthway 1001-B in 2011.  I used it to plant my peas, corn, and okra in my 2012 garden.  It really made the planting easy.  It saved the back because it eliminated a lot of bending.  In addition, I had real straight rows with plenty of crops.  I will be using this thing as long as I am gardening.  I planted one garden that was 30 x 60 and another garden that was 50 x 90.  I planted lettuce, collards, and turnips with the planter this fall.  I have the best looking turnips and collards that I have ever planted in real good straight rows.  I also use the planter to fertilize (side dress) the corn in my garden.  This planter is simple to use and makes a valuable resource for me."
3.0,not as pictured. Instead was coated in black rubber and might be better. Works ok. just wish it was the one pictured.
5.0,"Better than the one in my backyard. Twist like silk, love it! Comes in a black rubber jacket which is great so when I throw it down its protected"
5.0,love this nozzle...it sprays just perfectly and works well with my low water pressure...hopefully it will last a long time...
4.0,Has a nice powerful spray or you can turn it down to a mist. I do get tired of turning it instead of squeezing a traditional sprayer. Also when you mist the center is void of water it is more of a circle of mist.
5.0,"They have not failed us a single time and being disabled, I toss them down onto concrete daily as I am unable to bend to place them back onto the ground gently.  Never any leak, never any problem. Just ordered our third so now EVERY hose we have, has its own nozzle and no more hassle to switch when I change hoses. LOVE these. I can gently spray a fine mist onto my wife's delicate plants, or knock a squirrel off the top of our fence when it is eyeballing the wife's garden:-)

  I can honestly use this for ANY application and again, have had zero problems....."
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, a sturdy easy to use nozzle that should last for years. But same item may be cheaper at Home Depot."
2.0,"I received a pure brass nozzle, no rubber.  Because I needed to use it right away, I kept it.  The brass nozzle works ok, but I wanted the rubber grip.  I suppose this is more of a review on the seller and shipper than of the product."
2.0,The black rubber grip did not come with this Gilmour 528 Solid Brass Twist Nozzle. I expected it to arrive as is shown in the picture.
4.0,Easy to shut off with rubber and rubber cushions it when dropped.  I like this unit as it has a nice powerful stream.
3.0,"Keep in mind, when you open this nozzle up there is no way to control the flow... you twist to control the spray pattern, but there is no flow control. No matter what it is always on full blast, either wide fan spray or narrow stream, its always full blast... unless of course you only open your spigot partially, but thats a pain to run back and forth to adjust the flow from the spigot.  I guess I should have know this already based on its design.

However, if you don't have delicate plants to water this nozzle is very well made, high quality. Its made of only two pieces of solid brass, and you can quickly twist through the range of flows. The patterns are very precise and the solid stream is pencil thin...with good pressure you could easily hit your neigbors upstairs windows, across the street! if you wanted to...

Its a good nozzle, just realize you have no flow control. I guess it didn't dawn on me until I used it."
4.0,Good quality. Good price. Does a nice job. :)
5.0,Super...cuts like butter...highly recomment
5.0,"I did note in the reviews the problems with it rusting, mine did as well after just one use.  I used a wire brush to brush it off then put a protective coat of oil on it.  While that is a major drawback, I can't complain about anything else.  The price was good, and the craftsmanship is very good.  They're sturdy and work fantastically well on the honeysuckle hedge I'm taking down.  I just wish the metal was of higher quality."
5.0,Good product for the price.
5.0,"Cut my bushes for the first time, and was completely satisfied."
5.0,Nice sharp blades that does the job
5.0,"Worked well, no issues."
4.0,Work well.
4.0,good shears
4.0,"these locked up, but started working again after applying some graphite"
4.0,Simple design and good quality.  I did have to add an additional washer to prevent water leaking from the base but maybe it was my hose connection that was the problem.
5.0,All metal is what you want. You don't have to worry about plastic parts breaking. There is also less moving parts on this so less things to go wrong.
5.0,"After going through several plastic nozzles, I decided to buy one of the older style brass ones. This one has performed well since I purchased it 10 months ago in Feb 2012. I like the rubber coating on the exterior for grip and paint protection. It gives a fairly even spray at all settings and is easy to adjust on the fly."
5.0,"Excellent product, strong enough for daily use.  I have dogs so you can imagine what this sprayer is used for when keeping our backyard clean."
2.0,"This product is not being written about for it's quality, but for my being deceived into buying it thinking it was made in USA. When you go into the made in America sites, these products are listed. This is fraud."
1.0,"Ooh!  A Brass Nozzle - got to outlast plastic by a lifetime.  Wrong!! This nozzle lasted awhile, but it broke apart at the base where it was machine pressed on.  Major design flaw.  Almost looks deliberate.  I would not buy this brand again."
1.0,"As others have noted, it leaks (actually sprays!) where the pieces are press fit together.  Really wanted to like this as the rubber coating keeps it from damaging the hose pot we keep it in.  Just ordered the Dramm nozzle for about the same price."
5.0,This is the second nozzel of this type I've purchased. The best water nozzel I have ever used. You will be impressed by it's performance. My first one is 4 years old and performs just as good as the new one.
1.0,"I thought this nozzle would be the last one I would have to buy for a long time, but it broke after only a few uses. The top snapped right off the connector ring; I was very surprised. Very disappointing!"
1.0,"This leaked the first time I put it on.  The one I got today was from Lowe's.  I got it so that I could have a nozzle that doesn't spray me in the face while I try to water the plants in my garden.  It didn't spray me in the face.  Just all the way up my arm and down my front.  First time I used it.  No amount of adjusting helped.  I'm taking it back.  I don't care about the product replacement guarantee.  Terrible!  This does not live up to Gilmore's reputation.  I agree with other reviewers who say that the product quality at Gilmore has cheapened since outsourcing to China.  I'm so frustrated that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find anything made with any degree of quality any more.  I just want an old fashioned, no frills, reliable hose nozzle.  Like the kind grandma used to use.  Is that really so hard?"
3.0,"The hose ends are well made and the hose coils easily on the ground, but it is prone to kinking."
5.0,I bought a similar craftsman hose a few years back that works fine but is very stiff. This one seems to be as well made but is much easier to drag around flexibility-wise.
5.0,nice and flexible
5.0,Love this hose! Very heavy duty and does not crimp up. I can tell it will last a long time. Money well spent.
2.0,Does not last.
4.0,So far so good.  Time will tell.
5.0,"Excellent hose, very flexible, very minimal kinking.  Excellent value."
1.0,"Looks great but after a few weeks of intermittent use, water is leaking from in between the brass parts that attach to the faucet. Would not buy again!"
4.0,It is a described.
5.0,"Works well, does not kink partly because of heavy wall, so you don't really want a long one of these, would weigh a ton."
5.0,"i thought the rubber around the solid brass would be better than not having it, but i now prefer just solid brass for better grip."
5.0,You just can't beat these classic nozzles.  There is nothing to break or wear out.  I have purchased so many plastic type nozzles that have multiple settings and don't last one year.  Buy one of these and end your problems.
2.0,Sorry I bought this.  Can't really adjust to my liking.  Should have returned this.
1.0,"I really rate this product a Zero. Here's why:

It Broke as a result of a poor mfg. technique. Well, 'It Leaks' (...is technically more accurate but what's the difference?)...where the shaft of the inner core mates with the larger ruberized part that screws onto the hose. They are two separate parts apparently press-fit together! And when presurized it leaks alot...not just drip, 2 seconds, drip..it has become a small trickle. Worse, the core (and ruberized adjusting jacket) now spin at the faulty juncture effectively preventing the adjustability of the spray. To try and make this clearer, I can no longer grasp the long ruberized jacket and twist to adjust the spray, because it spins at the faulty juncture. So yeah, It Broke. Haven't even had it 4 months.

PLEASE do Not buy this product. I am still looking for the perfect..Inexpensive, nozzle. When I find it, I'll post it her, (see UPDATE below). I actually have found 'a' perfect nozzle at Griots Garage but it isn't inexpensive.

[** UPDATE May have found a better nozzle, and it costs $10 just like this Gilmour. Look up the Dramm brass hose nozzle: Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dramm-12380-Heavy-Duty-Brass-Adjustable-Hose-Nozzle/dp/B001DGII5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle</a>. This heavy brass nozzle has no press fittings to fail. Instead of two pieces press fit together as described above, Dramm has machined the inner core and the part that screws onto the hose out of one solid piece of brass. It'll still crack if you leave it outside and presurized during a freeze, but at least it won't break as a result of a poor manufacturing technique.**]"
1.0,"This product contains lead. There is a big warning on the back warning the user about lead, and asking the user to wash his hands after using this product. Don't buy this unless you're comfortable with having ALL your yard water flowing through this lead containing nozzle. I returned it unused."
5.0,"I was looking for a better spray nozzle than the trigger type plastic one we had. It was getting old, leaky, etc. After reading the reviews on this nozzle I thought to myself, ""how great can a nozzle be? Oh, what the heck..."" and went ahead and ordered it. This is a solid, easy to control nozzle that gets any type of spray you could need, without any leaking or faultering. It's a durable, quality item. I just love it!!! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! Thanks for a great product at a super price!!!"
5.0,"I bought this nozzle because I'm tired of cheap plastic ones, which break after a year.
So far, it is performing without problem (1 month).  I'm happy with my purchase."
1.0,"When I turned the hose on, the top of the nozzle flew off.  The parts cannot be put back together.  This product was useless."
5.0,I actually ended up buying another one of these at Lowes.  Should've checked there first to avoid the shipping cost through the Amazon.com third party seller.  Oh well.  I've used the nozzle to wash my cars and to water my grass and plants.  The twisting option gives you a variety of stream patterns/strengths for anything that I would need it for.  Another solid Gilmour product.
5.0,Love this nozzle. It's very high quality and delivers the amount of water you need with a simple twist. We're gradually tossing all our poor quality nozzles and hose connectors with quality items that we aren't cursing every time we turn the water on.
4.0,"They work really well but after a year of cutting, they have dulled somewhat but still continue to preform well."
5.0,was pleased
5.0,These are great for simple light trim work. If you want to do anything sizable or you just want to do a lot of trimming you'll need something heavier of course.
4.0,"We've used these to trim hedges this fall; will update the review next year if they're wearing badly, but so far, so good. We got what we paid for, and are happy with them."
4.0,"I have bad wrists and a huge juniper hedge.  I wanted a straight blade (husband hated sharpening wavy blades on the old shears), and I chose these because they were one of the lightest options.  I made it much farther with these before my wrists started hurting than I'd been able to do with my older pair, with faster recovery, so I'd say that's a win.
I've used these only for trimming/shaping, as I really think that for anything thick one ought to be using a hand pruner or loppers, anyway (and take that cut farther back into the bush).
I am giving four stars, rather than five, because at one point in their first day of use, they became very stiff, almost bound up.  I scrape my shears as I go, so I know it wasn't juniper gunk in the hinge.  My husband worked grease into the hinge, and they've been fine since, but I don't think that needing grease on the first use is ideal."
3.0,"They work, but not as well as I'd hoped based on other reviews.  They take out the thin branches with ease, but anything thicker than about 1/2"" diameter is a struggle.  The shears are not very sturdy, based on the fact that I was able to bend them while trying to get through a 1/2"" thick stem.  I think they'll continue to work for trimming off the newest growth on my shrubs, but I'm looking for something else to handle trimming back older, woodier overgrowth."
5.0,Haven't used it so much but overall experience is good
5.0,Works well
4.0,Simple product but does the job. Good price.
5.0,all excellent
5.0,I would highly recommend buying this for large plot planting....it has the side row marker which  makes it very nice.
4.0,"I bought this product to help me with my plantings of vegetable crops. The product works pretty good. I purchased the optional plates for the other crops. The one problem that I had with this is that the chain that is supposed to cover the seeds does not always work. It has a difficult time moving heavier soils. The resolution was a couple of nuts and bold through the chain to add weight.

I would recommend this product if your are planting multiple rows."
3.0,"I heard grave reviews about this seeder and purchased one, but have to admit it's not as easy as I was led to believe. I wish it would plant just a little bit deeper and do a better job at burying the seeds. Some seeds remained visible and washed away, especially if it rained after planting.

I like to take advantage of rain and many times plant on days it's going to rain, or the day before; so having some of my seeds wash away was not what I wanted. I know I can go over it with a rake, which I sometimes do, but I bought this to save time. If I have to go back over the rows I planted, that's not saving my time and defeats the purpose of why I got this in the first place.

I don't want to seem like I'm bashing the product because it really is a good product for what it does and is one of the better ones out there. But as a serious farmer, I was disappointed. Yet I would encourage any small garderner to go ahead and buy this."
5.0,Works just fine as long as your soil is worked properly.  Soil must not have clumps.  It does what it was designed to do.  You must watch soil depth for seed burial.  Sometimes the seeder moves along so quickly that you can ignore burial depth.  Product was worth the investment for the average gardener.
5.0,"Works really well, better than I expected. Planted 1000 corn seeds in about15 minutes, it manages different size seeds without any trouble."
5.0,This is a must have item for the serious gardener.  Plants the seeds quick and easy. Each seed at the correct depth. Super easy to use. Quick changes for differing seed sizes. Excellent.  Love mine.
3.0,"the planter works good in soil that is completely level. It is too light to work in dirt that isn't and will run all over the place.so keep that in mind when preparing your bed. If it was built a little heavier pehaps with sheet metal and rubber tires(instead of plastic) it would help with a rougher seed bed (clay based soil).I used it for planting small seeds mustard,lettuce,cabbage,broccoli,turnips. For the money Its ok. Wish they would make a heavier unit for a pull behind model."
4.0,the product is simple to use the plates have the type of seed to use them for written on the plate itself great planter
2.0,"i was so excited to buy the machine. i even paid more to get it delivers sooner. when i get home, trying to test the butternut seed, the seed was not fitting with any on the disc. it spoilt all my excitement.
can someone tell me which seeder am suppose to try to win. i don't feel like buying more discs until someone tell me if there is disc for this.
is it possible that the discs are US sizes. i tried fitting all but i failed.

later"
5.0,"My first time using the Earthway 1001-B was a great time saver I planted 3 rows of bush beans and 3 rows of corn about 150 ft in each row. I had the ground ready and would say I did all of this in about an hour, even changing disk. Used once and very satisfied!"
5.0,Nice grips and fun to use.
2.0,"Very sharp blade.  However, as with all my fiskars pruning shears, the lock/unlock button slides closed with each snip.  After many fiskars pruning shear purchases this will be the last."
5.0,Excellent
2.0,"I have used Fiskars All Steel Bypass Pruning Shears for years.  I think I had the last pair for twenty years, They were getting a bit grubby even with good care so I ordered a new pair.  The locking switch in the current design does not stay engaged and with the slightest bump, the shears open.  Disappointing and dangerous.  The previous shears had a notch with a ""finger"" which could be rotated into it so there was impossible to bump it, causing it to open."
5.0,exceeds my expectations
1.0,"Bought this $10.00 piece of CRAP November 9, 2017, Never used until spring of 2018!! it broke pruning a small rose tree green shoots on the very fourth cut. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! GARBAGE!!!"
1.0,"Useless! not sharp enough to cut branches, totally overpriced!!!"
5.0,"Very sharp, easy to prune the bushes.  Slightly less expensive than buying them in the big box store."
1.0,"Purchased in the winter. In spring when I got them out I discovered there is no spring on them. They are very sharp and cut well. Exactly what I depend on Fiskers for. However, these do not have a spring and I can cut a branch with one hand but must use both hands to open them only to cut another branch and again open with both hands. Exceedingly burdensome. Disappointed.  I did not think to check to see if they would automatically open.  Every pair I have had have opened automatically. The disadvantage of buying on line. Had I picked them up in a store I would have known the problem and not purchased"
3.0,"Pros:
Cut quite well.

Cons:
 The lock closed lever is stuff to use and doesn't work most of the time.
Construction seems flimsy compared to high quality shears."
4.0,Does the job I bought it to do. Well made. No problems.
5.0,Very nice balance make this easy to use.
4.0,"Doesn't cut through as thick of vegetation as I would like, but overall, is a very solid pair of hedge clippers that does the job."
5.0,Great for touch up hedge trimming!  Very sharp and can cut through some thick hedges.
5.0,Works Great!! Quick Delivery!!
5.0,Love these guys!!! They are super sharp and do not stick at all. I left these outside for a few rainy nights and they didn't rust or lose their sharpness. Easy to use even with my smaller hands. Highly recommend.
4.0,These were a good deal and efficient. But they rusted super fast. Probably cause we left them out in the yard but still.
4.0,"I bought these so I don't have to lug out the electric hedge trimmers all the time.  They work great.  I have had them for a few months and they have rusted over already.  I'll have to clean them up.  There is a plastic piece on them that keeps them in the package, I was never able to get that off or cut it off so it's still on the trimmers.  They cut well and do they job.  Great handles and they hold up well."
1.0,"This product is labeled, in a very proud manner, that it's made in the USA however the label clearly states that it is made in CHINA. I've returned it."
5.0,Not too heavy but sharp and easy to work with.
5.0,Nice heavy duty hose.
5.0,"Was so tired of past hoses always kinking, HOW EXASPERATING!!"
3.0,A lot heavier than I expected.  I did not return the hose because it works well where I using it.  I'm glad that I do not have to lug it around.  I do not doubt it's strength and durability....it's more like I have problems carrying it.
1.0,"After running this  75' hose in and out behind the deck to the backyard, both ends are leaking at the coupling.  I am totally aggravated and disappointed.  I would not recommend this product!"
3.0,Hose was not green as described.
5.0,Good hose- Good price
5.0,good price
1.0,"Amazing! It was like I ordered a gag hose on accident. Sprung a leak after 4 hours of use. Taped it up so I could continue using the hose. Sprung another leak when I turned the water back on. Taped it up again and turned the water back on. This time it began to swell up like a snake that  had just swallowed a rat. Then it swelled in a couple other places before bursting.  If you are looking to prank your neighbor, buy this hose and switch it out in the middle of the night. Guaranteed to delight, results within 4 hours of use."
5.0,"Time will tell, of course, but so far I'm very favorably impressed with both the hose and the fittings."
4.0,"Excellent hose overall.  The 100 ft. length kept me from having to buy short ones and couple them together.
Pros: Good price, great quality.  Brass fittings are substantially machined and not just cheap formed brass sheet.
Cons:  Very few.  It tends to flatten out when wound on a garden hose reel. No stripe to tell when it is twisting.
Recommendation: Flexibility and resistance to crushing on a hose reel tend to be contrary qualities.  I down-rated it one star for the flattening issue when used on a hose reel.  I recommend that during the summer season, leaving the pressure on the hose while winding on the reel, and then turning water off and releasing the pressure.  it will keep it loose and prevent crushing."
3.0,worksgreat
5.0,No problems with the Hedge clippers.
4.0,it works and is light weight and sharp
5.0,cuts stuff good
5.0,"excellent gets a little rust from moisture, but real sharp and easy handling"
2.0,Got dull after using only a couple of times.  Disappointed.
5.0,Solid and sturdy.  Great value.
5.0,Excellent...
5.0,Excellent for the price!
3.0,"Love these hedge cutters!
Although I have to say about 6 months in they started to dull and don't cut so well anymore."
5.0,Very good trimmers
5.0,Very sharp-work very well.
5.0,"Nice so far, i have used it once to trim the bushes and was also able to trim some small branches on a tree.  Feels sturdy and is very sharp.  No issues so far, would buy again."
3.0,Do the job but rusted almost immediately
5.0,Just the right size and shape for me and my two small hedges.
4.0,It is awesome product!!
5.0,"Sharp, strong, effective."
4.0,Sharp and the is a hole in the top blade for packaging label which could be used somehow.
5.0,"basic hedge clippers says it all. cuts up to 1/4 inch, but that's pushing it, better to use small pruner at that point. nice and sharp, easy to use"
5.0,$13 and a lifetime warranty for this strong and sharp product.  Very nice
5.0,"as expected, and arrived on time. quality product"
5.0,Exactly what I needed for my garden. Simple garden shears.
5.0,Works great.
5.0,Nice and sharp and easy to handle.
5.0,Very sharp and light at a great price.
2.0,They are not as sharp as I would like. I will have to sharpen them. Disappointed for the price!
5.0,"Comfortable, sharp shears.  I've used these for my rose bushes and fruit trees without breaking a sweat."
1.0,"Awful. Thew out my old shears after I used these for the first time to trim cut flowers. Three days later, I'm changing the water and trimming the ends and the shears are less sharp than the ones I threw out. I rinse the blades and wait for them to dry completely before I close them with the safety latch to store. Crap in my book"
3.0,"I've always liked Fiskars branded products. In the past they have worked well for me. I like the sharpness of this tool and the handles are comfortable. My only gripe is, when I am pruning with the tool upward, the sliding lock mechanism often slides down due to gravitational pull and locks the blades closed while in use. This gets very annoying. I've tried tightening the mechanism to no avail. I'll use them but with something jammed into the slot to keep them open. Shouldn't have to do that. Bad design in my opinion, but for the price, not bad."
5.0,Oh how I love these. anytime you can buy something Fiskars you know that you are getting a great product!!! You can never go wrong with Fiskars. They are easy to clean and use
5.0,"well designed and made product, have planted large area of beets in quick time straight rows and accurate depth. All have now germinated and could not be more happy with results."
4.0,i bought this to take to the philippines and i have assembled it.it is not very complicated but will require a few tools.it is of sturdy construction and i am impressed that the plastic parts are rather strong/tough.i am going to only fill the seed cup as to be able to view the seeds being picked-up and dropped through the opening/shoot.at first i will not use chain to cover seeds so i can check seed dispensing and spacing.i have only rated this w/4 stars as i have not used it yet but i like what i see thus far.i have read reviews of this planter and most are very favorable.the shipping was quick and the item was not as hard to assemble as i thought...and since it is made in the usa...i like that very much(5star)
5.0,Works as advertised. Very well built and should last for years and years. Very good price compared to cheaper built seeders that cost more.
5.0,It works realy well in well fit up soil that is fine and leveled i took extra care preparing the seed bed for my beans and radishes befor using it and it worked great i learnd when i planted my sweet corn that if it isn't really fit up fine and leveled out smooth it doen't cover well and the corn came up real spotty but after learning that it worked great for the beans and radishes it made planting a lot easyer well worth the money and would definatly recomend to a friend
5.0,I love the seeder. Makes planting so easy. Mark out the first row and go. No bending or stooping anymore. Garden is coming up real nice!
4.0,Heard a guy talking about a garden seeder and I decided to purchase one myself.  It does exactly what it's supposed to do so I am pleased with it.  Makes gardening a lot easier.
3.0,"This product speeds up planting and prevents the need to bend over so much to plant, but I found the seed plates to be ineffective. In most cases it dropped too many seeds too close together. And then when seed chamber gets low, it creates large gaps. The corn plate isn't effective for field corn as the scoops are too small, and for popcorn it's too large. The radish plate worked well as long as the seed chamber was quite full, but the chamber becomes ineffective when seeds become sparse because the chamber dosen't funnel the seeds to the plate very well (with any of the plates, but more evident with the smaller ones)."
5.0,"I've used one of these since the 1970's, when I borrowed it from my friend and neighbor.  I bought one of my own last year.  They haven't really changed the design much at all. It is a fantastic seeder for the money. You'll love it.

For those who worry over the light weight: You'll learn to appreciate how light and strong it really is.  You can pick the whole thing up and pour out the extra seeds back into the seed pack easily. If seeds get behind the plate, you might want to check and make sure you have the plate on right! I pour some baby talc in with my seeds, and I never have much trouble. If you need to get the last seed planted, just lean the planter over to the side some, and the seeds - every one - can get caught by the plate and planted.

If you have cover crop trash to plough through, here's what I do.  This will kill your warranty, and I don't recommend you do this unless you're handy with tools.... Open one chain link where it attaches to the frame, so it makes a hook.  Then, in trashy soil, you can just unhook the drag chain and let it go. Set the seeder a little deeper, and you're good to plant. With the drag chain in place like they've designed it, the drag chain will gather trash and make a problem if you don't have nicely tilled seed beds. Being able to unhook the drag chain and let it loose is the answer. I don't know why the company doesn't do this, but they didn't call me and ask for advise. It works for me, though.

A $500 seeder will save a little more seed. I'd rather have plants to thin out than bare spots to try to reseed and play catch-up.  You can't beat this little rig for the money."
4.0,"The unit is a good machine for the cost and it does a really nice job of planting the seeds. What I did not like, was it would not pick up a few of the seeds that was left in the bottom of the box. You would almost have to use two bags of seeds so the disk would pick them up and then take the rest out after planting."
4.0,"I just received this unit today. I was concerned about some of the reviews. I have to say though this unit performed beyond expectations. I planted 2000 row feet of beans in less than 20 minutes. Your soil does need to be fine and freshly tilled but it saved a tremendous amount of time. While some reviewers felt it was flimsy, the unit held up fine. I am in Zone 5 in the high desert of New Mexico."
5.0,Very nice sturdy and flexible hose.
4.0,"It's a great garden hose. No kinks, easy to handle and to roll up. Larger diameter (5/8"") means lower pressure drop, in other words great water flow. The dark grey color is nice. Great product."
5.0,Very nice hose !!!  Very flexible !!
1.0,Never got to use it.  Leaked all over from where the hose connects to the connector.
5.0,"Very Good ! unrolled it and let it sit for about 1/2 hr in 60 degree sun haven't had a kink yet . very heavy duty feel, rolls up nice, great connectors HD and no leaks."
5.0,"works great, and is long enought so we don't need extentions"
5.0,Solid hose with good/solid brass fittings.
3.0,Not kink resistant at all.  The fitting connecting to the spigot leaked like crazy until I cranked it down with a large pair of pliers.  This has never been necessary before.
4.0,Really heavy and hard for a female to handle. Otherwise good hose.
4.0,This does the job when I want to hose off the front porch of our townhouse.  It is hard to find a nice one like this in the store in this size.
1.0,incredibly blunt.  They don't cut through anything.  I'd have returned them had I kept the box.
1.0,"After using this once pieces of the metal broke off - yes that's right, broke off. Around where the hinge is. Rendered the clippers useless and ended up buying a more substantial one at Home Depot."
4.0,Works well
1.0,"Worse product ever from Amazon. I recommend Amazon to stop selling this product, it is compromising your name and the opinion of your customers. I used this product for only 30 min and is ready to recycle it. Worse product ever."
5.0,sharp and fast shipping
5.0,Received good quality clippers at great price!
5.0,Works great on small branches and hedges.
5.0,"I am relatively new to outdoor work, recently divorced and a 57 year old woman. I have always done the inside cleaning, NOT the outdoor work that always seemed so terrible. So, here I am, on my own, and I am definitely doing a lot of research before I buy an item. These hedgers are very sharp, so working with them is easy. Believe me I am not strong, so the length and sharpness of the blade is very important to me.

I am in Alabama and the heat has been very bad lately, but my work goes quickly because of the ease of the use of these hedge cutters. I had been using a pair I borrowed from a friend, they looked all shiny and new, but I could hardly cut through small branches, so I knew those were not for me.

I would definitely recommend these to everyone!"
4.0,It works
2.0,Rust already.....after 1 month?
5.0,Good quality
5.0,"Nice.  They seem to keep their sharpness, easy to fit in my hands.  The little button that holds it open or closed is sort of small, but I won't ding them for that."
5.0,"very sharp shears, and they remain sharp after I've been using them for months.  I don't cut really big branches with them and I use them once or twice a week."
3.0,"the second time I used it the slide stop to hold it closed will not work. :(
Twisting handle grip is annoying"
4.0,"The locking piece feels flimsy and cheap, I suppose you could get a quality bolt to swap out, but the important parts seem like good quality."
4.0,Solid but wish the handles were softer.
5.0,Fiskars brand is always a good quality.  This product arrived in secure packaging and I am very happy with the weight and size of the product.  Can't wait to try them out.
4.0,very sharp
5.0,works great!
2.0,The coating seems to come off fairly easily.
5.0,"My last pair of $25 hedge clippers lasted 5 months before snapping in the middle. If hedge clippers last 5 monthswhy not try a cheaper pair? Turns out, they're every bit as good as the Home Depot ones and theyve lasted longer (have huge hedges that I clip by hand).

First, the clippers are powerful. As strong as the bottom range clippers at HD. Theyve stayed sharp despite clipping branches that are too large and using them on denser wood than hedges. Second, no adjusting is needed. Where some clippers needed adjusting, these stay tight and in place. Lastly, theyve lasted longer than any clippers Ive owned so far! Dont be fooled by the cheap price, they're every bit as good as others on the market (have had 3 in the past 2 years). To top it off, shipping was fast - received these within a week of ordering."
5.0,"Love them. Just right for my vegetable garden and flowers.

Ninnies who want to cut down trees -- DON'T -- not made for that.

Whining about rust? See photo. Clean them and lubricate them. See ""2000 Uses For WD-40.""

Dull blades? Hard to believe, but some folks know how to SHARPEN them!

Good luck. Lovely tool.
And God Bless You."
5.0,got the job done !
5.0,does very good job
3.0,"They work, at first, but bend once they meet any medium size branch.  Would not buy again!"
4.0,it gets the job done and looks sturdy
5.0,These are great for trimming small bushes.  They are very sharp and they are not too heavy.  I am older and have some breathing issues and I was able to trim my decorative hedge by myself.
4.0,"What can I say, it's a hedge trimmer; it works!"
5.0,"These shears are great so far, but I've only used them a couple times this spring. They are incredibly capable of trimming even thicker (~1/4 inch) green branches on the larger shrubs which I thought they might choke on a bit. The grips are comfortable and the length of the blades allows you to shear large swaths of whatever it is that you are trimming. The hole on the end of the blade is a mystery to me; when this item arrived there was a tag secured using that hole, but surely it's not there just for that reason? If it has any real purpose I'd love to know, but it certainly has not hindered its functionality either."
1.0,Not sharp enough upon arrival.
2.0,"Hose kinks easily and frequently. The first time I used it, it kinked when I was pulling some hose across the cement while washing my car. Right where the kink was dragged the cement and made the house start leaking the very first day I got the hose. This hose is in addition to other hose that I bought over 10 years ago and still none of them have ever leaked. I feel taken and would never buy another product like a hose on the web without being able to lay my hands on it to determine it's quality first."
5.0,"Great hose very flexible, quality fittings. This is my 2nd Gilmour and very happy with both."
1.0,"Did not expect to receive a hose that says 'carcinogenic, wash hands after touching.  What ever happened to a plain rubber American made garden hose?"
2.0,"Time will tell, but it looks like an awesome hose.  The end where you hook up the sprayer was bent, but maybe it was just from where it was wound.  It has a lifetime guarantee and that is good enough for me.  I also bought A Gilmore Spray Nozzle.

Update 6/25/15  Does leak all over the place, it could be the end from where you put the sprayer on, but not what I expected.  It is also very heavy.  You need a special long nozzle to prevent your wrists from giving out or creating carpel tunnel.  I wish I had of gotten something else now.  I never did like the idea that the end was bent a little.  It is still awfully heavy.  Don't like it."
5.0,Good quality hose. should last a long time.
5.0,I ordered two of these hoses and they looked to be well made.  They unroll and roll back up easily and with no kinks.
5.0,Love this hose! No kinks whatsoever. I would but it again and again!
5.0,Great hose. Beats anything I've bought before.
1.0,"Tough hose....maybe too tough.
Works fine until you try to roll it back up, especially if it is cool out. You will wrestle this thing like it is a cobra...a real pain to store it.
Hate the thing....Flexogen NOT!
If you can leave out flat all the time than it probably would out fine for you."
5.0,"Haven't used it yet, but looks to be very sturdy and non-kinkable."
5.0,"Great! Excellent, just what I expected! and Fast delivery! A+++++"
5.0,work like a charm
5.0,Well made comfortable to use and work great.
5.0,Super sharp.  Don't know why they put a hole in one of the blades just to package it - but that doesn't affect the cutting ability. I use them for light duty work and I'm very happy.
2.0,Went rusty within weeks.
4.0,"Works great in my yard for trimming shrubs, trees and ivy. Rubber grips very comfortable."
4.0,Works good.  The blade are sharp.
5.0,"I have not used them yet, but they seem very nice!  Happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Lightweight and sharp. Terrific!!!
3.0,The blades are coated in machine oil. It has no meaningful nonstick coating whatsoever.
5.0,The hose is very sturdy and has a solid connection with no leaks.  Unrolls quickly and easily with no kinks.
4.0,"Great hose, just buy those little add on red rubber washers in the buy these together section. They made a bad choice with a small oval washer is all."
1.0,Purchased this hose because I read the good reviews.  Today I hooked it up and it leaked like crazy below the fitting that goes on the water connection.  I'll be tossing it in the trash and heading to Home Depot for another hose.
4.0,"I would rate this hose in the top 10 percent of the hoses that I have owned in my lifetime. It is well constructed and seems like it will be very durable.
It is very resistant to kinks, if you don't pay attention to the way that you unwind it or how you go around obstacles it will kink. I don't believe that there has ever been a hose made that won't kink given the right circumstance. The hose is thick walled without being hard to manage or excessively heavy."
4.0,"Long lasting, reliable.  Gilmour is a good brand."
1.0,Hose leaked at the crimp from day 1. I bought a repair kit for $7.49 to fix it. Not impressed.
4.0,"Very strong hose.  Packaging says it's all recycled material.

Would be nice if it came in different colors! ---"
5.0,Fast Shipping. Great Product
5.0,I will never buy another hose.  This one is amazing.  I can;t express how much I love this hose compared to the others I have owned.  It has not kinked on me ONCE.
5.0,Excellent
5.0,very happy with both products
4.0,HOLDING UP GOOD!!
5.0,Wonderful
5.0,"High quality, sturdy gardening tool."
5.0,Works like a breeze to trim flower stems!
1.0,Blades bit into each other on the first snip. Has done it numerous times and had to file out tge gouges. Blades also separate easily leaving tge branch stuck between the two. Managed to get 4 fruit trees and 5 berry vines pruned and they are junk.
5.0,Best Scissors. This is about the 10th pair I have purchased as we wear them out.
3.0,"These clippers are ok. They are easy on the hands, I was disappointed that the clip that keeps them closed broke on the first day I used them."
5.0,Christmas gift
2.0,Not very sharp right out of the packaging. Honestly expected better from Fishers.
1.0,"Initially, these clippers look and feel sturdy.  But within an hour of clipping long grass around my yard the bolt came loose and blades became dull and could only bend the grass."
1.0,Bought these in January. Used them probably 5 times since then. Kept inside. Even as new they weren't that great. Don't expect to cut anything bigger than a tiny baby branch. Now they are rusty and at this point can't cut anything. Very disappointed. Save your money and get something else.
2.0,These lasted about three weeks before they broke. Trimming shrubs and around the garden. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I dislike this product because it bend after trying to cut a dead branch. It wasn't my decision, as my girlfriend made me do it. She's very demanding of me and I wish to please her in anyway possible. Wink wink."
3.0,"Seems like a solid enough blade, but it has already started to show rust spots after only a few uses. It was left outside, but covered on my deck, so it wasn't exposed to rain or anything like that, and it is true that I also didn't wipe it down after I used it. But still, I expect to be able to use something like this a little roughly and not have it start to discolor and rust immediately.

It works well enough though, no complaints there. Blade is appropriately sharp and handles are comfortable."
3.0,They do the job okay. The packaging was ridiculous. Like 8 layers of tape and a security device that was super hard to get off.
4.0,"Sharp, light-weight, compact, great price"
5.0,"For the price, it is better than expected and does the job nicely."
4.0,Good Basic hedge shears for everyday use.  Sharp blades.  Eight inch blade is just the right size for about all your pruning projects.  I use it to shape my hedges and shrubs.  More precise that electric hedge clippers.  These shears are not intended to be used on branches.  Make sure you wipe the blades clean after each use and they will last a very long time.
5.0,Superior quality and work as expected.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"This was ordered in hopes of finally seeing some warmer weather, so it is still rolled up.  My last hose sprung a leak where it kept twisting into a
pinch..  I believe this one will work out fine."
4.0,Nice hose for small area. Seems sturdy and durable.
5.0,"My husband is very pleased with this hose. Currently, we are in the coldest part of winter and he can use it without getting frustrated."
4.0,Great looking hose but it turned out to not be the correct length that I needed. Realized I had to get a larger size. Returned it.
5.0,Doing great so far.  Moves fluid and no kinks!
5.0,Best Hose Made.  Doesn't coil or crease!!!
5.0,exelente
5.0,"yep, all those positive reviews are accurate.  For hard ranch work, in freezing conditions, this doesn't fail (we do store above freezing."
1.0,Very disappointed with this hose. Kinks very easily not of the best value
5.0,The best so far I've used in  a while.

5.0,This planter is a great help for small gardens.  I had been borrowing my brother's for several years & finally decided to get one of my own.  It is so simple and easy to use.  Everyone who has a garden should seriously consider this planter
4.0,"I am very satisfied with the earthway preicision seeder I bought.  We have used the seeder to plant 1750 row feet of vegetables and companions this spring already.  I have planted Punmkins, squash, gourds, dill, buckwheat, sweet corn, borage, and nasturtiums with the 12 seed plates I purchased.

thoughts:
This seeder seems to work best with a larger amount of seed in the hopper than you really need.  I do not think that dumping one seed packet in the hopper would work very well.  This is especially true for tiny seeds like carrots and radishes.  Luckily I overbought this year and it was not a problem. If you are buying 1/4lb at a time this seeder is for you.

With each different seed I planted it worked the best to set the seeder on a table, install a seed plate, dump some seed in, spin the front drive wheel watching the seed plate, checking to make sure it was picking up a seed or two in each little scoop.  Using this method I was able to plant everything from dill to nasturtiums.  I did not pay much attention to the names on the seed plates, just test run each seed with a couple different plates to find the best match.  I also found that selecting the seed plate that just barely holds one seed works well on the table, but not so good in the field.  if the little seed cup on the plate is almost too small, the vibrations of walking and the seeder bouncing over stuff will shake some of the seeds out.  Pick the next bigger one, you will be happier with the results.

This seeder works the best when planting in freshly tilled earth.  My garden is large 55 x 300, so
I drug the entire plot with a spike drag a few times to break up clods and debris before planting.  This seemed to leave a firm but yielding seed bed that planted nicely.

I did try and plant my sweet corn in some minimally worked ground, and found it hard to keep a straight row bouncing off the clods.

I plant 25 or more varieties of cucurbits, (pumkins, gourds, and squash). The seeds vary from the very large to very small, all of which are flat seeds.  This seeder's plate system seems to pick up seeds that are closer to round the best.  My wife and I, along with some advice from the local hardware store guy came up with a solution.  I removed the seed plate, and taped together a piece of plastic 3/4"" tubing with a funnel on top attached to a copper 45 fitting and a short piece of pipe that I flattened with a hammer so it would fit snugly in the seeder's drop slot.  After fitting the funnel/tube/copper elbow contraption on the seeder I just taped it onto the handles with electricians tape.  We marked the front wheel with a piece of orange tape to judge spacing, set the correct depth, and pushed the seeder.  My wife walked alongside me and plunked the seeds into the funnel when the tape came around.  The seeds would plinko through the funnel contraption and through the seeder, drop tube onto the ground and be coverd and packed just as a normal.  This mod saved my wife and I lots of time and bending over.  a 300 ft row took 10 minutes to plant.

All in all The $100 or so bucks I spent to get the seeder and the extra plates has been well worth it.  I will enjoy this seeder for many years to come."
5.0,"I used this seeder quite a bit back in the 80's & 90's. I had a large garden and it worked pretty well. I had a Ariens ""behind the tractor"" type tiller that prepared the soil perfectly. This seeder is not suitable for plowing thru hard, crusted over soil. Works best on well tilled, smooth soil.
As the level of seeds gets low in the hopper, keep it tilted slightly to the side to help the seeds continue loading in the plate. I watched the plate as I planted, if it came up with an empty pocket I would simply reach in the hopper and pull a seed up to manually load the empty pocket.
Seems mine did drop more than one sweet corn seed at a time, which I didn't really consider a big problem.
As a side note for new gardeners; it is very important to compress the soil on top of seeds such as carrots or they will not sprout. The rear wheel of this seeder does this for you. I once planted carrots by hand and none sprouted except where my tractor tire accidently ran over the row and compressed the soil. Would not have known what the problem was otherwise."
5.0,"Before we moved from Anchorage Ak, we gave away our well-used garden seeder to good friends, more because we wanted our friends to enjoy the simplicity of planting their own garden than because we no longer needed it. One year later we found ourselves on 1.4 acres in a town in MI, plenty of room for a garden. We once again needed a trusty garden seeder, which arrived from Amazon within two days. Great tool, great service!"
5.0,"I was looking for a faster way to plant my corn in my garden. I have a very big garden and very little time. I bought the Earthway 1001-B and when it arrived I had to put it together. That was very easy,I was glad for that. The next day I spent 4 or 5 hours rototilling my garden because to use the planter it needs to be freshly tilled ground. After tilling it only took me 20 minutes to plant the whole thing. It was the best gardening tool I ever bought. I recommend it to everyone that wants to make planting a garden very easy. And yes the earthway planter plants many other things not only corn."
1.0,I purchased this item.  I just tried it for the first time and the seed gets jamed behind the seed plate and it will not let the plate to turn or carry the seed to the hole to drop the seed down the shout.  I tired to plant sweat peas and it keeps jaming up.  I tried a different disk and it also jamed up.  Good idea but does not work.  Your better off to use a hoe and a rake.
5.0,"I really like the way this product works.  It is made well with most all parts being rust free which is great when you do gardening.
I had one just like this for many years and needed to buy a replacement.  I went looking for this one again since I was familiar with
the guality and use.  I would highly recommend it for those home gardeners."
3.0,"My family has used Earthway seeders since at least 1972 -- my grandfather had one, my father had one, and I have one. They work well, but you have to learn how to use it.

I find it works exceptionally well for any smooth seed; field peas, snap beans, and the like. It does NOT like any seed that is irregular, like the supersweet corns or sweet peas that are wrinkled. These seeds tend to not get caught up in the appropriate seed plates, pop out of the hopper, or get planted 5 or 6 at a time. The only solution I've found is to use a seed plate that is way too big, like the bean plate, which wastes seed.

Last year I used the bean plate to plant three 16x20 plots of sweet corn in two plantings (early and late). This should have used a pound of seed; instead I had to order another half pound before I could completely plant my last plot. I was not a happy camper; I had to thin my corn aggressively, because the plots were essentially double planted.

This year I planted my field peas and bush beans using the seeder, and am completely happy with it. I had minimal thinning to do, and my rows are straight and pretty. The corn, on the other hand....

I planted one plot in late April with the sweet corn plate. I went slowly, and watched the seed as it dropped. 2 here, 5 there, 3 over here, and lots of skips. I don't know how much more slowly I could have walked. I was concerned the plot was a total loss (along with the seed), if I didn't get a decent stand of corn. It's now about 4"" tall, and I've counted about 70 plants I'll keep -- but this plot should have had twice that many plants. They're horribly spaced, and I'm going to have to hand fertilize a lot of the plants.

I planted my second plot a week ago with the seeder, but was so unhappy with the number and spacing of the seeds that I went back with a hoe and planted it the old fashioned way. I managed to find and retrieve just about all the seeds the planter planted, but if I hadn't replanted I'd have had another half-stand of corn. If Earthway would make a plate sized like the bean plate but spaced like the sweet corn plate, that would be great.

So. If you're planting smooth seeds, it's a good planter. But don't throw away your hoe yet if you're planting supersweet corn."
3.0,This was good with some seeds but I ended up having to replant alot of seed. when it despences the seeds right it is nice for long rows. I had to move to another state and a smaller place so I sold mine. If is get a biger place I might get another one.
4.0,Works well for me. Needed to trim the Rosemary Bush. Thanks.
5.0,"These shears are very light and sturdy and they cut well.  Considering they are one of the cheaper choices out there, they are really a great deal.  The little hole near the point for hanging on a hook is a nice design afterthought."
5.0,Great product! exactly as described!
5.0,"Great price, and great product! I use them to trim my palm trees outside and they do a great job. The grips make it super comfortable and the little shock absorber between the blades is a very nice feature. I can easily recommend this to anyone looking for a good price on a trimmer that will get the job done and not take up a lot of bulky space in the garage."
2.0,"Worked great initially but these have rusted BAD in less than 6 months.  Both blades are entirely rusted, wouldn't recommend."
5.0,"A good product but not for heavy ""stuff"", small hedges calls for these trimmers."
5.0,Great for doing a small garden.
5.0,"Arrived quickly, as described"
5.0,5 stars!!
1.0,"Bought in March, used for spring clean up, worked well, now is July, I took
Them out to trim bushes and they don't cut any longer... Garbage ! Useless in long run, now I have to buy another pair..."
5.0,Easy to use gripper handles -- EXTREMELY durable blades! GREAT price on a top quality product!!!
1.0,"I usually love and trust Fiskars products, but this was one of 2 Fiskars items that we purchased at Christmas and that broke after one use. We were trimming some roses and the spring in the hinge slipped out. Now there is no automatic spring action to the shears."
4.0,"My elderly mother loves to garden however she keeps inadvertently throwing these in the trash or losing them among her cuttings. I continue to buy this brand for her, for ease of use and it does not dull quickly like others."
5.0,A gift...friend very happy
5.0,cuts well
4.0,works nicely
5.0,"What can I say, they do the job."
5.0,I love my Fiskars All Steel Bypass Pruning Shears! Makes pruning work easy!
5.0,"These are an exceptionally durable pair of hand pruning shears.  After more than a decade we concluded that for our yard work, it would be much more convenient to have a second set.  We attempted with some other brands, but found that they quickly fouled and lacked the leverage to shear through small limbs and leafy stems equally easily, so we invested in a second set of Fiskars."
5.0,Sturdy.
1.0,"Unless you're trimming twigs, these things are garbage. After about thirty minutes of trimming medium sized branches I noticed something felt off while I was trimming. So I look at my brand new pair of Gilmour Hedge Trimmers and the whole thing is bent and unaligned, and one of the stoppers is broken. These trimmers are cheaply made in China, do not buy. You'll save money buying something more expensive because I guarantee you that these Gilmour trimmers will break on you eventually, for me it was in 30 minutes of use..."
5.0,very satisfactory
5.0,Comfortable grip and sharp blade.
2.0,The stopper for the clipper was partially missing on one side. Will smash hands into each other when using.
4.0,"It has the word basic in the title, that's what they are. Nothing fancy. If you want the contoured grip and the spring loaded sheers that bounce back into cutting position, these aren't it, but then again, those sheers are more expensive. If you have light work to do, I would recommend this. If you have heavy work to do, these will kill your hands."
5.0,"Well made, Shockingly sharp.  Could also be used in a zombie apocalypse methinks."
4.0,light weight. easy to use. Im an older woman and used for light shaping o greenery. price was definitely good.
4.0,very functional and a good price
5.0,Super sharp and great quality for the price.
4.0,So far so good. They seem pretty sharp
5.0,Good hose.
5.0,Very happy and is great as an add on to my 100' hose.
5.0,I will buy more of these next summer.  They are lightweight and easy to move with minimum effort.
5.0,100% satisfied Thanks
5.0,It's better than previous hoses I have purchased.  A little thicker and more durable .  this year I am being smarter and I took the hoses in for the winter so they don't get worn from the weather
5.0,"This is a really nice hose. Heavy to drag around, but I expect it will last a very long time."
5.0,Great hose.
5.0,These are really quality hoses. I have used them for a year and they look and feel brand new still
3.0,I expected to get a hose that resisted kinking - at least it hasn't leaked yet!!
5.0,A very solid hose overall. The 500PSI limit and all weather rating has me hopeful that occasional freezing weather will not rupture this thing as it has other cheaper hoses in the past. Come spring I'll update this review with how it performs.
5.0,Well working clippers.
4.0,A little too lightweight and a little too short.
5.0,Fast delivery. Great item. Blades are a lil dull but I only had one plant so got job done
4.0,very easy to use
4.0,"I do recommend these hedge shears. The easy-grip handle portion is well-constructed and solid, unlike most shears. It has a nice big bolt keeping it together and the handle is made of metal with an easy-grip comfort wrap. It's probably less likely to break or become flimsy compared to other shears on the market because of the materials used. The shears did a good cutting job, but I expected them to go after tougher branches more handily than they did, which is the only reason why I'm leaving off a star. In general, though, I am happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I am a senior citizen and use these clippers to cut back tall, thick decorative/fountain grasses. These plants are too thick to use electric trimmers; however, when I cut about an inch width at a time, I am able to do a nice job with these clippers."
5.0,Very sharp ! Well worth your money .
5.0,Works perfectly and looks great!
5.0,Amazing tool. top quality!
5.0,Nothing fancy but it does the job well.
5.0,"Have remained very sharp and no signs of rust even after trimming right after a heavy rain.

Grips are comfortable, and cutting action is easy and smooth.

Will cut branches up to about a half inch with ease, but after that point you may want to look for a tool with more power."
2.0,Good quality but the price is too high. updated: AFTER ONE USED THE BLADE(BOTH OF THEM) ARE RUSTED. ITS NO A GOOD QUALITY AS I THOUGHT. ITS A POOR QUALITY. MADE IN CHINA.
4.0,"I have no clue what the blades are ""coated"" with, but it won't keep them from rusting. The blades are very sharp and the tool works as expected. Keep the blades oiled and the tool will last a long time. Leave it as you got it, and kiss it goodbye in a few months."
5.0,Very affordable and really works for the weekend gardner.
3.0,mine rusted very quickly. keep these dry and indoors when not using.
5.0,"Definitely doesn't work for over inch thick branches, but works for normal bush/plant trimming."
5.0,Good for small to medium hedges.
5.0,Yes happy with price and quality.  Easy to handle for women and has sharp precise cutting edge.  Would recommend.
3.0,"Not sure what these are coated with, but it sure isn't rust resistant. I left these out in my yard (Southern California with extremely rare moments of rain), and these were completely rust-covered within 2 months. Yep. Wow. That is some seriously rustable metal.

They still work, but come on. I've never seen metal rust like this ever!"
5.0,What can I say? These are awesome We use them to cut the bushes around our house... they do a great job. No complaints yet.
5.0,"Heavy duty, works like a charm"
5.0,So far they are fine. Time will tell.
5.0,great hose - strong but pliable - doesn't kink
5.0,"super strong, premium hose.  is very heavy, but that's to be expected."
5.0,No Kinks!! So refreshing!
2.0,"doesn't kink,thats all that's good about it.  the fitting leaked first time I used it. its so stiff,it won't rap up neatly. if you leave it stretched out,good hose.  a little disappointed.  price was right."
4.0,The hose works just fine but is not as flexible as I thought it would be...very stiff so difficult to maneuver and to put away.
4.0,"Bought this for one purpose only. Use it only with my ""Dirt Devil ND40015 Pressure Flex 2,000 Plus 1.6 GPM Electric Pressure Washer"". Mines in fantastic shape yet."
5.0,Strong durable hose!
4.0,"This is a beast hose! I'm not sure id say its kinkless, but it's sturdy and quite sure till last me a solid 5 years at least.  Might even be too sturdy for my auto-retract reel."
5.0,"To me, the benchmark."
5.0,Very sturdy and sharp enough. Makes trimming a really easy and quick task.
5.0,"Love these shears! Sharp and the ""cut"" out hard work ha!"
5.0,Work great for small trimming jobs around the garden.
5.0,"Simple, well-made, and do exactly what I need them to do...use them to prune my unruly ficus."
5.0,I use this brand and scissor model in my backyard for years and this is one of the more convenient scissors that I have.
5.0,"Easy grip and stays open while using,some shears latch close when depressed."
2.0,I've owned two pairs of these shears. Both have the same failure mechanism- the bolts holding the blades together bend resulting in the blade becoming misaligned and unable to cut. I only used the most recent pair for two pruning sessions before they bent. The gap isn't huge but it is enough that cuts are not clean.
5.0,"Just used it again today -  got access to new bushes and trees in desperate need of pruning! Anything over a 1/2 inch is a bit big, but I have cut pieces up to about an inch in diameter. Sometimes the shears stick but the un-stick easily enough with a few fist crunches. Very pleased, bought these because I loved the Fiskar scissors I bought in high school - they cut so cleanly... still do in fact!"
1.0,"I bought these based on fiskars name vs the equally highly rated but unknown Chinese brand. when received, i pruned 1 blueberry and two new Japanese plum trees (still in pots). The blueberry went OK, sort of, the blades splayed apart a few times, and at the end of making all of a dozen cuts on branches not greater than 3/8, the blade was nicked rather severely. I then went and trimmed my plums, removing some branches i didn't want. In the course of cutting a branch off at the central leader (<1/2""), the shears splayed apart and ripped bark down into the tree rather than the clean cut i was attempting to make. My $80 tree is severely injured my these cheap pos shears. Save the 10$ and use your teeth, they will make a crisper cut than this garbage.
Other complaints:
>Poor Ergonomics in the handle
>Return Spring is seriously undersized
>Lock mechanism feels chinsey, i suspect it would fail fairly quickly if it wasn't for the fact that the ""blade"" is more like a cow's molars after a single use.
>i seriously doubt they even bothered with any kind of heat treatment of the blade based on how fast it was damaged and dulled"
3.0,"Very cheaply made. It will get the job done for one or two times, but if you press hard, the blades will bend. I was able to trim the tree in front of my house, but anything larger than a pen in diameter will bend the blades/handle.

You get what you pay for. For $11 or so, I did not have high expectations. It was worth it for the money. If you want something that lasts longer, consider another option."
5.0,"Perfect for the job. My wife loves them and won't let me trim the hedges anymore, if you get what I mean."
5.0,Love them
4.0,work well and stable
5.0,Needed an inexpensive hedge trimmer to finish out the last couple months of the season & this really fit the purpose.  It works so well that it appears another season is in its future.  Would highly recommend.
2.0,"Unfortunately, these rusted over very quickly. By the second use they were harder to use."
5.0,"My last hedge trimmers (purchased at Home Depot) literally broke the first time I used them...after all of about 10 cuts.  I took them back...got a refund...but couldn't find any other clippers that were better, but still reasonably priced. We only have like 5 bushes to trim...I'm not spending $50 on clippers!

So, after reading a series of reviews for different trimmers, I chose these...and, so far, they're perfect.  They arrived faster than expected...they're sharp, solidly built....and they get the job done."
5.0,Amazing for gardener's
5.0,Perfect. light weight. does the job. Love the price.
3.0,"Not for use around anything thicker than 1"", they won't work.  But even around smaller branches and twigs you have to scythe once or twice.  Best used only around smaller bushes and shrubs.  You get what you pay for.
Word of caution, they bend easily.  I tried getting a couple thicker branches by crimping on them and twisting the shears left and right in circular motion and ended up bending them."
5.0,Great hose.
5.0,Great Hose.
5.0,Excellent hose. I use it every day in the garden. Tough and flexible. The ends are high quality brass.
5.0,"I don't understand how there are 30 one star reviews for this hose, it is the best hose I ever bought. I have left it outside for 4 months and not had an issue. It is the perfect length for my yard. I attach it to the spicket on one side of my house and can reach all of my yard. I love how there is a metal spring-type mechanism on the spicket end so it will not bend when you keep pulling the hose. The spring will also make sure that the end stays strong. I had a hose I bought from lowes previous to this and it lasted 2 weeks! This hose is solid, you can tell by the weight of it and the material. For all of the people who complained, are they aware of the Gilmour's lifetime warranty??? All you have to do is send both ends of the hose to them and they will send a new one!"
4.0,Seems to hold up a lot better than other hoses.
5.0,Best hose I've ever owned. DOES NOT KINK. Not too heavy. Love it.
5.0,works like a charm! It's pretty durable
5.0,Great hose!
5.0,"After buying and throwing away two other hoses, I finally found one that really doesn't kink!  This hose works beautifully.  The first use requires uncoiling, but after that, it works like a charm."
5.0,Great hose very flexible
4.0,I'm 5'1 and have weak arms this works great for me. It isn't too big and bulky and stayed sharp cutting down some huge weeds!
4.0,Excellent
5.0,Use to trim sidewalk weeds. Excellent.
5.0,In conjunction with a lopper I'm cutting everything in sight down
5.0,Great hedge trimmers for the price!
4.0,"You can't go wrong if you're among the budget-minded & you've got small weeds, boxwood hedge, ivy, or other quick-growing shrubbery around your property.

You'll have to use a little elbow grease on some fauna & keep the blades sharp but you should be pleased, I'd assume.

(Tip - Don't mistake these for pruning sheers, or larger tools meant to cut through wood branches. These are meant to shape up hedges & ivy,  mostly.)"
5.0,"Amazing for the price.  Half the cost of any other shears sold locally, and they work really well."
4.0,Very easy to use and seems drable
4.0,"I got these because I just moved into my first house. We are required to keep a neat appearance outside in accordance with the lease so I need something for bushes and shrubs. This was cheap and it is quite effective, the only reason why I didn't say 5 stars is because I found it difficult to cut some of the thicker branches, but in all honesty this isn't designed for anything bigger than a large bush. It does the job and if I lost it I'd purchase it again."
5.0,Exceptional steel quality for the price.
5.0,"Fiskars, THE cutting tool for distinguished tree cutters"
5.0,great stuff
5.0,very good
5.0,Great snips work well easy to cut branches etc.
5.0,Work great for pruning dead plants in pots.
5.0,Works great already trimmed the roses!!
1.0,these are cheap. you cannot cut limbs at a angle like they say you should. the blade bends and will not cut all the way through. if all your want to do is make straight cuts they work fine.
5.0,Excellent product! If you're in need of a good quality product I very highly recommend this one. Ive pruned my roses and Japanese Maple Trees with it. Definitely worth the money
4.0,good brand. quality product. cushy grips. works as intended.
5.0,High quality item - as all Fiskar products are. Good value for the price compared to box stores.
2.0,"I want to start this review by telling you this product is fairly unique. There are only 2-3 companies making this type of seeder and the Earhway model is very popular and well promoted. The idea behind it is great and allows any untrained person to plant row crops in a competent way.

The problem is the implementation, namely the cheapness of the machine. It is made from the cheesiest aluminum available that has no rigidity whatsoever. If flexes and bends in all directions at the slightest touch or wind blow. The holder that is supposed to hold the spacing arm when not in use, is a sad joke. It is made of plastic and held by two tiny plastic triangles that fit in holes drilled in the sides of the hadle arms. The hadle arms are the flimsy aluminum that can't hold their shape or position, and as a consequence, the ill-fitting plastic holder pops out every thirty seconds (on a good day).

In addition, the spacing arm is too light. It's primary function is to ride along the dirt and leave behind a line that is parallel to your first planted row. You are supposed to follow this line when planting the second row, and the next line when planting the third. In theory this is fantastic, but in practice, the arm is too light and barely leaves any mark in the dirt. Maybe at the beach it would leave a mark in the sand, but not in my dirt patch.

Summary: the tool is a great idea. It may work if you are in a pinch. However, there are better devices out there. Precision Products makes one that seems to be sturdier and is available from Home Depot, while Hosstools.com makes a great seeder attachment for their wheel hoe. If you buy the wheel hoe and the seeder attachment, you are set for life, being able to use the same tool for planting and for cultivating and maintaining your vegetable patch. Jhang TD1 is probably the Cadillac of seeders, it is super well made in Korea, can be chain-ganged into up to 12 units sets and can be towed by your ATV or tractor to plant multi-acre-size lots even.

Conclusion: If you can afford to spend 300 bucks or more, buy a Jhang Seeder (see Johnny's Seeds). If you want a more versatile tool, buy the Hoss wheel hoe and seeder attachment, the best bang for your buck. The Home-depot seeder and this Earthway unit are about the same in cheapness, but the Home Depot one seems sturdier. I am only giving Earthway 2 stars because they cheapened the materials to such a point that the unit is no longer a viable tool."
5.0,We just used this product last night and planted 5 rows of corn in under 5 minutes...Not to mention it also planted corn and radishes very well..This product is worth your money!
5.0,"I have been wanting to purchase a seeder for a long time, because it is difficult for me to bend over to put seed into the ground. I checked different options, even passed up buying at auctions because of the high price they brought. Fortunately I checked on amazon.com and was pleased with their price. Thanks' amazon!"
5.0,"I bought this item as a gift for my father-in-law and he loved it.  It requries assembly, but I'm not sure how difficult the assembly is because we did not assemble it before giving it."
5.0,"Purchased from Amazon, price was reasonable. I used this planter to plant my fall garden, it did a good job planting the small seeds. Was easy to put together,easy to use, wish I had had it to plant with last spring.
Would recommend to anyone that doesn't want too or need to bend over to plant."
1.0,"Quite a few things wrong with this unit, so here's a list...

Soil needs to be perfectly smooth - Rocks, weeds, compost will all collect in front of the seed chute and stop it dead.
It's not enough to disc your plot.  You need screened topsoil... or sand.

Does not cover seeds - the chain device is useless.  You have to go back over each row or the birds will get your seed.

You have to push down HARD to make the front wheel roll, and it still slips - It really should be made with a big heavy front wheel for momentum.  Think of a bicycle wheel.

Seeds pop out of the hopper - The motion of the disk in the hopper makes seeds pop out of the top.  When this happens, the hopper looks like a pop corn popper.  It's so ridiculous that I was SURE I lost the hopper cover somewhere.  Surely they would have thought of a hopper cover, right?  They didn't.  No cover.

The row marker is useless. Trying to use it just adds more drag to your already difficult forward momentum.  Forget this feature.

Sometimes it gets the spacing right, sometimes it doesn't get any seeds, sometimes it gets 3.

The only way I can see this working is in a DEEP, well defined furrow and then cover over it manually.  That will reduce this thing to just dropping seeds and poorly spaced at that, which I'm sure I can match with a little aim."
5.0,"excellent well made machine. Makes gardening fun again.
All Earthway products are well made.

  Duaneval"
5.0,"I was complaining to a fellow employee about trying to plant carrot seed given it's small size, when he started to tell me about the Earthway Seeder. He said that his family has been successfully  using one for many years now. So, after looking it up online, I decided to purchase one for next year. I am impressed with the simple but yet practical design of the planter. It is built to give many years of service and I am looking forward to using it next spring. There are different size seed discs that you use, which covers most seed crops that one would plant in a typical home garden. When I got it, I noticed in the paperwork, that it was built right here in AMERICA. So when you purchase this item, you are supporting fellow Americans. In this global day and age, that's getting harder to do."
5.0,"I bought this for my husband after we'd both spent a day doing awful things to our backs planting the first few rows of corn.  As soon as we'd put it together, he took it for a trial run.  The remaining 70% of the corn was all in the ground about an hour later!  It seemed a bit flimsy at first because it is so light, but it held up under use.

We haven't tried it with the other attachments yet, but it plants corn beautifully, albeit with some effort to push it through the soil.  The rows came up very neatly and look great.

I'm glad I bought it... saved hubby a great deal of back-bending and heat stroke!"
5.0,"Being a miserable , hardnosed mechanic type , i can say too ; you will like it !!
  NOW 2 small problems need be noted . first ; the soil has to be garden quality . it won't work in trash and clumps well (no planter can). good soil prep , near effortless planting.
  second ; for some reason certain types of PEAS have nasty tendency to grab, roll and POP out of planter . i polished the hopper surface and walk slower to good results.
  As for PLACING seeds , it works excellent !! depth easy to adjust , mechanism smooth , marker works , lite weight and strong enough .
 there are other planters bragging ""ALL STEEL"" .... now carry it back and forth thru a large garden and brag about your ""ALL STEEL"" ; no thanx .
  2 seazuns now and i am thinking of purchasing a SECOND unit and mounting both on toolbar behind my cub cadet ....
  OK , other seeds planted ; turnips , lettuce , beans , beets and all planted well . the ""Bayou Gardener"" has other tips on youtube very helpful.
  planter does over-plant, HOWEVER , it is GOOD as birds and germination problems are overcome .
  visibility of planter workings is FANTASTIC . you can watch each and every seed ; no guessing .
  well worth them $$ ;  ""buy it , you'll like it !!"""
5.0,good sturdy hose
1.0,"pretty cool, this hose came with an extra outlet, a hole about half way in the hose... so back it went, junk."
5.0,"This is by far the best hose I've ever had. It does not kink as stated and is made from a thick, high-quality rubber that has stood up to my abuse so far. Leaving it in the direct sunlight does not leave this hose soft or cause failures like I've seen on other hoses I've owned."
5.0,No problems so far.
4.0,I haven't had a chance to use it yet but it seems to be well made; the real test will be time and use!
5.0,"great hose, only had it a couple of days but appears to be extremely durable and doesn't kink"
4.0,Very Good.
5.0,This hose has been sitting out in the sun in my back yard for about 3 months so far with no issues.  Also the source water pressure is 120psi (caused another hose to burst) and so far no issues.
5.0,Greatest hose ive had.
5.0,"I bought four of these to add in series with tall misting sprinklers to water my hosta garden which is 100 foot long and 25 foot wide.  They are good quality, and I expect with the layout in place and no dragging around to different locations, the setup should last a good many years. Mostly they shall be covered by loose cypress mulch on the garden paths, avoiding trip hazards and UV deterioration.

I recommend you stretch them out on a warm day to allow the curl of the coil to relax, then drag them to the location. My spouse wanted one of them for the veggie garden, near the hose bib. He has an old hose that puffs up when full pressure is on it, not as high quality as these hoses. I think I may be gifting him with my 5th purchase of such a hose."
5.0,On time and works great.
5.0,"We've had them for a few months now and used them a few times. What can I say, they're big scissors. lol. They have cut well and held up pretty good so far for standard backyard projects."
5.0,"So far, so good. Forgot what it was like to have a solid, sharp pair of hedge clippers. Did my first yard trim the other day, and it cut through my hedge branches with no problems. Don't know how it will do on larger limbs, but I generally use my large limb cutter for anything larger than 1/4-inch or so."
5.0,"A true bargain.  Because of the price, I was a little worried I had wasted my time. But these are heavy duty and work just as well as the higher-priced versions. I am very pleased with the quality of this product and still amazed at the price."
5.0,"Durable, sharp, trims hedges.  It's not a hack saw, it won't cut branches off trees if the branch is thicker than a finger, but t does what it is suppose to do and is light weight."
2.0,Just okay... Wish I had sprung for one of the higher quality options.
5.0,They work as described and are affordable.
3.0,"I found mine a little more difficult to use than others. They weren't very sharp, and rusted after using them a few times. These were kept indoors inside my garage and still rusted."
3.0,Item works well to cut small branches and bushes but I was very disappointed after one use the blades started to rust.
5.0,It is easy to handle and has a sharp cut.
5.0,"Gotta love the Fiskars. As a gardener and/or pruner, I use the entire Fiskar line"
1.0,Barely used it for 2 months and blades already dull and can't cut flower stems as efficient anymore.
5.0,excellent tool
5.0,"These were a gift for my mother, passionate gardener...she speaks highly of them."
5.0,I use these almost daily.  They are sharp and cut cleanly.
5.0,I was able to cut through half inch thick with ease. Inch thick branches took some work but still got a good clean cut. The locking mechanism moved well and the hand grips felt good. I used them for about 2 hours straight with minimal hand fatigue
1.0,Complete rubbish.  The spring or whatever opens them isn't working.  I have to open and close with both hands.  A complete waste of $10 and I'm told I had to return in 30 days so now I'm stuck with them.
5.0,Not heavy but substantial enough for pruning shrubs and small tree limbs.
5.0,Very well made.. feels goo in hand
5.0,Nice
1.0,"I purchased this item online with the belief that the description, including the words ""Made in USA"" were to be true.  It is not.  It is made in a country that currently trades with the U.S. and does not mind that high lead content and poor quality are a hallmark of their exports(never mind their workplace or human rights records!!!)I would send it back, but that would only throw good money after bad.  Buyer beware, all descriptions are not the same and are not necessarily accurate...verify by phone first before you buy."
5.0,"My experience has been the complete opposite of the other reviewer's.
This is the best nozzle I've owned. The free, plastic version of this one that came with Gilmour's Flexogen hoses i bought ages ago lasted 10 years! That's why I sought out the metal version. I've had 4 of these ""new"" ones for 5 years now and they still work perfectly."
1.0,"Attracted to its nice design and the Gilmour name, plus the ""lifetime leakproof seal"", I purchased this hose nozzle. I had tried different brands and models before and all of them became useless after a few months, due to leaks and/or a failing trigger spring. The Gilmour worked like a charm for a year and then, like the others and for the same problems, became useless. Hoping I had purchased a defective unit - and still believing in the reliability of the ""lifetime leakproof seal"" - I got two more. All of them had the same ill fate after about a year. Very deceptive!"
5.0,"well made, keep indoors so they don't rust, work great"
2.0,broke after 6 uses.  not so great.  you get what you pay for.
5.0,Excellent quality!
4.0,"You get what you pay for, do not expect great things from a $10 shear. Works for leafy plants, not for anything you would call a branch."
5.0,"Sturdy, easy to use"
5.0,I have been using this for general pruning and am completely satisfied. It will cut bunches of twigs with one or two snips and seems like it is made to last.
4.0,These are $11 hedge trimmers that I ordered on Amazon.  They trimmed the s*** out of my hedges and did not break or mutilate me.  Solid buy.
5.0,"these things killed it, in a good way. good sharpness right out of the box, cut hte heck out of vines and ornamental grass that had become overgrown."
4.0,"Really good for the price, not sure how long they will hold up, but so far, amazing."
5.0,Good quality shear at a very reasonable price
4.0,"Really nice heavy duty hose, this hose will last years and years even in the Arizona sun and heat. I would have giving a 5 star on this hose, but I was spoiled after using those flex hoses, pocket hoses etc. but those hoses are worthless and do not recommend these types of hoses to anybody. I am hoping Gilmour will perfect that type of hose and make a light weight flex hose that will last, I know Gilmour could do this and this company or any other company that could perfect that design would make these types of hoses obsolete.
Don't get me wrong here this hose is great it is heavy duty, strong, sturdy, tough and will take abuse without failing, it is heavy tho.
Again this is a great hose and would recommend highly, ***** five stars."
4.0,These seem to be good hoses....heavy as heck.  LOL
5.0,Have had this hose for over a year. It has been outside the whole time and shows little fading. No kinks and no problems.
2.0,Saw the same hose in Home Depot for 29.95.  Priced too high
3.0,"We've always loved Gilmour Flexogen hoses and bought this one for its gray color.  However, after just a couple of years, this one kinks up and doesn't roll up nearly as nicely as our older green one."
1.0,This is one of the nicest hoses I have ever owned.  Too bad it leaks like a sieve right out of the box.  With zero pressure on the head (even though there is a spring) it is leaking a high volume of water.  No matter which way I put push/pull (or not at all) it leaks significantly.
5.0,"Excellent.  Does not kink like cheaper hoses, and coils easily in all temperatures.  Typical Gilmour quality!!"
5.0,Durable and flexible.  Works great
1.0,"This hose only lasted one summer season. This spring it developed a 2 inch split in the outer coating. It was supposed to have ""lifetime warranty"". When I attempted to contact amazon and the Gilmour Co. I found that ""lifetime warranty"" means nothing. Other reviews mentioned that they had returned defective hoses for replacement and had no problem as late as 2014. The Gilmour Co. has passed on honoring its warranty and Amazon will only replace within first 90 days. Makes me think twice about buying from an Amazon partner/3rd party seller."
1.0,"Very, very disappointed.  Kinks like crazy.  Not worth the money."
4.0,"Worked well at first, but already need sharpening. A little heavy."
4.0,"Easy to use, has the lock function which I like. It could be sharper, and take note of the oil in the joint as it leaks a little."
1.0,"I like Fiskars scissors, so I thought their pruning sheers would be equally good. But apparently they're designed without a spring to make them pop back open after you make a cut. You have to reach down each time you try to cut something and pull them back open again. I requested a refund, and Amazon issued one. Don't waste your time buying these."
5.0,"gift for my 88 year old mother, she loves them"
5.0,Sharp and easy to use.
3.0,its ok to use for the short term.
5.0,Great tool! Sharp and does the job!
5.0,Work well.
5.0,Very efficient - easy to get into smaller spots to clip. Nice and sharp.
5.0,These work great for pruning!
4.0,"I've only used this one time for some fairly small shrubs and not on anything thick. But they're easy to use and they have little rubber things on them to keep the handle from hitting your fingers or hands. I think for clearing a lot of shrub fast or trimming light shrubs they are excellent. Seem to be well made. They were a pain just to get off the card that holds them together when you get it delivered to you. I don't know why they put a hole in one of the blades but it does nothing for the weeding or cutting.

At any rate, so far I'm happy with them for what they are. I have other tools for heavier things like large limbs and thick shrubs. But I needed this to clear some clutter shrubs that seem to accumulate yearly and I think it will serve me well. When I've used it more, I'll try to do an update. For an inexpensive tool, I think it will be a good value."
5.0,"Very, very grateful for all your detailed reviews. Ironically, for once the cheapest & lightest is perfect for the small to medium trimming tasks!

Thanks to each of you for taking the review time. As a result,  I bought the right tool for a lifelong gardener now Turning 76 yrs but still capable to do my own yard & gardens but without it wearing me out.

These are perfect for your pre-teen & teen helpers to use also - clean cuts, no hacking, no need to use brute force for effectiveness. Great intro too for their own gardening experience."
5.0,ok
4.0,"A solid set of blades, useful for light trimming. They seem very durable, and are sharp to boot, with a great length. However, there isn't as much leverage to them as I'd hoped, for thicker branches. If you're going to cut anything thicker than about an inch in diameter, you'll need some different blades.

The blades are very comfortable to use, with the padded grip keeping them from slipping and cushioning the palms. If you have some hedges to trim, these are a great go-to."
5.0,works as well
5.0,Great buy for the price.
1.0,"Yikes! These are just awful. How in the world can you design cutters like this, that work so poorly? The handles flex so much when cutting that you end up bumping your fingers/hands together with each stroke. They cut okay, on thin branches, but unless you have tiny, thin fingers, and only do very light garden trimming, I would not recommend these. Perfect example of ""you get what you pay for...""."
5.0,"Wonderful item, very sturdy and high quality. Arrived very quickly, neatly packaged, well protected. Cuts very well. Highly recommend this product."
5.0,Just what I expected to receive
5.0,"I rarely write reviews, but just finished my most-hated weekly chore with these shears. In the past, I have had to do some, rest, go at it again. I just did my huge stand of shrubs and azaleas in the less than a 1/2 hour. The secret: my 75-yr old arms, weren't meant for longer heavier shears.  They're fine shears, just not for me.  These are easy to handle, sharp and much, much lighter than the others. I'm one happy old lady. They are not expensive, so even if they're a yearly purchase, that's ok with me."
5.0,"This is the best hose I have ever had.  Now have several around the house.  Always flexible, coils easily, and has smooth feel that cleans nicely when sprayed with water.  I have found it pays to buy the best!  Great price from Amazon."
5.0,"We bought a few of these last winter as we have a lot of hoses we use for irrigation water. They've been great - seem very well made and like they will last. Our irrigation water is ditch water and can have a lot of dirt and sediment in it, that can be extra rough on our hoses.

They're heavy but that's a good thing and they lasted through the winter still looking like new.
As our older hoses are wearing out we are replacing them with these. Recommended."
5.0,Good hose for the money
5.0,Good strong hose for the money.
5.0,this is as close to garden hose nirvana as I have ever seen. flexible enough to coil easily but shows no signs of wanting to kink. Only one season with it so far but if I remember to put it up before winter I have no doubt it will survive several years of use.
4.0,A great product that rarely kinks.
5.0,"Excellent hose!  Some light corrosion on the spring, but overall, fantastic!  Love this hose!"
5.0,Gaskets seal well. Pretty flexible.
5.0,great; very pleased.
1.0,Hose did not last past 4 uses!  I used it with a regular hand held nozzle and the hose quickly developed an aneurysm! Too bad because I really  liked the softness and feel of the hose and it worked great in the Suncast Aquawinder I bought.
5.0,"Best spray nozzle I have found. It is solid and holds up great, this is my second one the first the o-ring wore out and I have yet to replace the o-ring but otherwise it is like new."
5.0,great stuff
5.0,"Love the settings, love the grip, handle doesn't get super hot. I will say that it does break rather easily, but after the first replacement you start to learn how to ""fix"" it yourself, and realize it's not that it breaks necessarily, just that it might be designed to do this so that it doesn't break permanently!"
3.0,"I gave it an Its Ok Review. Mine Lasted a Season or so. Washing Cars. Garden etc. The Selector patterns are nice. I was Happy for that. But it started to leak this year. Been Useless considering I didn't want to get wet every time I used it. I hope they are reading these reviews so they might want to consider Re-Engineering a couple of parts inside that will Last. I have it apart right now and seeing if I can get more3 life out of it. Dont waste your time with the Warranty. It will end up cheaper to buy a new one. Lowes should take the broken ones, Replace them and send them back to Gilmour in Bulk. But that won't happen. The Warranty is Mis-Leading the Consumer and the Laws allow it..."
1.0,"If you enjoy purchasing a new nozzle every 1/2 season, this is the spray nozzle for you!
Buy 2 and you just might make it a year with them."
1.0,"You have to send $5.00 plus the original purchase receipt. I've had Gilmore Hose End Sprayers and many other products for 20 years. Never paid a penny to return it, usually to the hardware store I bought it at!

AND! The quality used to be much, much better. Have a couple of Gilmore products 10 and 15 years old still no problems. The new Bosch Gilmore items feel, look and last like something from China! Not even 2 year since new and it leaks in several areas due to failer rubber gaskets, and the spring is shot, Crap!

Never thought I'd say this...but the cheaper Chinese made knock offs are better made and last longer than Gilmore! What a shame!"
4.0,"The last Gilmore spray nozzle i bought was made in USA, this one in China. had i know that i would not have ordered. they have sold out like so many other companies. shame on them. will have to see though if it holds up as well as the USA made model."
5.0,"If this one starts leaking from freezes, you can take it apart and put it together and it will work. If the cheap plastic ones start leaking, they're finished, done for, need to be replaced."
5.0,"I had been looking everywhere around town for this Gilmour model........and no one carried it anymore, not even the local hardware store.........then, I thought, what about Amazon? Purchased two of them: one for this year, one for later. Love this Brand."
2.0,"I've had two of these nozzles.  They worked great until I dropped them on the driveway from the berm above and they bent (obviously abuse).  Prior to this, all I needed to do to keep them working well was squirt a little spray lubricant every now and then to keep the handle from sticking.  I wanted to buy a new one yesterday and found that they are no longer made in USA, now they're made in China and the packaging clearly states they contain lead and cancer causing materials and that you need to wash your hands after using.  No thanks.  I'm switching to a different brand."
5.0,I'm happy! Nothing fancy but the do the job!
5.0,These are very sturdy and so far have done a wonderful job for me.
5.0,I just got these yesterday and I couldn't wait to try them out. They are super sharp and work great! Now I don't have to be jiggled to death with my husbands electric hedger. Yay!
5.0,Can't wait to use them.
5.0,iT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR.  WORKS GREAT. GOOD BUY FOR THE PRICE
5.0,"great price, works great"
5.0,"whole on the blade is strange, but good and sharp cut :)"
4.0,"The quality was better than expected, I'm happy with them."
4.0,"My father-in-law puts trimmers like these through hell, so when I saw a pair with rust-proofed blades for a decent price, I ordered two right away. It's been several months now, and he hasn't sent them back to me for either sharpening or repair (which always happens) so I'm calling them a success."
3.0,i never left these outside or in the rain. but they are starting to turn brown already. its only been a couple of months since i made the purchase. other then that...they work great!
5.0,Awesome chairs they cut through 58 thick branches really good investment good pruning shears
5.0,Works well. Needs a little lube at the hinge.
5.0,what can you say bad about fiskars Nothing! Will enjoy using these this coming year as I lost my last pair somewhere in my backyard.
3.0,"I had hoped these were better.  They do the trick, but they don't open up very easily.  Ended up getting another one yesterday."
5.0,"Super sharp, they do a great job and these cost way less than in the store!"
5.0,awesome product for outdoor use
5.0,I have not used these yet but they seem to be very sturdy and sharp. I will update if I have any changes
5.0,"Haven't had these very long, but they are doing what I purchased them for, which is primarily to trim stems when I buy bunches for my home. They work well and feel sturdy."
1.0,Had a notch in the blade when it arrived.  I used it on a very small branch on a shrub and that put another notch in it.  Returned.
5.0,Great product.
4.0,These Hedge trimmers more than met my expectations. They were well packed and came early. They trim great with minimal effort and are very comfortable. You can't do much better than this for twice the price.
5.0,"These aren't necessarily the best, but they get the job done, AND I didn't have to go to Wal-Mart to get them. I hate Wal-Mart."
5.0,"I use these hedge cutters all over the place...on ivy, on juniper bushes, evergreen, leafy bushes...sometimes I even use it instead of my weed eater.

I have electric hedge clippers, but I grabbed these for quick touch-ups.  the other day I started with a quick touch up and ended up cutting my entire hedges and I swear it was easier than using my electric hedge clippers.  1. I didn't have to worry about getting my fingers chopped off 2. I didn't have to drag out the extension cord and 3, I had complete control and there was a satisfying feeling of cutting with shears.

I love these things and they keep on chopping despite the abuse I give them.  I am sure that at some point when I have to sharpen them it will be fine.  They have already been worth well what I paid for them."
5.0,"No substitute for having the right tool for the job, Good working tool. Easy  to maintain and sharpen Good value"
5.0,"and i don't have to go over each plant twice; the Gilmour does it right the first time.
i wondered if the 8 inch blade would be long enough, and it more than does the job.
you probably noticed the absence of a notch for trimming small branches: this cutter takes them down clean on the first chomp; no notch in the lower blade needed."
4.0,"Really like these--easy to hold, easy to use.  Sharp blades, cut hedges, small new growth trees, etc.  Work well and will buy again if needs be."
1.0,"The very first time I used this product, one handle of the tool broke and fell off. One of my fingers was hurt by the metal part of the defective handle, skin was peeled off. Pictures are below:

[...]"
5.0,"Although I haven't actually used these myself, all of the tasks on my honey-do list requiring the use of these hedge clippers have been completed. I can only assume they work sufficiently."
5.0,"I can't speak to the longevity of this particular tool, but given that it's made out of metal I am going to wager it will last a while if you treat it well. It cut the hedges no problem, didn't have any hangups or any problems, at all. The blade is large enough, but too large; these are worth the (low) price, easily."
5.0,It comes sharps out of the box so you can use it immediately. It seems to be built tough should last a long time. I think its a full tang so if the handles break you can replace them.
1.0,"I was so happy to see a metal body sprayer as I was sure this would last.  Two weeks use and it was spraying out all around the green dial.  Wow, that is worse than any sprayers I have bought before.  I got mine at Lowe's and will return it but I am very disappointed.

Update: I contacted Gilmour via email.  They said I could return it at my expense, and told me a $5 fee for warranty replacement may apply. It would cost as much to get a WARRANTY replacement as it would to buy a new sprayer.  Even then according to the reviews here the sprayer would still be a waste of money.  I will still return to Lowe's but was hoping they would have an explanation of why it failed.

So, Gilmour -- warranty worthless, product worthless."
1.0,"used this nozzle 4 times, put it away for winter, then reattached. mind you, i'm a 160 lb weakling. now it leaks from a crack above the threads. gilmor weasled out of the 'lifetime warrantee' by wanting $5 and the original bill of sale. i wrote them a scathing letter but did not get a reply. their product blows and their customer service stinks. more cheap import garbage."
1.0,"Is anyone surprised anymore when their product completely fails?  You have to ask yourself...when companies are not willing to pay people over 50 cents to $2 an hour to manufacture their products, don't you think they are building them with the cheapest materials.
This particular pos worked about 8 times."
1.0,The valve broke after only four months of use.  It would not shut off the water. Water sprayed back at the user.  No good.
1.0,"Great pressure, spray patterns and operation when brand new.  I bought three of these for my three hoses.  They all sprung major leaks behind the selector disk, the kind of leaks that get you very wet, after 3 to 4 months of use. This seems to happen with all of the select-spray nozzles I buy.  I think I will just buy the simple nozzles from now on."
1.0,The nozzle leaks like crazy.  I want to use the mist feature to water my new seedlings and ended up buying a watering can from Home depot.
1.0,"my nozzle is LEAKING.  I am so sick of buying things that don't work.  mine is less than 3 months old, and now all settings leak...  i greased the o ring and still leaks....what a piece of crap.  I have millions of dollars but cant get a good nozzle.  does anyone make them?"
1.0,"I bought two of these; eventually they leaked and I returned them for replacements under the lifetime warranty. Within a few weeks, the replacements leaked. I returned them and got new ones.  I have used one now for about three weeks, and it has started leaking. I have to turn the water off at the source, and turn it on whenever I want to water the lawn.  I am just wasting my time and postage money."
5.0,"Update: I purchased this nozzle over a year ago, this is my second spring with the nozzle. It is still working very well, no leaks, no rust, no complaints.  Note that I store it inside during the harsh New England winters.

I had a number of nozzles in the past, but this metal Gilmour select-a-spray metal nozzle and has become my favorite and I like it better than my other nozzles.

When it is attached to my hose it produces no leaks even when I leave the water faucet turned on. I have a very strong water pressure, and some older nozzles generate a leak even when I wrap every connection with Teflon tape. I like the springy feel of the handle as well as its ergonomic handle.

I am attaching a photo under customers photos which shows the 5 spray options available on this nozzles. I use the wide-gentle-spray in the garden most of the time. The fine mist will be great in my herb garden. And strong spray worked well to get the winder grime off my car.

This nozzle feels well constructed and has a nice pleasant to feel to it when you hold it. It has become my favorite nozzle.

Ali Julia review"
2.0,"I bought the metal version over the much cheaper plastic version because I thought it would hold up better. I dropped it within the first week of owning it and a piece inside broke and it now leaks as much water out of the head as is sprays.  Today I bought the same unit, but this time with a plastic shell!  I like the nozzle, and hopefully the lighter weight will keep that piece from breaking if it hits the ground."
1.0,"This hose was great for a year and a half. Then it failed, developing a hole. I know I have high expectations, but I expect a hose to last longer than a year and a half. I won't be buying another."
4.0,Good hose.
3.0,"I was looking for a hose that isn't very heavy-this one didn't make the final cut, but it's very good quality."
5.0,GRETA LIL HOSE AND DURABLE.
3.0,Because hose is 8 ply it is very stiff.  I'm use to 6 ply which is more flexible.  As a hose it performs well.
5.0,Best hose I have ever bought. Wish I would have bought this 2 hoses ago!
5.0,Nice hose.  Does not kink when unrolled for use.  It arrived promptly.  It seems well made and reels and extends smoothly.
3.0,Seems to be holding up so far (a couple of months).
4.0,Very satisfied with this product.
5.0,"I bought it because my dog destroy the last one, but my lovelly puppy had a hard time with this one so I recommend it for playful K9s ;)"
5.0,Good for cutting small branches. Just a nice set of shears by Fiskars.
5.0,Arrived as promised.  All Fiskars products are terrific.  They are sturdy and work great.  Met all my expectations and the warranty on all Fiskars products is the best in the business
1.0,"I had bought one of these 2 years ago and it was great. I bought another one recently, but it does not cut properly. It only pinches the branches and do not give a clean-cut."
5.0,Very easy to use and have a sharp blade.
4.0,Very good set of snips at a great price. They work perfectly with smaller branches.
5.0,well made. strong. I love it
5.0,Sharp and easy to use.
3.0,doesn't open automatically...so a bit difficult to use
5.0,well designed shear.
5.0,What's not to love about Fiskars! Great for clipping smaller branches and trimming cut flowers. pruning 4-5 yr old apple trees in my front yard too.
5.0,"What use to take me around 3 hours to plant my corn took me roughly around 10 minutes with this fine machine. I was a bit hesitant at first but decided to take a chance, so happy that I did, made me wish that I would have bought one years ago. After I planted my corn I switched out the seed plate to plant some radishes, done in less than a minute, crazy easy. One word of advise though make sure your soil is tilled well or it will mess up your furrow your making other than that I will enjoy this machine for seasons to come. No doubt that customers that bought this will have bigger gardens now that it's so easy to plant."
4.0,I used the planter to plant beans and corn. I got very near 100% coverage with it. It seems a little cheap and the plastic clip to hold the row marker up doesnt stay on. But planting was quick and easy. If you ever planted 50 ft of row by hand this will seem like magic!
3.0,"Have planted seed for 30 years by hand (corn,beans,cucumber,squash,) but when i purchased the Earthway 1001-B i got schooled on how to plant Efficiently, but if the ground isn't free of rock or clods u would be better off planting by hand because this thing just don't roll in bumpy ground. planted 4-150 ft. rolls of corn in less than half the time as usual same with beans learned to tilt the unit toward the holes in the plates so the seed will roll in the plates easier therfore eleminating empty spots in roll. Once u get started their are tricks that u will learn about it as with every other kind of machine. I'm going to try Beets in it this fall that should be Interesting!"
1.0,"i found this unit in my grandfathers garage and decided to give it a shot. after harrowing a field until the soil bed was just right i selected the seed plate to fit my seed and adjusted the depth on the planter to what i wanted. i had to bend over this thing and push with my full body bent on top of it, it did not go easily in my soil type at all. also, even with the properly sized plate it still dropped between 1-9ish seeds in some places and none in others, it is very inconsistant. im sure it would have been much easier in perfect sifted topsoil or somthing but not in the pennsylvania field soil i tried to plant in. im glad i didn't buy this product and would not recommend it to anyone without absolute perfect dirt, who doesnt care about seed spacing."
5.0,"It makes seed planting so much easier and spaces them apart perfect. very easy to use, just put the right plate on for the type of seed your planting and pour the seeds in and away you go."
2.0,"We are commercial farmers. We purchased this seeder to seed small areas where we were growing small scale organic crops. We have nealy perfect sandy loam and we till under green manures such as sorghum and buckwheat to ammend the soil. The problem with this seeder is that even the smallest scraps of tilled under plant material would build up in front of the plow of ths seeder and made it impossible to push forward without your body weight bending the handles.  We had to stop every 10 feet or so, pick up the seeder and remove the clumped up composted plant material before proceeding.  The other problem we had with this seeder is that small seed such as radish, turnip, collards and kale would become lodged between the seed plate and the body of the hopper which would grind off the outer layer of the seed or crack the seed.  The seed plate does not pick up seed out of the hopper consistently, so instead of have my sweet corn come up every 4 inches, I would have long runs of 6 or more feet where the seeder did not pick up a corn kernal from the hopper and seed it.  I believe if this seeder had a taller, heavier front wheel and more sturdy steel handles, you could probably muscle through turned under green manure better.  And they need to improve the design of the seed plates so a seed is picked up in each seed slot and seeded. Until the design is changed, this seeder is only good for use in light, weed/green manure-free sandy soil--it simply cannot be pushed in anything heavier without bending the handles.  In lieu of this seeder, I am buying a high wheel cultivator and hand dropping/covering my seeds by hand.  is picke up oneach revolution  d"
5.0,"This is greatest tool!
Works Great!

MADE IN THE USA  My money well spent......

I had looked at a similar one at the local farm supply store it was junk the seed plates would not stay in place it was made in China.....it was Trash

This Earthway tool works great in my tilled garden!  I have had NO TROUBLE WITH MY UNIT

This is a great garden tool"
4.0,"this has worked great for what I wanted it for. I planted three rows, about 50 feet long each, of green beans and one row of beets in about 10 minutes, after working up the soil. I was a little worried about planting the beets because of the seed size but it worked great and spaced the seeds uniformly. For $90.00 I should bought it long ago.

5.0,"Our neighbor has one of these Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeders and we borrowed his seeder&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earthway-1001-B-Precision-Garden-Seeder-with-6-Seed-Plates/dp/B00002N66A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeder with 6 Seed Plates</a>&nbsp;every year to plant our garden. This year we decided to buy our own seeder.  This seeder makes planting a garden so much easier than dropping the seed by hand or by other seeders that claim to make gardening easier (we bought another brand and it was not a good one; it would not drop the seed as needed). The Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeder has several seed plates that lets you plant okra, corn, beans and more.  It puts out just the right amount of seed needed in each row. We made a wise choice by getting it from Amazon.com because the price, in comparison to other planters, was a good deal for this planter, plus free shipping.  We are very happy with it."
4.0,I purchased the Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeder with 6 seed plates and found it fantastic when sowing my vegetables this year.  It saved a lot of time and spaced seeds evenly. I am glad I bought it.
5.0,Good.
5.0,"Love it, works great for my gardening ."
5.0,"Used these to prune my blueberry bushes, small fruit trees and my rasberrys. They worked great."
5.0,Love them. Hands are very sore after a full weekend of clearing fences.
5.0,Well made and easy to use. Fiskars makes good tools and these are no different.
5.0,"Great shears. I've always been a fan of Fiscars garden pruners, but my 20-year old pair just couldn't take it anymore. So, I order these new one, expecting the quality to have gone down. Nope. They work great, and it seems like they'll be going another 20 years like my last pair!"
5.0,works
5.0,excellent product
5.0,Cut through pine branches and roses with ease!
4.0,"It is winter so haven't used yet, but they look like they will work just fine."
5.0,"This hose is awesome.  It is definitely very heavy, so if you are looking for something lightweight keep looking.  The reason I love this hose so much is because it is easy to wind up in a circle on the ground.  The hose doesn't kink up and get all messy.  Great product and I actually just bought another one."
4.0,so far so good
5.0,good hose
5.0,These are the best hoses I have found.  Flexible but don't kink.
3.0,The hose is a little stiffer than I expected.  Okay overall.
5.0,"Bought these for use with Rain Train sprinklers and they work great. The trains rarely jump the larger size hose. These hoses are nice color, don't kink very easily, are light, and have lasted for several years now with no sign of wear. We are very satisfied."
5.0,Best hose ever!  We buy these when we can find them.. the coiled wire near the hose end really protects and gives it strength plus the hose is really heavy duty and long lasting.  These seem to last a long time and never kink.
5.0,Awesome hose!
5.0,Good hose that handles water pressure without stretching and relatively kink-proof. I've got 100' lengths and it can be a bit heavy when roiling (even empty) but for the price and quality there is value in the Flexogen.  I have another brand that is totally kink-proof and very light BUT it's 2 times the price.
2.0,Not the best purchase.
3.0,Dull after using only 3 times
2.0,"You get what you pay for, and I got some of the cheapest shears I could find. There is a gap between the blades that wobbles. I can't get a clean cut on even a small branch, and it feels like they are going to fall apart. It's not so much a snipping action as it is a awkward chomping until I finally get it to make a nasty, sloppy cut."
5.0,Trust fiskArs for the price it is a good productzzzzz there are better ones out there at a much higher price. I have many fiskArs product. As long as you know you get what you pay for. Will last you a long time if you look after it.
5.0,Great shears - expect the Fiskars name to ensure many years of outstanding service!
5.0,"Used them once and realized I should have replaced my old dull clippers years ago!  So nice to get a clean cut with so little effort. Love the Fiskars brand, always reliable."
5.0,work great and well made shears
5.0,work perfectly
5.0,"Christmas gift, wife was very pleased"
5.0,No complaints. Keeps the garden neat.
5.0,Perfect tool for florist or just for pruning plants.  Well made
4.0,"Great at not kinking up, and well reinforced ends.  But surprisingly short."
5.0,"Love Flexogen hoses.  I've always had one or two, and I even leave them outside in the winter.  Still just as good as new in the summer."
5.0,All-around pretty nice clothes
5.0,Great hose. Does everything as expected and does not kink.
4.0,"Since it's short, it doesn't kink"
4.0,Good Heavy Duty Hose! Just what I wanted. Mine was green which is fine. I would recommend to anyone. I use it at my Florida Home. Stays out all year. All I did to get rid of coil memory was to lay out the hose in sunshine for a few hours and it relaxed perfectly.
4.0,"Kinda short.. get the 50ft version.
The hose is strong and handles heat pretty well - I've left mine in the sun for a few months and it's still working fine.
The ends are strong and sturdy"
3.0,Knots up all the time
5.0,"What a macho hose. It's tough, rugged and heavy duty. It wreaks of quality. I'd say it's safe to say this is the best hose I have ever bought."
5.0,excellent hise

5.0,very good product... and it definitely Does the Job!
5.0,Quality product
4.0,Still sharp after two years of use. Has a few very small rust spots but a great buy!
5.0,These are great pruning shears!!! I've been using them to trim my pigmy palm tree and cut through the think fibers. Like the lock on the cutters and the fact they don't use an exposed spring. The handles feel good in the hand and have good grip. Would recommend these to anyone doing simple pruning.
5.0,nice and sharp
5.0,"cut garden back in fall in a flash, glad I purchased 2"
5.0,Worked well for my flowers. Sharp as well
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for---sharp, easy to grip but not overly large for my female hand, and the lock is located out of the way which has been a significant problem with other brands I own. Happy with these.  I definitely recommend."
5.0,"It is sturdy, works as intended.
Comfortable to handle too."
4.0,"Super hose from a super company that stands behind its products with a lifetime warranty.
Older hoses will get some kinks as they age.
This seventy five foot I find is the perfect length.
I have all lenghths from gilmore"
4.0,Great hose with great warranty that works. I have had to have three replaced over a 14 year period.
4.0,"I have about five of the flexogen hoses in different lenghts for each side of the house so I don't have to drag them too far.
I have had to use the warranty and it is painless. You send in the ends. They send you new hose.
Happy watering.
As they get older they do tend to kink, but that is usually after two seasons."
3.0,Did not use this yet. I just bought it to supplement another hose.
5.0,"A good hose.  Not kink proof, but at least it doesn't happen very often.  Also at one point it seemed like it was leaking at the end, but it just needed tightened."
5.0,"This hose was the perfect length to run to my 1973 Fleetwood RV that contains my lab. I keep it in a very secluded spot in the desert as to not warrant any unwanted attention and this hose seems impervious to the heat and the sun. I also use it to rinse off my level 3 biohazard suit when exiting the RV.

If only Amazon sold methylamine........"
1.0,You need to keep this hose completely strait or it will kink.
5.0,Exactly as advertised.  Nice light hose.
4.0,had to return b/c it was too short for my needs. otherwise great.
4.0,"The quality is fine although it is not as thick as two other heavy duty hoses I have. This means it is a little more susceptible to kink - though not bad. It may also be less durable but I have no evidence of that yet. It is fairly thick though and the fittings on each end seem to be well made and solid. Would've preferred a green or blue color but I guesd dull gray is acceptable. (Why gray???) Anyway, it's a good quality hose. All in all, it's a good solid hose. If it would've ben just as thick as my other heavy duty hoses, I would've rated it a 5."
5.0,WORKS GREAT.  MAKES GARDENING SIMPLE & KEEPS FROM BENDING OVER(A HELP FOR A 60 YEARS OLD YOUNG MAN).  WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING THIS SEEDER.
5.0,My husband recently used this seeder planting our garden and it was very easy to use. Last year we borrowed a seeder that works differently from this one. It was used to push the seeds in one at a time. This one was much faster and easier to do. We plan to use this one for years to come.
4.0,"If your planting several rows of garden veggies, ie: corn beans, etc, this is a great time saver. You must make sure soil is well prepared before using. Large clumps of soil or wet clingy soil will retard your machines ability to function properly. A good piece of machinery for the the weekend gardener."
5.0,This saves alot of back bending trying to plant seeds.  Wish I had bought this years ago!  Planted 100' row of peas in less than two minutes.  Key to this product:  ground needs to be soft and no clumps and buy a half pound more seeds than you need to keep it picking up the seeds to drop.  Wouldn't want to plant without it.
4.0,"I used the Earthway seeder for the first time this week, planting peas. Made planting MUCH easier than seeding by hand. My only complaint is that the chain that drags along to cover up the seeds didn't quite do its job - I had to go back and cover by hand in most areas. This could have been due in part to having slightly damp soil conditions - maybe it would work better in drier soils. I think I'll look at replacing the chain with a heavier one to get more drag. Other than that I'm stoked on it. A simple little tool for a great price."
1.0,"The plates do pick up the seeds very well. It is flimsy and lightweight. If the plates do pick up seeds, they pick up way too many and over plant your rows. Save your money, this thing is a piece of junk."
4.0,"We had 1/2 acre of newly tilled, grass sprig-filled, sticky, clumpy clay and needed to plant corn and black eyed peas. The planter did well under the circumstances - better than expected, in fact. The pea plate, however, was too large, planting too many peas, too close together. The corn plate was a good substitute. I wish it weighed a bit more, but I expect it will do better as the years go by and we improve the soil. In the ""old"" garden where the soil is fluffy and full of organic material, it was PERFECT. We got the best germination and stand of green beans ever. since they were planted uniformly at the proper depth. MUCH better than the dibble! AND faster - no aching back and 240 feet of beans were planted in less than 5 minutes."
3.0,"Very lightly made, because handle will flex when going through heavy soil. The row marker needs added weigh to do its job unless you have light sandy soil."
5.0,This was a gift for my son-in-law.  We have a planter like this and he liked it so much he wanted one.  The different seed plates make planting various seeds a breeze.
3.0,"I think this works best if your garden dirt is very fine, friable, and you've run a compacting roller over it.  In any kind of cloddy or uneven soil, the seed depth varies enormously.
I also had trouble getting an even distribution for some seed sizes but maybe my seeds were odd-sized. I didn't try experimenting with different sized plates - just used the plates labeled for the seeds I had."
5.0,Good quality
4.0,These work. I can't say they work any better than my last pair when they were sharp so I'll just say I like them.
5.0,Excellent product for the price.
5.0,Perfect for the gardening I do.
5.0,Great clippers. Easy to use.
3.0,not very easy to hold
3.0,So far its ok. Will see if it last as long as my old one!
5.0,"a daily user for sure, thanks."
5.0,can't wait until Spring to use it
1.0,Horrible! The first day i used them to trim some roses the blades started sticking and the lock mechanism would stick. Then the handle broke!!!! Super cheap and total waste of money.
1.0,When was I supposed to have bought this? I didn't buy it. I've never had one of these.
2.0,"The hose is not at all what I had in mind.  I purchased, despite I bought another hose I loved last year, mainly because the reviews were so positive.  But upon receipt, the hose is MUCH heavier than I wanted (and what my other hose that I love is) even without water.  I purchased 100' long so yes, there is alot of hose to lug around, which is exactly why I wanted a light hose.  Plus, it doesnt seem like the hose material itself has much anti-kinking protection.  In all fairness maybe less than a cheaper garden hose, but not at all kink free like my other hose.  My problem is now I paid for shipping to me ($12) and I don't want to pay to ship it back.  It is all just alot of money wasted in shipping i could have put towards the hose itself.  Well that was my mistake but thought to share in case my experience can help others avoid same mistake.  I was really hoping to love this hose but I regret purchasing."
4.0,I would buy again I just wish it was a little lighter in weight. However in comparison to other light weight or feather weight hoses it is far superior in quality to what I've had in the past. Ii find it does not kink up when extended the 100' .  All in all a very good product.
4.0,"A expensive hose but It really does not kink so far.  I found that even the best hoses at the big hardware store chains will kink even if they are advertised as ""non-kinking"".  I had the Gilmour for only a few months so I will have to wait to see if it continues to be a truly ""non-kinking"" hose."
1.0,This is a very difficult product to manage in the yard without tearing it up when walking around with it to water. I returned it and bought the coiled hose and a skinnier hose.
2.0,"This hose is a pain! Unless you leave it out in the sun it is a bear to deal with. Very rigid hose. It still kinks and when it does it's twice as hard to get the kink out as a regular hose. I don't see much ""flex"" in this hose."
4.0,"This item that I bought on Amazon, was great for what I wanted. I don't think I could do better? So go ahead and give it a change. SW"
1.0,"Very Dissapointed with this hose. it is not any better tha the one i threw away. Very heavy, and it is not kink free. I am worn out trying to unwind and drag this monster hose anywhere. Right now it was a total waste of my retirement money. Still looking for a light weight Kink free hose. this one is terrible !!!!"
5.0,"This hose is great, with plenty of flexibility and ability to roll up smaller than the average hose. Good buy."
5.0,I have had several of the X Hoses. They are not worth the money. This hose is great. So much better water pressure and the 100' i bought covers what 150' of the xhose. This is worth every penny. I can water my yard in half the time.
2.0,"The throughput is too low.  I have a metered water timer.  When I set the time to 2 hours using a oscillating or pulsating sprinkler, it takes 2 hours.  With this Rain Train set to 2 hours it takes 4 1/2 hours to apply the same amount of water.  It takes twice as long to water the same amount of grass.  The other problem I've noticed is that yellow stopper device that turns off the rain train doesn't work.  The tractor sits too deep in the grass and catches the bottom side of the stopper.  I have not been able to get this thing to stop yet.  The tractor turns well until it is dragging a lot of hose behind it, then it tends to go off track(hose) more easily.
Where I have found good use for this sprinkler is my side and front yard.  For small areas, the rain train is ideal. You can set the sprinkler to water an area as small as 15 ft and up to 55 ft.  Of course, the bigger the area, the less water that gets applied per application."
5.0,"My goodness, I actually enjoy watering the lawn!!  The traveling sprinkler works great:  I set a course with the hose, dial in the tractor speed, adjust the spray nozzles for the desired spray diameter, and let it go.  After it runs the course, it automatically shuts off.  The downside:  pedestrians want to chat about it (does it really work?  is it actually moving??  where'd you get it??).  But EVERYONE who sees it, smiles.  Have a great summer.

November 2011 Update:  Nearly 10 years later, my tractor sprinkler is still going strong!  No problems at all.

April 2013 Update:  Ran it for the first time this season.  Still works as good as new!"
5.0,"This traveling sprinkler was gave to me as a gift 10 years ago . It is by far the very best on the market today . I would highly reccomend this sprinkler to anyone . Fathers day is just around the corner , this item realy dose make a great gift .."
4.0,"I have a older model of this product,that I have used for 30+ yrs.,but now needs a part ,and I am trying to get. I would like some help in where to find it . Thank You. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT."
5.0,"this is awesome...beats any other sprinkler on the market & makes them obselete.  I'd give it 10 stars out of 5 if that were possible. I just set it out and forget about it.  It shuts off automatically so you don't waste water.  The only problem I have had is with angles of hills and dirt patches...if the rain train is travelling side ways along a hill and it is too steep, it has a tendency to tip over, but once you get used to where it can go without tipping over, it is not a problem.  Also, do not have it (the ""wheels"" run thru any dirt patches as it will get stuck in the mud that develops from the water). This is MUCH, MUCH cheaper and easier than getting an inground sprinkler system and I highly reccommend it."
5.0,"After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.
I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.
Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.
Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!"
5.0,"We have used one of these for about ten years with great success.  The tractor can even follow the hose around gentle 10' radius curves.  The little ramp clips on the hose and has a folding ground spike to keep it  from slipping.  When the tractor reaches the ramp, it pushes a shut off  valve on the belly of the tractor.  Very simple and effective.  Part of our  ramp finally snapped off, but it still works.  We've never had a problem  with the tractor.  The adjstable spray wands allow you to regulate the size  of the area covered.  I suppose it can drag about forty feet of hose before  it slows it down.  That probably will vary depending on the depth and  density of your turf and how straight the path is.
You won't be  disappointed; this is a time-tested classic!"
5.0,Got these for my mom because I have other friskars and she LOVES it!
5.0,Great product.  Quick delivery.
5.0,Works as advertised
5.0,Does the job!
5.0,Great quality for the price!
5.0,"Good quality, sharp, excellent product for gardening."
1.0,Blades caught and had a hard time closing. Also wasn't very sharp. Would not buy again or recommend.
5.0,"This is my second pair only because I misplaced the first pair. They have a great grip, nice sharp and sturdy blades and my first purchase never really showed signs of wear before it disappeared. I held out from buying a second pair because I assumed my first would show up but to be fair, there really isn't a downside to having a backup pair of these pruning shears."
5.0,"Love it! Very simple.
No spring loading to open the scissors, but that is fine: I wanted simple shears.
I don't see how this one will ever break.
And also easy to take apart for sharpening."
1.0,"Poor quality tool , blade bent early on. Would not recommend this tool !"
5.0,A 50' hose is too small for my back yard.  This add on hose is great quality and flexible.  The Arizona sun has had no effect on this hose so far.  Good purchase.
5.0,"This hose does everything that you want a hose to do, it doesn't kink, it is very sturdy, doesn't leak. I think I am going to buy a couple more for my yard, appears to be very good quality!"
5.0,"This hose is wonderful, the best ever.  Can't recommend it more highly.  Coils nicely, and it doesn't kink.  Thank you."
2.0,"I really researched this product before I bought it unfortunately I am disappointed
It kinks every time I use it.
Thankfully my 3 year loves to get the kinks out as I'm watering the bushes"
5.0,"I'm hoping to get a good many years out of this hose.  No kinks yet.  Heavy hose, to be sure.  Satisfied I am."
5.0,Great quality and value for a smaller size hose.  Very happy and it will be easy to store and wind up.  Didn't need it to travel long distances but wanted something right by the flower bed next to the water faucet.
4.0,"The hose works as advertised, but there is a plastic smell that emits from the hose whenever you turn the hose on for the first time in a couple of days."
5.0,This hose has been very easy to unroll and use.  Even when cool the hose been very easy to handle.  I would recommend to others.
5.0,Buy it here! This product is a very good value and a good brand. I think you cant go wrong if you buy it here!
3.0,It did not have the rigidity that I was hoping for.  Tends to collapse when running water down a moderate slope.
4.0,"I used this seeder last year to plant over an acre of sweet corn and beans. It sure beats bending over for every single row. The only concern that I have with it is that the arm that lines your next row needs to be just a little bit longer. I planted Golden Queen corn which gets fairly tall and wide, and even with the maximum length, they are almost too close together. It is hard to get down the rows without getting hit in the face by every on that plant. This is not a hard fix, though because you don't have to use that piece and can lay off where you want your rows to be with some string or measuring tapes and plant however far apart you want.
Overall, a great product for the small gardener and I would recommend it to anybody!"
4.0,"I just tried this out, and it seemed to work well.  I planted some garlic seeds using the pea plate, and some cilantro seed using the beet plate.  The ground hadn't been worked for several weeks, but was still fairly soft.  The planter went right through it and seemed to be picking up the seed pretty well.  I was afraid that it wouldn't work very well with a small amount of seed, but I put a 2 oz packet of seed in and it picked it up just fine.  It appears to be well made and I hope to be able to use it for many years.  Be sure you put the correct plate on before you put the seed in the hopper, though!"
4.0,"This garden seeder is well thought out and includes some nice little features - drags dirt over the seeds and has a row marker - which add to its utility.  The only drawback I found was that the dirt you plant in must be worked up until it is smooth and fine or the seeder is hard to direct in a straight line and doesn't make a consistent trough to place the seed in.

Other than that this is a sturdy, easy to use tool which anyone with a large garden will want to own."
2.0,"Not happy with this.  It was really not what I was looking for.  Having bought it, I will have to keep it and put it in my yard sale.  However, it arrived well packaged and in 2 days after my order was placed.  That's was I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE so 5 STARS for the seller.  Just not happy with my choice of seeder."
5.0,"This is a terrific tool and a must-have for any home gardener. It makes seeding a medium to large garden almost effortless. It takes less than 5 minutes to set it up for operation and less than a minute to change out the seed wheels for a variety of seed sizes. There is no bending over, just walk along behind the seeder and it performs exactly as detailed in the product description. You do have to select the correct seed wheel for the type of seed you want to plant ~ that is the key to using this great tool. I planted tiny-sized seeds from lettuce to beets, all the up to large field corn & bean seeds, with ease!  This would be a great gift for any gardener on your list."
5.0,"We liked the way the seeder worked in our garden. Using it saved us from putting to many seeds in at one time, so the seeds went further. The seed plates that came with it were great. Thanks"
1.0,It did cut the furrows to desired depth but it was hit and miss sowing beans and small peas. It did not sow the small dill seeds but periodically. I had to go back and sow the misses by hand and then cover the seeds with my rake.
4.0,"I received mine a few days ago, planted some feed corn this evening. I had finely tilled soil, but lots of weed root ""trash"". It worked well, I cleaned the trash at the end of each 35 ft row. The filling chain did not do a complete job, but dragging a garden rake over the row finished the job. The entire process took about 15 minutes and my back didn't suffer from bending over. When I plant sweet corn, I think I will open the ground with a hoe and use the seeder to drop the seeds and mark the next row. Covering the seeds is perhaps the easiest part of planting. This tool takes the painful part of planting away...bending over to place the seeds at the correct distance. I saw no recommendation for feed corn, used the sweet corn plate and watched it scoop and drop seeds. Oh yes, it is plastic and aluminum construction, light weight, but I would not like to push more weight, anything heavier would have to be powered. Having retired from engineering, I can see a lot of engineering time in the seed pickup plate/dropping mechanism. This puppy is good bang for the buck, waiting to plant my radishes (pain in back!!). I tested seed selection/dropping with the front wheel on the stand, turning the wheel by hand. I saw it drop individual seeds, was satisfied that I had the correct plate. I will do the same with all other seeds. A new user will need to do a dry run with no seeds to get the feel of the machine. The front wheel requires contact with the ground and at the same time there is drag from the row marker. The row marker worked very well for me, made a  well discernable furrow in the ground. Happy with this purchase? My back says YES!"
5.0,I love this product and recommend it to anyone planting a larger garden.  I adapted it to the toolbar on my garden tractor and it works GREAT !!  no more stooping over planting those seed one by one.  The planter is well built and has adequate seed plates for a large variety of seed sizes (I am mainly using plate #22 for sweet corn and peas).  I believe that it will me last a long time with proper care.  I shopped around and found the best deal on Amazon.com
5.0,The Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeder with 6 seed plates is a real joy to use.  Highly recommend it for any gardener.
1.0,"I got tricked by the good reviews. Very cheap, the cutting blade bent after 5 min of use, I didn't trim any branch larger than my pinky finger, and these didn't hold up. Try again."
5.0,very good
5.0,Cuts well and easy to store....
5.0,love it
5.0,"I'm happy with the quality of these and their ability to cut through larger branches. I had to trim back my neighbors tree, and these worked great."
4.0,"Very good action & easy2 use.  I've had these pruners B4.  Overall durability is my only concern,  but no complaints here."
3.0,Bought these so I have two shears. Seem to always misplace them for a while. This pair seems a little flimsy compared to my 5 year old pair. Might just be imagination as they worked fine.
5.0,Just what I needed.  Easy to hold and sharp!
1.0,"Always have thoughts Fiskars products the best. I have been a florist for 40 years, requiring the best of hand pruners, sissors and knives. They worked well at first,have sharpened them,several times. They are not the quality they used to be."
5.0,These are great--smooth action and relatively easy cutting--even for my arthritic hands
5.0,I bought a cheap hose that didn't hold the pressure after 2 days.  This bad boy hold the pressure and doesn't leak.  Its not even expanding.  Great quality hose.  I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length.
5.0,This is a high quality 8 ply hose. I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past. A good choice in hoses.
5.0,"Very high quality hose.  The ends are thick metal, not stamped sheet metal, so it's likely to last a long time."
5.0,I have always used them and was thrilled to find them here. These are the best hoses and have a lifetime warranty. Would not buy anything else.
3.0,"Admittedly, I really haven't had a chance to use it much.  Mother nature has taken over here.  The third time I used the hose, it kinked on me.  I was so disappointed.  Hopefully it was just a freaky, one time thing, but somehow, I doubt it."
1.0,"Had it fora few weeksl already have as any holes (3 as of now); maybe I got a defective one, but whatever the reason, this is one time the amazon reviews did not hold true (for me at least)."
5.0,"I bought two 25 foot instead of two 50 foot.  other than that mistake on my part, this is a very good hose."
4.0,"The hose seems sturdy, in good condition, it does not want to lie out stretched though, it still exhibits ""memory"" of its being coiled
for shipment."
5.0,SUPER RUGGED. This hose is amazingly tough and can take a ton of abuse and kinks. Worth the extra cash.
5.0,"It's only been a month, so I can't quite speak to durability yet, but I THINK that this is going to be the best hose purchase I ever made.  I've uncoiled it several times in a way that would kink other hoses....no problem with this Gilmour.  Very impressed so far.

I've now owned this hose for 2 years.  Still great, still a 5 star product.  If/when I need another hose, I will buy another of these."
5.0,"THESE ARE AWESOME!! Cut like BUTTER!! I bought my Mom some flowers and came in town at the same time (unplanned) and wanted to cut them for her to get them into a vase and she had nothing so I was like this isn't happening again lol so I hopped on amazon and ordered these. Thanks for the reviews and you guys were right, they are awesome"
5.0,great gift
5.0,great!!
3.0,I bought these to use on flower stems when creating flowers for my niece's wedding. They weren't as precise as clippers designed for floral work. They are okay in the garden.
3.0,"They cut well however, they need to be oiled often otherwise they don't open and close easily."
5.0,Heavy duty. Great design and quality. Sold at a price that's hard to complain about. What else can be said?? Five stars all the way for these Fiskars pruning shears.
5.0,Works like a dream!
5.0,I've always admired the quality & lasting power of the blades they put in their products! Cut my entire hedge with these in only a few moments! The heavy gauge steel is higher quality than most & stays sharp a miraculously long time! Able too trim thick stems with ease that didn't exist in my old alloy shears! They deserve a seven star rating! Thanx!
5.0,"tried it today to cut roses, very sharp!"
3.0,Product was not as well constructed as I was expecting from a brand like Fiskers.
5.0,I bought this hose to go with the Aquawinder and they are great.  It doesn't kink and it comes correctly and rewinds correctly.
4.0,"Sturdy, well made and does the job. Does not kink and it just feels right when I am doing any job where I need a hose."
2.0,"We have had this hose for almost a year now, and we are very disappointed in how this hose handles. It is a very heavy hose and is made well, but when 75 feet of 5/8"" hose is full of water it is very difficult to handle. The hose will loop up and tangle. I had a gilmour hose at my job as a school groundsman about 20 years ago and it was nothing like this hose. That is why I bought this new one. But have been very disappointed in how it handles. We are looking for another hose that is easier to handle. Maybe it is the length of 75 feet, when we should of bought a 50 foot hose. I don't know what the problem is, but sorry I cannot recommend it for another purchase. The hose is made extremely well and I don't for see any problems with it lasting a long time. Its just very hard for a 60 year old weak man to handle."
5.0,"I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )"
5.0,"Awesome hose! Thick, but still rolls up perfectly on my plastic reel. Buying another one for the back yard too."
2.0,The ad states it is flexible in cold but boy does it stiffen up when cold water is run through it. I would not waste my money
5.0,"So far so good.  Haven't used it a lot this wet Spring. Nice and light and relatively no kink.
Would recommend it."
1.0,This hose was not secured properly at the nozzle end.  I hooked up my sprayer and the fitting simply came out of the tube.  Very disappointing.  Amazon was excellent at refunding my purchase price.
1.0,Bought 4 of these hoses thinking they were guaranteed for life. One of them had a blow out of the internal hose and water leaked in between the layers- It blew up to 3 times it's original diameter. Don't waste your money. I've had cheaper hoses that lasted longer.
5.0,"Exactly what I needed - light weight garden hose, and just 25 ft. in length (which is difficult to find in local stores).  Color was different than pictured, but that does not matter to me.  It's a good quality, 25 foot hose and it is light weight so I don't need to worry about lifting it. I received a medium gray hose, which is actually better for my purposes than the light green pictured; it pairs well with my 50 ft hose, but I would have kept it regardless.  As mentioned, it is exactly what I needed but could not find in my local stores."
5.0,Worth to buy.
5.0,Was able to take apart a tree branch of about one inch diameter very easily. Excellent sheers!
4.0,I thing it's a great product would give it a 5 star if it was 6.99
3.0,"No as sharp as the same item I bought before from local stores. Thought this would be a better value, but back to the local hardware for a better pair."
1.0,Terrible Fiskar product. They will not cleanly cut any stem. The shears do not spring back open after attempting a cut. I have to force them back open with a finger before trying to cut again. Look for another set of pruning shears!
1.0,Terrible product! Cut only one branch and the shears does not work anymore. It does not even close.
5.0,"These shears have a nicely balanced spring, lock and unlock smoothly, and are sharp enough to do the job well.  I'll likely be buying more in the future."
5.0,Perfect
3.0,"I have used these to trim my Palo Verde, zinnias, butterfly bush and some ice plant, and they are already not cutting as well. Kind of disappointing."
1.0,"I am new to gardening and was very excited to have a good pair of clippers. These were a disappointment.

These clippers crush rather than clip. I ordered two of these clippers for my garden. Neither of them cut well. One of them does not reopen after squeezing to clip. One needs to manually reopen the clippers. I regret this purchase."
3.0,"I've had one of these for two planting seasons.  It has a plastic plate that scoops up seeds from the bin and drops them down through a drill below the soil line.  Different kinds of seeds require their own plates.  Because the plate is made of plastic it flexes and seeds can get trapped behind it.  I think metal plates would work better.  You have to keep a close eye on the mechanism to catch it when it malfunctions, which it will, trust me.  I find it difficult watching the mechanism closely and running a straight row.  I have used it to create a furrow and then I manually drop the seeds into ground.  I had high hopes for this that weren't realized."
5.0,I really have not even openred the box yet as it is a christmas present for myself. I have been looking for one of these and all have been about 100 bucks and additional seed plates cost even more. I will not be using this item for several months as now it is about 5 below zero!!! I hope for the price it will work well and if it doesn't I am not out much money. Good luck if you plan on purchasing!
5.0,"This little machine is a true time and back saver for me. My garden is in a river bottom. I till the soil and it becomes very soft. I let the Planter create the rows as it easily rolls through the soft soil. It puts all the seeds at same dept and germination is high. I think if the soil was hard with clods and rocks it would probably not work as good. I borrowed one from a friend this past spring, used it with great results, and then purchased one recently. For me and my application, it can't be beat."
5.0,"I was so pleased with this product.  Well made, easy to put together.  I haven't used it in the garden yet, but it looks like it will be a gem."
2.0,"I think the product is well over priced for the job it did. It dropped to many seed's. It called for one seed every 7"". this planter dropped 5 to 8 seed's every 7"". It does not cover the seeds as stated. If someone wants one for half price, I have one for sale. Just remember there is nothing precise about this machine. Don't waste your money."
4.0,"Garden seeder works pretty well.  It is easy to change the seed plates and easy to use in the garden.  The marker for the next row is very convenient although it misses some spots as the line goes along.  The only downfall I have is that the spacing of the holes on the seed plates is too far apart.  It leaves about 9 inches between every couple of plants.  I had to go back and insert seeds into ""spaces"" after plants began to grow."
3.0,"Pretty good seeder IF you have very loose, well tilled soil.  Not heavy duty and useless in clay soils."
3.0,"the thing works well  and would of been better had i rototilled the soil into a powder  but i did not  therefore the planter had a hard time and the seeds did not get covered well  but all in all great buy and good for your back ,,,"
5.0,"Got this for my husband. He dearly loves it, sure saved his back when planting the garden.....Thumbs UP"
5.0,This is a great product hands down. I planted my garden this year in a fraction of the time. I lent this out to a friend and he's planning to buy one now too. I have to buy the extra seed plates yet but it definately user friendly. If I was to add anything to make it better I would attach a cable to the row marker so you don't have to bend over to flip it.
5.0,"This is the 2nd time I have ordered this type, length, and thickness of hose for my gardens.  (One for the front of the house and this one for the back of the house).  It is a great product and true to it's claims - no kinks, thick, and very sturdy.  I love it.  If you are needing a hose, order this kind."
5.0,Excellent product does what it says but is not cheap sorry that it needs ten more useless words due to you
5.0,"These hoses totally rock and the lifetime warranty is outstanding, along with great customer service.  We accidentally damaged one of the brass fitting ends of the hose and we cut it off and sent it to Gilmour.  They quickly sent us a brand new hose.....no questions asked.  Why would you ever buy any other hose????  Kenny C.......Oregon"
3.0,"I bought this because I went cheap and bought a low quality hose last time. Constant kinks became leaks. This time I would get one that would not kink. Sadly, I misread the description that says it does not kink near the faucet (I though it was kink free). While watering some trees last night, the hose kinked. Then it kinked again at the same place when I pulled it to the front yard. The hose is stored on a winding spool, so i do not see where the storage would create this.

Would not buy this again."
4.0,"The hose is amazing. Great for use in a heavy duty reel, doesn't flatten and doesn't really kink easily either. The problem is with the price - you can get this exact same hose (UPC and all) for 32 bucks from walmart. Not a problem with the product, more a problem with the pricing on this item at amazon."
4.0,"i like this holes i bought because its flexes but what i should have notice was the size 5/8 is to fat and hard to handle
for me anyway! but i would not recommend this to women that are small like me. I  would the 3/4 its probably better to handle for the length i bought, which is 100 ft > don't make the mistake i did, check first with your local hardware store and feel for the size you
want. again i do like it for i'v only been using it two weeks."
5.0,A 5/8-inch hose moves much more water than a 1/2 incher.  I have owned Gilmour products before and found them to be high quality.  Same here.
3.0,"I've been looking for a softer hose that won't kink up when washing cars.  This model by Flexogen does a really adequate job of not kinking up, but the weight does force you to fight the hose quite a bit."
4.0,"Can't get too excited about a hose, they all make you nuts till they get broke in a bit and get some sun to wear them down. We are in Colorado, so when the hose is cold it is till a monster to get rolled out. Plus the water temperature going through still is burrrrrrr.  Gonna give it some sun time and we will get along better.  I have purchases the Xhose & the Xhose expensive black version in hopes to have a good hose for the deck. DON""T get them!  They all explode and can hurt you like me!  Stay with this type. Safe & will last for years!!"
5.0,I love this hose!  It is flexible and Doesn't kink.  I have tried so many hoses and this one is the very best of the bunch.
5.0,Good product. So far so good. Also good buy.
5.0,Very sharp. It makes gardening easier.
5.0,Super sharp and cuts branches like butter.
4.0,Good tool
5.0,These are the best shears i own they do not rust and are a workhorse i keep them with me all the time as i do gardeing everyday and go to different sites
5.0,These have been great. They easily cut the branches of the lemon tree I bought them to prune.
5.0,Luv it
5.0,"Works great.  Quick snips to prune some of my bushes and trees here and there, can't beat the price.  After all, its fiskars, not a knock off thing.  I'm sure I'll lose the things before they break/wear out/need sharpening!"
5.0,Great product
5.0,"I have a planter box with Jasmine and Gardenias in it. It is pure overkill to pull out my electric hedge trimmers to maintain it. These shears do the job handily and store nicely afterwards. They are really sharp, so medium sized branches prove little or no problem. These have become my ""go to"" shears for quick touch ups in the yard."
5.0,"I ordered teh Gilmour Flexogen 8-ply hose 5/8 inch by 100 foot and that is what I got. However, the picture shows a grey hose and I received a light green hose. At first I was unhappy with the color so I went out and purchased a ""commercial grade""hose, gray in color thinking that all ""commercial hoses"" should be the same.  Well after about 45 minutes of attempting to get the gray hose on the new hose reel, I gave up as the ""commercial hose"" kept crimping up. So, I opened the Gilmour hose and installed onto my new hose reel without any problems., I must say, the Gilmour hose is an excellent product and I would recommend the purchase to anyone."
1.0,"I purchased this in 2 sizes: the 25 and 100 foot. Both arrived looking absolutely nothing like the photo. I sent the 25 foot back (arrived first), but got the same wrong item again from Amazon. Now both 25 foot and 100 foot are here and are all wrong. Looks nothing like the photo. Absolutely frustrated I guess I'll just keep the wrong items. Ugh! Key differences include should be steel fittings, but they are brass. Should be coiled wire at the end, but it's plastic. Should be grey in color, but it's a light green. Doesn't seem as heavy duty either. Wrong item. Not as pictured. FRUSTRATING AMAZON! Get it together."
1.0,"Looks nothing like the photo. Ordered 2, sent the first back, received same wrong item the second time. Frustrated I'll just keep the wrong item. Ugh! Key differences include should be steel fittings, but they are brass. Should be coiled wire at the end, but it's plastic. Should be grey in color, but it's a light green. Doesn't seem as heavy duty either. Wrong item. Not as pictured. FRUSTRATING AMAZON! Get it together."
5.0,"I have purchased a lot of hoses in my day, but this one tops all of them.  I have a large yard and find myself pulling the hose throughout the yard with me.  This hose is durable, yet not heavy.  The water flow is full and consistent.  The extra money I spent on this hose was well worth it....and it's guaranteed for life!"
5.0,hose is exactly what I expected.  I ordered a 50 foot one after I got this one and was happy
5.0,...who needs to leave home anymore?...work from home and we love our home...do not like to venture out to go buy little bits or large bits...Amazon is making life a lot easier...even our UPS drive is a Amazon Prime member...ha!...
4.0,"Very good quality hose,  I do not expect to buy another.  Carries water from spigot up to 100 feet away with aplomb."
5.0,"Not much to say about it.  It's flexible, doesn't kink, color looks nice.  Just got it so hopefully holds up well."
1.0,THE HOSE I RECEIVED IS GREEN NOT GRAY LIKE THE PHOTO SHOWN. ALSO THE KINK COIL IS NOT ON THE GREEN HOSE. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HOSE....
5.0,"I have seen a lot of hoses which are reputed to be non-kinking but do, in fact, kink.  The Gilmour Flexogen hose does not kink,"
5.0,"Great for thick stems/roses etc.  Fiskars doesn't necessarily have the toughest/highest quality products out there, but they have a top notch warranty.  I buy their products since they have such a great warranty and customer service that I don't need the need to spend more on other brands.  I know if I break the tool they'll cover it no questions asked.  Fill out the claim and send a picture with it.. good to go!"
5.0,"I love every Fiskars product that I've ever bought.  I tried another pair of Gonicc bypass pruning shears, and they are good, but I like Fiskars better."
5.0,Good quality for the price. Sharp blade cuts easily. Handle could be improved for better grip.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,"As expected, prompt shipping."
5.0,Happily pruning away! Easy to use and well made. Id had my last pair for over 20 years and lost them.
4.0,"I use pruners a lot, these are pretty good"
5.0,"sharp, strong"
5.0,I depend on the Fiskars brand to be reliable and work well. These pruners have been great for the small pruning tasks I've had to do. They provide a nice clean cut.
5.0,You can't beat the quality of Fiskars products.  I use these to cut brush in the pasture.
5.0,Christmas gift
5.0,"Well built, sturdy pruners. No play in the mechanism. I do wonder if the plastic-y lock is going to fail over time, but it seems like a low enough stress part that it probably shouldn't be an issue. Certainly isn't yet, so I won't let that affect my review."
5.0,great product
5.0,I wasn't sure about how the quality of these would be since they were only $10 but I was very happily surprised. They work excellent I have never had a hard time cutting any plant or flower that I have used them on very excited to finally have Good sheers to use on my garden. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Fiskars is always high quality and these are no exception! And WOW, what a great price compared to in the store!"
5.0,Great product. Ive used this for many outdoor projects including pruning and haven't had any issues. Product is exactly as it advertises. Love the safety close as well.
5.0,Very easy to operate
5.0,These work nicely to prune my rose bushes. The grip is comfortable and the blades are sharp.
5.0,The price and product are excellent!!
5.0,"The item arrived in timely fashion and perfect condition.  I would buy from this merchant again.  This is a great garden tool, perfect for pruning, and very sharp."
5.0,"Did a lot of research prior to purchasing! Great price! Beat all competitors, specially Home Depot, Lowes, & Ace Hardware!!"
5.0,"This hose is exactly as described, soft to handle with no kinking and very good quality construction.  I plan to purchase a few more of these hoses as my other ones either wear out, get damaged or frustrate me enuff with their kinking and hard to handle feel!"
5.0,I live in an area with freezing temperatures in the winter. This hose works great when I need a short hose outside when it is freezing. It is well built and works great for my purpose. I drain it and keep it in the garage after use and I always have a thawed hose.
4.0,"Well built and doesn't kink, It gets a lot of use in my front yard, and would definitely buy their products again."
5.0,Hard to find a sturdy hose of this caliber in the winter time around here.  Much needed for my horse farm.
5.0,This hose is worth the money. Have used it for over 3 years with no problems. The hose does just what it says it does.
5.0,"Have had this 2 seasons now.  It is holding up very well in all kinds of weather.
not showing any kink marks or wear n tear.
Will buy more when I need one."
5.0,"I have gone through so many other commercial grade hoses, all have popped or leaked after less than 6 months. I have had this hose for over 8 months and with heavy daily use I have no leaks, no kinks, no holes, no tears, no complaints! I'm excited about the warranty, although I doubt Ill ever have to use it. I have bought several for all around my house."
2.0,"When I use a garden hose, one thing bothers most is hose kinking. This one is no exception, it kinks. I found another brand ""Water Right"" which is  very light weight and made of high quality material. The best part is it doesn't kinks!"
2.0,"I have horses and rely on a water hose twice a day.  I had gone to our local farm store and purchased three different hoses all which leaked and required repair.  I was excited to find this ""last hose you'll ever buy!""  Needless to say the very first day I used it, it leaked where it connects to the house."
5.0,"The lawn tractor is exactly what I needed for my yard.  Generally, it completes its circuit and stops itself but, occasionally, will jump the hose and either get stuck and dig a whole or will wander into the neighbor's yard.  However, I suspect user error in laying out the hose contributes greatly to the tractor's escapes.  When I have not angled the hose too sharply or wrapped it around a tree by accident, the tractor moves smoothly and slowly along its track, providing a good soaking for my grass and trees."
5.0,"Works like a charm. The only thing about it that gave me pause is the cut off underneath. It's a bit too sensitive. If you use a large diameter hose and the grass is soft, the wheels will sink down and the cut off will stop movement. I had to finally put some cut rubber washers in the spring to stop that. After that it worked great. I just can't leave the house and leave it running."
5.0,"Easy, dependable, great!"
1.0,The wheels broke the first time it was used. Very disappointed.
5.0,Fast shipping. Love the traveling sprinkler. Thank you
4.0,"Would have given it a 5 star had the speed moved a tad faster. My water bill jumped 3 fold compared to my other sprinkler. Oh, well, right? Lol"
1.0,"This is a great concept, but ours does not move. We have to go out and push it which is the exact reason we bought it....so we wouldnt have to move it. Dont waste your money. Huge disappointment."
5.0,"This is the coolest thing ever!  I told my husband this would never pull our big hill, but it did!!  You can barely see it moving but that is perfect for our new sod.  I think it will make the difference in our whole yard this summer.  And our little chugger is a conversation piece and fun to watch and keep up with.  Very heavy with big wheels that keep it going over rough terrain.  You gotta get this!!!  Super!"
4.0,"This is a good sprinkler for the money. Set it up and forget about it. Fast speed works great putting down enough moisture in between rainfall. Slow speed is great if no rain is in the forcast.
I would have gave it 5 stars but it doesn't pull 3/4"" hose very well at all. Your best bet is to buy the cheaper medium weight hose and it will pull that entire length  (100ft +). Would not recommend this for newly seeded lawns, only established lawns. It will get stuck in mud easily and tear up seedling grass.
Had this for three years and still working great."
5.0,perfect machine i expected
4.0,Nice and easy to use.
5.0,I keep them on my zero turn mower to take care of pesky branches that try to snag me. Can cut through surprisingly large branches.
4.0,Well built. Good value
1.0,Ordered this based on great reviews but you can barely trim a small oleander bush without the blade dulling and bending.  Should've read the bad reviews also before buying.
4.0,"These are decent cheap pruning shears.  They loosened up after some use, which was unexpected.  If you prune a lot, spend more for a good pair.  If only occasional use is requires, these will work."
5.0,These are great.
5.0,Pretty hard to beat Fiskars
4.0,"Nice product, fast delivery"
3.0,These pruners are good quality.  The handles open widely which is awkward for small hands.
5.0,Good deal for the price.  It's sharp and handy
1.0,"I thought this would  be nice, but I think its was money wasted. Its to hard to push in the ground,if it was sand it might would be easy ,but in dirt it to much work. I would rather plant my hand."
1.0,"I read all of the reviews and had mixed feelings about ordering this garden seeder; based on most reviews, the product was a little lacking.  I am glad to report that most of the reviews were pretty much on target.  This thing doesn't work well for any of the seeds that I tried:  okra, corn, english peas, brussels sprouts and chives.  If I had it to do over, I would just continue planting by hand.  However, to be fair, I'm going to try and plant my purple hull peas.  I plant a lot, so we will see if this thing really works on anything."
5.0,"We really like our seeder and are impressed with the USA made quality like what we used to find in products back in the 50s & 60s before the made in China junk flooded the market. It has a heavy gauge aluminum frame and many of the parts are durable nylon rather than cheap plastic. The wheels roll on steel bushing shafts and all the bolts are respectable grade 5 quality requiring a 1/2"" & 7/16"" wrench for assembly. The 1/4"" drive belt is more than adequate and the 12"" dia cleated drive wheel is big enough not get lost in our soil and prevents skipped seeds in the row. The seed plates are amazingly easy to change, no tools required. The seed depth and row marker are easily adjusted by loosening large wing nuts with your fingers, once again, no tools needed. The handy kick stand keeps the seeder upright so we don't have to be concerned about seeds spilling out like we would if we had to lay it on its side. I first saw this very machine advertized almost 20 years ago so it has certainly stood the test of time. I have been an organic gardener for 33 years and consider this fella a real back saver and time saver. Well worth twice the price in my mind!"
5.0,a nicely built product--easy to assemble.haven't used this one yet but my brother-in-law has one that he has used for the past 5 years and he is totaly satisfied.
5.0,"We plant a large garden every year, and still home can most of our vegetables. Planting corn and beans, and having to hoe to cover them up is time consuming and back breaking, depending on how much you plant -  I planted 4 rows of corn, about 100 yards long each in around 15 minutes - it was great!  If you want to seed a little heavier in your corn rows - just run over it twice - Love it!"
5.0,"This product does what it says I have a 3,000 sq ft garden and it made the planting a pleasure. I am looking forward to using the fertilizer for sed dressing the  rows. I think I will take another look at the additional disk for seeds. to get a broader selection. This also worked very nice for planting an annual boarder plants in hte flower beds"
5.0,"worksgreat , keeps my rows straight and seeds spaced correctly. plenty of seed plates to allow for planting about everything."
5.0,Hi; you know this product save's alot of work faster gardening time get more done. any small gardener sould have one of these save's trying to lay off row's with hoe's are something else this planter does it all.
1.0,"Very Poor recommenadtion:

Don't be fooled into buying the Earthway Precision Garden Seeder, thinking that it is a quality piece of machinery.  Cheap, cheap, plastic TV trays are made of better stuff.  The hopper and wheels are made of cheap black plastic, the rest is made of very flimsy and thin  aluminum.  The whole thing does not weigh enough to make the wheels turn under its own weight when you push it.  You have to bear down on it to make it roll.
It will not stand the test of time in your garden.
It will just be another broken do-dad laying around with weeds growing up in it in your yard.
If all that is not bad enough, the seed plate for corn picks up anywhere from two, to four, pieces of sweet corn seed in every seed cup, leaving you with four, to sixteen, seeds of corn planted every 9 inches.

I was dis-mayed at the poor quality of this product and dis-heartened at the poor planting results.

I am currently using a home-made planter consisting of a funnel attached to a three foot length of 1"" PVC water pipe via hot glue gun and I am very satisfied with the results, and the precision at which the seeds are placed as I drop them one by one into the funnel and down the length of PVC pipe.  The funnel cost $1.00 at Dollar Tree.  The PVC water pipe cost .35 cents per foot.  Total price = $2.05 + TAX."
1.0,"I just finished planting 35 x 25 ft of corn, and my back is killing me. I thought the reason I bought this thing was so I wouldn't be in pain after planting. The main problem is it's lack of weight, thus requiring your garden to be free of anything but fine soil and very level. I had to grab it at both ends and force it through the soil as I walked sideways all the way down the row. Then I went back and re-planted the corn that was laying on top of the soil (20%)."
5.0,"Not too much to say about this-- the hose is solid, doesn't kink easily, and allows fast water flow. I thought I had really low water pressure at my house, since I only used the coiled hoses, but once I got this hose, the water flowed at around double the rate. I've had one for about three years, and I've ordered a couple more over the last year or so (for the front and back yard). I don't anticipate any problems from them."
5.0,"This is a great heavy-duty hose that's ideal for our tropical weather.  Although a bit on the heavier side, it doesn't kink.
Basically you get a much better hose for the price!  Noticed that Amazon has it pictured in gray...though the one I purchased is in green."
5.0,"I am using this short hose in my greenhouse to replace one of the coil type, which was constantly kinking and cutting off the supply.  The is a great hose -  stays fully round and does not coil. I have several of this brand outdoors and they last forever, so this one will be around for many years"
4.0,"This garden hose seems well made, the couplings are sturdy, and the hose is flexible.  It will kink like most hoses if twisted the wrong way.  It's somewhat lighter than heaver rubber hoses I have owned.  For general use around the home is seems to function well."
5.0,"I am an avid gardener and must use hoses daily. I will only buy this brand even though it seems a little expensive. I have bought a brand that looked identical guaranteed kink proof and  it kinked the worst. It's not worth the headache of every other brand that kink, leaks, easily punctured or split, all seen on TV are cheap crap with the diameter so small the water pressure is reduced to useless. I know this is wrong but I leave my water on with a shut off valve at the end of the hose and this brand still lasts for years with harsh treatment."
5.0,"Bought this hose for various projects around the house. The only regret I have is not buying the 50' section... Oh well, you live and learn! Great quality hose though and I will be purchasing the same one but longer."
3.0,"This hose definitely does not lives up to it's claim of ""The last hose you'll ever buy"" since after 18 months mine is falling apart and needs to be replaced. It has bulges everywhere and the connection at the bib leaks regardless of how tight I turn it, and I just recently noticed a leak in the middle of the hose itself (I don't know if I stepped on it with a rake or what). To be fair, it has been through two Phoenix summers where it gets above 110 degrees and I haven't always turned it off at the bib so it has held 75 psi of pressure for weeks at a time. But still, it could do better."
5.0,"Top quality hose. I bought this, then traded my father for his because he needed the 100ft. His hose its a piece of thin junk. WHen you're buying something thats used often or used to do a job thats not exactly fun, you will not regret paying a little but extra for that quality. When i pull out the hose he gave me I curse at it and it makes my life miserable"
5.0,"I bought one of these a year ago, and after a summer's use liked it enough to replace the old length of hose I still had to use to reach anywhere in the backyard. Now with two 75' lengths, life is good. No kinks, solid construction, great fittings."
4.0,good heavy duty hose esp for the money. Glad I bought it. Advertising seems accurate to the model. Works well.
5.0,These are awesome! Cut easily thru even large flower stems and branches.
5.0,nice and sharp!
5.0,"Ah, who doesn't love Fiskars? I became a loyal fan when a pair of loppers I had for 6 years broke and all I did was call and give the lady my barcode number off the handle and I got a replacement in less than a week. They are sharp and prune well. I just like knowing the company backs the product."
5.0,Very happy do a great job
5.0,Love these
3.0,"These slice well, not thrilled with how they 'bounce' or really don't open back up.  I had a different type prior, they seemed to just spring back open for your to cut the next limb. I wouldn't purchase again."
5.0,Good buy
5.0,They prune.
5.0,I have been using these for a couple of years and they work nicely.
5.0,"Now, if I could only get someone to do the pruning............"
4.0,On high speed setting it still moves a little too slow. Well made and like the auto stop.
3.0,"This sprinkler works well and gives great spread and even distribution for watering. Especially on large areas. My only complaint is on the quality. After unboxing this thing and setting it out in my yard it ran for about 2 minutes and both wheels fell off!!! After going out and looking at it it turns out the wheel caps that come with the unit in the box had cracked and completely broken off. See the photo attached. I went to Lowe's and got some 7/16 cap nuts that were much higher quality and got it back up and running. So if you purchase this unit and you have the same problem go find a 7/16 axle cap nut from Lowe's. Home Depot does not carry the right size.

I guess we'll see how long the other parts last."
5.0,"LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!  I had reason reviews on how sturdy and heavy duty it was but I was really surprised at its durability! Nice wide range that it waters. So far, no complaints! Planning on ordering 2 more!"
3.0,This product was okay.  I liked the fact that I can make it go where I needed it to.  It took quite a bit of adjusting to get it where I needed it to be.  One thing that I dislike is that I have bare spots where I had seeded it.  The force from the sprinkler was so high that it basically shot my seeds and the dirt all over the place.  I have decided to keep this one in the garage and possibly sell it to someone else.
5.0,"Always wanted one so we decided to get one, Works just like it should!"
5.0,good price what i wanted
4.0,"Sure beats hand watering!  We have narrow strips of lawn immediately to the east and south of our house that are connected.  Even though there is an automated sprinkler system installed, we get better coverage with this traveling sprinkler.  I water in two settings because the sprinkler isn't pulling the hose straight behind it when going around the corner.  The only issue is that sometime in the bumpy part of our lawn, the sprinkler will turn it self off prematurely because the lawn bumps (clumps) function as the turnoff ramp.  If the wheels were slightly larger in diameter, I believe this wouldn't happen on our lawn.  Love that you can select between two different watering speeds.  Overall we love this sprinkler.  Have used for two seasons and still going."
3.0,High speed is much slower than expected.
5.0,"This is the cast metal one. I have heard of issues with the plastic transmissions, I have had no issues with it dragging up to 200' of hose behind it. Make sure you use a larger diameter hose or the flow will be restricted."
5.0,Love it!
4.0,"These hoses are durable , flexible and kink less than all the other hoses in this price range.  Much better than the cheap Chinese hose at Tractor supply.  These are made in the USA.  They are  a little higher than some other hoses, but perform much better and last longer.  I have replaced all my hoses with Gilmour after testing the others.  Good price on AMAZON!!!"
5.0,This is a great hose that seems to be very sturdy and well made and we bought two.  Nice and flexible and so far there has been no problem with kinking although we have only used the hoses for 7 months.  We keep them on a reel and they wind up neatly.  Amazon's price was certainly the best.  I saw this hose in local stores with a much higher price tag.  They were shipped immediately.  I recommend it.
4.0,"Its durable, but heavy.  I purchased 3 of these for our shore house to sit outside on the docks.  After one season, they still look like new.  They have a nice thread on end, and I expect that they will last for many years.  I coil them up after using and have never kinked or knotted.

The only down side to this hose is the weight.  These puppies are heavy. I drag the hose from the bib down the ramp and onto the boat to rinse the motor, or across the docks to rinse the crab traps or shells off the docks from the birds.  The further you are away, the heavier it gets..."
5.0,"I LOVE Gilmour hoses for 2 reasons. They work do not curl up, work great, and when they don't you get a replacement!"
4.0,"I like this hose a lot, but it is much stiffer than other hoses I have.  Good quality but stiff"
5.0,This is an excellent hose. I am tired of buying hoses at my local hardware store and not lasting a long time. This hose is awesome and I think it will last me more than any other I have ever purchased.
5.0,"Believe it or not I've had one of these hoses for over 30 years!  It sits out on the patio in sun, rain and weather.  I've tried other hoses that looked similar but ended up tossing
them in the garbage in short order- kinks, snarls, etc., even in warm weather.  After 30+ years, though still usable, my hose has a couple pin hole leaks and the outer cover is cracked so I was happy to find the label/warranty from my original so that I knew what
to order."
5.0,"wonderful product.  Doesn't kink very often, and always easy to move.  The brass fittings are always to tolerance - easy to attach anything."
5.0,The best and last hose you will ever need.  These hoses withstand it all (except the lawn mower) does well in any weather condition ends hold up and don't leak overtime or break off like some other cheap hoses on the market today.  I live in the town where these are produced and I know that these hoses are made by hard working everyday Americans so take pride in knowing that these hoses are made right here int he USA!!!
5.0,This hose was less expensive then many others and works just as well as the super heavy duty hoses in the past. I'm not sure yet about durability since it has only been about a month since purchase.  The green color is also quite nice
5.0,My favorite pruners.
5.0,great price and quick ship!
1.0,"Bought this pair of shears since they were a good price and had decent reviews. Busted them out this morning to mince up some apricot branches, since the green waste pickup was coming stat. Within literally 2 minutes the spring mechanism had disengaged, leaving me to manually open the the clippers for every cut. WTF FISKARS. Also, the apricot branches were pretty tough, but these did a pretty crap job at cutting through them as well. Life's too short for crappy pruning shears.

YOLO........RETURNED"
4.0,It cuts but not very easily for small tree branches.  I have to use all my strength. I guess it's better for plants.
5.0,"Love these things!  So much so, I bought a second set after using first pair for 3 yrs with no problems.  Keeps sharp edge to blades too."
5.0,They worked very well.
5.0,These work great to trim the low branches where I walk. I'm very satisfied.
5.0,Work great
4.0,Very nice. Easy to cut stems.
4.0,Good value for pruners.
5.0,Works perfectly!  follows the hose as described and shuts itself off.  It ever travels over my sidewalk.  it does't work well traveling on rocky areas but I can avoid those.
5.0,It's great but my husband still doesn't water enough.
1.0,"This is horrible, I was so excited to get this but I am missing the connector for the wands to connect to the upper tractor. I wish I could give this a 0 rating"
2.0,"very picky about terrain to get it to move.  good idea, but just stops too easily and then you have only one area watered."
2.0,"Arms keep popping off, it gets stuck on the smallest little irregularities in the terrain, and it moves too slowly. When it gets stuck, it will just keep saturating the same area until you stop it. It is really cool when it is moving, but just requires way too much attention. I love trains, so I really wanted to love this sprinkler."
3.0,"UPDATE 4-12-18
HAVE HAD THIS FOR A MONTH AND IT NO LONGER SHUTS OFF ON IT'S OWN, LEAKS, VERY DISAPPOINTED, CONSIDERING WE ONLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH.

It is as described, all metal though so it is heavy when delivered! Have not tried it yet though!"
1.0,"Do not like.  I purchased as I have a fairly large sloped back yard and a fair sized front lawn.  I didn't want to go out every so often to move the sprinkler; I wanted to set and forget it.  Too many variables and things that can stop it from traveling.  Fairly easy to assemble.  I had no luck with the sloped back yard so I tried it on the flat front.  Instructions say if you don't position the arms correctly it may not travel and the position of the arms determine the coverage area..  I guess I didn't figure it out as it didn't move for me and after so many tries I gave up.  back and forth to the faucet till I said forget it.  If I had one thing right, I had inadverently moved something else stopping me from getting it to work.  I ended up with a rotating sprinkler in the back that worked for me, I'll get something similar for the front. I'm not the most astute when it comes to putting things together and sometimes it takes me several tries, but I usually can persevere until I figure it out.  I've done drywall, venting, and replaced all the smoke detectors in my 3-story townhome but this, I just had no luck with."
5.0,"I love this. Quite a bit heavier than the ones that I had for years but it turns out to be a good thing. Very high quality product. Once you get the hang of how to use it, you'll love it. If you have a large area to water, this it the sprinkler for you. I recommend buying the longest hose you can because it will not go over the spot where two hoses are joined together. It will simply trip the shutoff feature when it gets to the joining spot."
3.0,"Looks really Cool, but kept coming off the track and wondering into neighbors yard or falling on its side."
5.0,"Good for yards that aren't perfect squares, rectangles or parallelograms!"
3.0,"This product greatly reduces the time and effort to plant seeds. However, the suggested wheel selections for each seed type isn't correct. For example, I use the wheel for beets to plant beans. I did not use the beet wheel for planting beets as it would deposit way too many seeds (each beet seed is really 4 seeds). The workmanship on the wheels was lacking. There was way too much mold flash so that some slots would not scoop up seeds. The drag chain, that is suppose to close the furrow, is too light and doesn't close it in heavier soils.
This product is in need of further engineering.
I suggest that, before taking this to the garden, test runs with the desired seed and wheel be done to see how that wheel works with the seed and that the seed spacing is as desired.
All in all, this still beats the hoe and rake method of planting"
4.0,"A wonderful tool for the home vegetable gardner. The seed plates that come with the seeder will cover most gardeners' needs, and you can purchase optional seed plates with your planter that should cover most any other application. The only negative I have found is that if you plant in freshly tilled, plowed, loose soil your seeds will wind up being planted much deeper than the setting you choose. A solution would be to lightly pack the soil before planting.  All in all a real handy, well designed, and effective addition to a gardners' arsenal. (and it will save many a backache)"
4.0,"My friend has one of these and I bought it on his suggestion.  It works pretty well.  I have a garden that is over an acre.  77 rows, most of which are 200 ft. long.  If the ground is loose, it is wonderful.  My problem is that a lot of my garden is mostly clay and makes rather large clods.  The seeder is hard to manage over rough dirt, but still easier than sowing by hand.  I consider it to be a time saver and worth the money."
5.0,I have not used this item yet.  I wanted it to make gardening planting easier.  It is too early to plant anything except onions.  But I have owned this type of item before and I loved it.  I simply have not used the one I bought via Amazon yet.
1.0,"I would not recommend this tool or gadget to anyone.  Your soil has to be this finest and even then my plantings were sparse and uneven.  I hand planted several rows at the same time and they came up perfect, so I know it was not the seeds. I planted corn and beans and got the same result with both plantings."
5.0,"Good job guys!

very happy to take delivery of my new garden seeder.

Many thanks

David"
2.0,"I have a fairly big garden, so I decided to make my life a little easier next spring, and thus I bought this seeder.  However, so far, it's not what I thought I would be getting as far as a truly precision planter is concerned.  The seeds dropped irratically and/or popped out of the bin because the plates would bind up then suddenly spring loose.  I used different sized plates trying to find that exact match with the same results.  I contacted the factory by email (their response was very quick) and was told to use bee's wax and soap to make it work correctly.  For the price of the unit, I expected something with less ""after-market engineering"" required by me to make it funtion as advertised.  I refuse to admit defeat, so I'm keeping it and will continue to practice with it until spring.  If it or I don't get better, I know where you can get a used one cheap next summer!"
5.0,"First of all, I'm a gardener from way back.  I helped my mom weed her flowers when I was still in the womb.  I love garden gadgets and all things bliss-enhancing.  When I was a teenager my grandfather bought the first incarnation of the Earthway Precision Garden Seeder and it was love at first shove.  Not only does it plow the furrow, it plants the seeds at a precise depth and covers them up, it also marks the next row for you so that your garden doesn't sprout into a psychadelic homage to 1970's acid waves.  I love, love, love this little jigger!  It clogs from time to time, but if you're watching every perfect little seed get tucked away neatly into it's new earthly bed, you'll catch it before you have to re-plant the entire garden.  What took my father and me 2 hours last year to do by hand, we did in under 15 mintues using this little gem.  An entire garden planted in 15 minutes!  And not only that, but we hand-sowed a 1/4 acre plot of corn in under 25 mintues, stopping to pass off and admire the absolute fantastical spectacle of it all as it was happening.  LOVE this thing!"
4.0,"While this is a good tool on the whole -- and not too  expensive either -- it still isn't for every gardener nor for every purpose in the garden. To remove all doubt, perhaps it should not go without saying that this is not a tool for making hills for melons, squash, or zukes. It will not help you with transplants such as tomatoes, nor will it handle seed potatoes. No, this seeder is for rows of things like beans and corn, and in these cases it shines. I still think, however, that you have to be planting a pretty big garden to make it worth your time to set-up the Earthway seeder, learn to use it, store it, and maintain it.

On the pro side, for instance, I used my new Earthway seeder to plant more than 700 row-feet of popcorn. Wow! The Earthway seeder practically paid for itself that day, since it allowed me to plant the entire plot in less than 45 minutes and with no bending over! I also used it to plant plots of field corn, beans, and beets.

Here are my notes, for what they're worth:

1.) Have freshly tilled, fine, debris-free soil. It is difficult to push the seeder through crusted soil or anything with too many lumps in it, and you won't get those perfectly straight rows if you're struggling just to move forward. Also, too much surface trash will be a problem for the little chain that drags behind and covers the seed. Hint: do ""dry runs"" with the seeder at the proper depth, but without seed in the bin. This will give you a sense of how well it's going to work before you commit your seed, and it helps to mark your rows in advance too.

2.) Have enough seed, and watch the seed plate closely as it turns. If the seed bin gets low, the pockets in the seed plates will often fail to scoop up the seeds in a regular fashion. You'll end up with a lot of skips. Of course, if you're not buying your seed at least  pound at a time, I'm not sure why you'd want this tool anyhow.

3.) Select your seed plate carefully, and if needed test it with the seed before use. (Attach a plastic bag under the seeder or something.) For example, I had a limited quantity of small soup beans. I popped in the bean plate and made two rows. Before the end of the second row, however, I was out of seed, which should not have been the case. I didn't figure this out till after the seeds sprouted: that seed plate scooped up those small beans two at a time and double-planted the first row, leaving insufficient seed for the second row.

4.) If you are considering the Fert-A-Ply attachment for the seeder, re-think that. I did not realize till the attachment arrived that I could not use it at the same time as I planted -- meaning that it took re-configuring the seeder and another full set of passes to apply an amendment to my rows. Also, the construction and the few moving parts of the attachment are extremely chintzy. I could not get mine adjusted well and used quite a bit more expensive material than I intended.

5.) The assumption for the Earthway seeder is that your seed is dry. If you like to soak your seeds before planting, or if you want to wet-innoculate things like green beans before planting, I don't think this is the tool for those cases.

6.) I have not tried the seeder with pelleted seeds of any kind, but I bet it would work well for that. Again, pick your seed plate carefully.

7.) Of course, straight rows are an advantage for mechanized cultivation equipment in your garden or even for zipping through the rows with a wheel hoe or high-wheel cultivator. Even if you're not obsessive about straight rows, however, this seeder still can be a time- and back-saver.

I hope this helps you to make a more informed choice."
4.0,"I'm extremely pleased with this product. 10 minutes to assemble - handlebar to machine, put on a wheel, and put on the marker.

The difference between walking upright in the garden, spacing seeds in a logical way vs. the sprinkle while stooped over and knowing they will need to be thinned and there will be gaps.

This thing even puts them at the depth you set and covers them for you. It took less than a 1\4 of the time I'm used to and my back didn't hurt afterward."
5.0,"This is the best hose I've ever used.  It never kinks on me, and the couplings at the ends seem of higher quality than other hoses I've had in the past.  Not much more you can say."
3.0,"Plus...quality of thehose and lifetime warranty

Minus...it kinks easily which stops the water flow until you go back and unbend the kink."
5.0,"We bought ""Always Kink"" last go around. Never again, a total wast of money. This brand Gilmour, will be the hose to buy from now on."
2.0,"I was excited to buy this hose because I wanted a lifetime hose-- and this may still be it, problem is it kinks at every twist. It took me 20 minutes to get it unkinked and from my water sprout stretched to my pool. Very frustrating and hard to manage."
2.0,"This hose was a real disappointment.  It's described as flexible; it's about as flexible as a lead pipe.  No way can I curl it up or, for that matter, really uncurl it.  Beware!"
3.0,Perhaps I was expecting too much but the hose does crimp if you aren't careful. We'll see how long it lasts and if that is as promised. I was expecting more but it is a pretty good product.
5.0,"I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me"
5.0,"This hose so far is the best one I've bought due to its construction and excellent warranty. I also own Craftsman NeverKink hose with lifetime warranty and this one blows it away.  In fact Sears should call that hose AlwaysKink because that's what it does.  That and I've had to exchange the Craftsman hose 4 times already.  I have not had a problem with this Flexogen hose kinking.  Also it is not too stiff to where it's difficult to handle when filled with pressurized water.  Had this Flexogen hose for around 5 yrs before one of the couplings started leaking. This was totally my fault too when one time I yanked a little too hard on the hose (luckily not damaging the spigot in the process). Contacted Gilmour and their automated phone system gave detailed instructions on how to receive a replacement. NOTE: the address is NOT the MO address being mentioned. It is in IL. After verifying the address with a live rep and $3 shipping, in 1 wk I received a brand new 100' hose! Those nice folks over at Gilmour done upgraded me! Couldn't be happier with a company right now."
5.0,I have two of these hoses and they are a gardener's delight.  I wouldn't have any other hose.  They are flexible and powerful.
5.0,Good hose at a good price. Works well with the Suncast Swivel Hose Hideaway with Smart Trak Hose Guide that I purchased at the same time.
5.0,2 years and still works perfectly.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"I bought this 5 years ago. At my old house I could water the entire back yard with it. My yard was small and in a L shape. I had cheap 5/8 hoses connected to it and it worked perfectly. It would get stuck in the dirt spots of my yard when the yard was new but I learned to make it trac on grass only. I had zoisia grass and cut it short and it worked perfectly. I loved how I could adjust the spray width easily. It was so easy to use I bought another for my front yard. It worked great also!

I now use this at my new house. I somehow lost one sprinkler in our move. Im not sure how. I cant find it. The one I still have is 5 years old and works like new. I can water my back yard super easily. I have two 100 3/4 hoses that I use. I don't water my entire back yard but the 60 x 100 spot that I do water is super easy. I set the hose in its spot. Put the sprinkler at the end. Set the stopping thing near the faucet and let it run. It takes about 7 hours to do my back yard spot on slow setting. I haven't tried fast. My front yard one side then had a 100 3/4 hose and i set it out and put the sprinkler on the end and it waters one entire side. Takes about 3.5 hours on slow. I do the same on the other side of my yard. My yard here I cut to 1 and its Bermuda grass. It has never gotten off track and has worked flawlessly.

I water my yard once per week with this thing in the hot summer of south Texas. Keeps my grass doing well. On low it waters about 3/4 water but that depends on how wide you spray. My spray pattern is about 40 ft wide.

It does water less at the start spot due to starting there and not overlapping but thats the only way it can be done. Hasnt been an issue at my yard though. Just a little dryer where it starts. Im not picky due to this thing making it so easy to water my lawn.

I will be buying two more this spring so I don't have to move it to my front yard spots. Much less expensive than in ground sprinkler system and works great. In ground would be a dream but for my yard I was quoted $7k. I think this is as close to a sprinkler system as you could come and it will cost me $350 for 4 3/4 100 ft hoses and 3 of these sprinklers. Im ok with the very little work this sprinkler requires:)

Highly recommend.

Also...after I used this in my front yard this summer I noticed 4 other neighbors bought them for their yards in our subdivision:)"
3.0,Only can this be used on yards that have grass growing.  Otherwise gets stuff in mud.
2.0,"Man this thing could have been so cool, until it wasnt. I wanted to find an alternative t watering my lawn beyond installing sprinklers or watering by hand. This thing I thought was a brilliant idea. But there were countless Times The unit would fall of the track or remain stuck until I noticed it t was floodIng my yard. Unfortunately my mission to find a watering tool is incomplete"
5.0,Packaging is perfect and this thing works great. Works best in straight away parts of yard; can make turns but they have to be kind of wide turns. Have been using this for several summers and still works great! Have NOT used the auto stop part include so cant verify how well that works.
5.0,Nice heavy duty sprinkler. Love it!
4.0,Works great
5.0,works great
4.0,Takes time to set up but works great even on hills. People like to stop and watch it.
1.0,The handle broke within the 1st 30 minutes of use
5.0,great handles for replacement of my shovels.  Thanks
4.0,"The end that inserts into the shovel was very warped and required the use of a spoke shave to reshape a sharp curve in the end of it and make it useable, but once taken care of, the handle worked well."
4.0,"Good value for the money.  It takes a bit of fitting, but that's to be expected.  I found it just a tad fat for the shovel I was repairing."
5.0,looked in all hardware stores around here and couldn't find this handle.ordered it and it worked great.can use my shovel again and don't have to throw away.would recommend handle to anyone looking for a replacement d handle.
5.0,I was ready to throw away my fathers shovel after breaking the handle but looked at Amazon and found this handle and with a little bit of sanding got a perfect fit.  Kept some history in the family for a very small expense.
5.0,I got this for one of those long skinny shovels. The wooden handle rotted and snapped but the steel shovel blade was still good. I ordered this and while it was in transit quickly cleaned and spray painted the original blade. This handle fit perfectly and the whole shove is good as new.
5.0,This handle is exactly what I had been looking for.  It is exactly what I thought I was ordering and not a cheap imitation.  It came quickly in the mail and it fit the shovel exactly.
5.0,"Had to bench grind it (a lot to fit my particular shovel well. When it got to where it seated as I liked it then I drilled the pin and set it. Very solid, stable. I am very happy with it. Have a new shovel for about 1/3 the cost of a new one."
5.0,Nice grip and easy squeeze.
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"Fiskars has an outstanding reputation for quality tools.
I saw a couple of pruning shears, but when I came upon Fiskars, I bought it. Price was very reasonable. It came in excellent packaging. The shears are very sharp and smooth, easy to use. I love them."
5.0,"Wow, I am not surprised. These Fiskars Traditional Bypass Pruning Shears have  2,090 customer reviews with a 4.4 star rating for a reason. They are fantastic. Being over the age of 30 I am always a bit suspicious when I read ""Life-time warranty"" and ""Hardened blade stays sharp."" Have heard it before and it's not always true. These pruning shears stay sharp.

I have just used them every day for two weeks and used them - a lot. In the woods behind my house grow trees which drop an enormous amount of seed that sprout into new trees. Can't have that many young trees. Hence I worked my way through the lot cutting hundreds of young baby trees, one, two, maybe even three yrs old. The pruning shears stayed sharp.
This seals the deal for me. They are fantastic.
5 stars,
Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger"
1.0,At first these were great. But after a summer of light gardening these have become a major pain to use. Everytime I made a cut they would lock up and I have kept them clean. I wasn't cutting anything thicker than rose or azalea bush. These have been thrown into the junk pile. Youd have better luck with plain old scissors.
5.0,"These are pretty great! I used them to cut limbs from a cherry tree and a few other bushes, had no trouble cutting limbs as thick as my thumb. Get em!"
4.0,Easy to grip and cuts my small garden plants effortlessly!  Nice and priced well.
5.0,Sharp and powerful
1.0,Very disappointed in this shear. Can barely cut anything! The metal on the cutters starting to peel back after just a couple of uses and I threw it away. Don't waste your money on this item.
4.0,"I bought these Pruning shears on a whim due to the very low price (sub $10 I believe.) I must say that I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the product. I've owned a few Fiskars products for various jobs. This is good stuff in my book. I don't use these shears around the house, I use them for cutting paths through thick brush on the way to the stream or the river. They'll do fine for that. I don't plan on cutting anything too massive with them. I also like the fairly compact size of them. They'll fit quite nicely in an inner pocket I rigged up in my Fishing Vest. I only wish they had a hole drilled into one of the handles so I could attach a piece of paracord to it in case it would pop out of my pocket. Oh well, I'll modify them myself."
5.0,"I am very happy with this hose.  I had purchased a hose at my local HD that was advertised as ""Never-Kink"" and it kinked more than any hose I've ever owned.  This Gilmore hose is great- it's not too heavy and is very kink resistant.  You will not be disappointed."
5.0,"I got rid of a 50 year old garden hose ,This will last for thr rest of my life. BOB PICCIANO"
4.0,Great hose. Does not kink which was a buying priority! Hate kinky hoses. Great reasonable price for a 100' hose.
2.0,"After three years of using two of these Gilmour hoses and four Craftsman hoses the clear winner without a doubt is the Craftsman. Three fittings have started leaking on the Gilmour hoses and the Craftsman hoses have had no problems. I have a cheap hose that is still working without leaks that is much older than the Gilmour Flexogen hose and 1/4 the price. The hose itself seems high quality, the problem is in the fittings, and not the replaceable rubber gasket either but the part that swivels. I am very disappointed and will buy Craftsman hoses from now on. I don't recommend this hose."
1.0,"This hose split and couldn't be repaired.  It was a total piece of junk.

Don't waste your money.  I love the concept of this type of hose as it is light and easy to use.  Just don't buy this one."
3.0,I thought the hose would  be more flexible and less heavy than it was--seems strong . Time will tell us.
5.0,I must have tried 30 types of hoses and this flexogen may be the last one I will ever purchase..It is true..no kinks..
5.0,Really good hose for the price. It fells like it is going to be hard to handle but it is not. And I have yet to get it to tangle or kink.
5.0,"High quality, fast delivery, and best price for an 8-ply 5/8 by 100 ft. I compared it with local big box stores,etc."
5.0,"If you want to know what hoses to get, ask a gardener. They will say Gilmour. I just wish I had done this earlier in my life. If it ever is a problem, just cut off the two ends and they will send you a new one."
5.0,"I was so nervous to spend that kind of money on a sprinkler but kept looking at it and wondering how well it worked. I seem to buy cheap new sprinklers every year anyway which adds up, so I was looking for something more durable. I didn't want to spend the money and have it not hold up or work well... then a new neighbor moved in behind me and had one! So lucky, I'd never seen one before so it was an awesome coincidence!!! He said he has owned it for almost 10 years like other reviews I read, and he loved it! So I bought it. I love it! So much easier to set it up for one swoop across my back yard. If I buy a longer hose I may shorten the spray width and have it go in a ""U"" shape and then down the side yard too, but right now at least I can cover my back yard with it as compared to moving my sprinkler around 3-4 times. I then shorten the width and go down the side and front. Also tempting to buy a second one to use for that and have both going at the same time (because your hose can only be so long so you will likely move it around some). I used it one full summer and so far so good. It looks cool too."
5.0,"Exactly like the original from the old days.  Assembles in minutes, and works like a charm.  I am running over 100' of hose up and down some fairly stout hills, and she's only tipped (sidehilling) one time; and that was my fault for pushing the boundaries during the initial test phase.  For most yards, this sprinkler would be absolutely fine."
1.0,Sprinkler works good while the transmission lasts. We have a large yard and run 2 a lot with our dry years. Lucky if transmissions last about a year so no more money spent on these. Tired of buying complete transmissions for them when normally only 2 gears wear out. Plastic is not good enough for prolonged use. Average use probably ok.
5.0,"I have a couple smaller animal pastures, mainly sheep and goats.  California is in another drought and no rain this December!  My pasture has a few gopher holes this sprinkler must avoid, but it works great!!  It may seem expensive, but it beats installing a sprinkler system!

The only question I have is why didn't I purchase this earlier??!!"
5.0,Works great
5.0,Best thing ever. Very reliable.
5.0,Works great and we are able to water the entire yard.  Very solid unit.  This is my second one. My first one lasted close to 40 years.  Highly recommend this sprinkler.
5.0,This thing is the best sprinkler I have tried yet!  Just set you hose where you want the sprinkler to travel and turn on the water.  This made it a breeze to water the long stretch of my front yard.  You can easily adjust the angle of the tubes to change the spread of the water as well.
5.0,"Shouldve bought this thing a long time ago, but I was hesitant because of the price. But after having to move our old sprinkler around several times each evening & still not covering everything...I finally ordered it & its been an awesome investment so far. Just read the manual & follow the directions "
5.0,"Travels as far as you have hose, then turns it self off, used one as a kid, also most as good as a in ground/"
3.0,"This is ok for super small projects, but they don't work on the more established plants."
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,Best gardening shears I've found
5.0,TO just received the Bypass pruning shears. I used them.  Today I would Recommend to Family and friend! Thanks
5.0,"Very smooth operation, cuts very well through branches as well. Comfortable in the hand."
5.0,Purchased for my father. He loves them!
5.0,The product was delivered promptly and arrived as described.
5.0,Very smooth a powerful tool !!
5.0,"Super awesome and sharp, it has a well designed joint."
5.0,Work great for small bushes.
4.0,"Great for long/big back yards, slightly annoying to set up, I take it down and set it up each day so my grass doesnt burn."
4.0,"I like this tractor, have used it three times now. The only problem that i have encountered has been that the tractor is unstable going downhill and can easily tip over into one side.  The auto shut off bracket works great."
5.0,Worked just like I remember grandmas. Quality construction.
5.0,Love that I don't have to move the sprinkler it dose it on it's own.
5.0,works great
5.0,"Love this for watering on long days. I don't have to go out and move the sprinkler, it's well worth the price."
1.0,"Never could get this thing to ""travel."" And the huge distance that it throws the water (no matter how much you futz with adjusting the arms) makes it useless if you're trying to water a limited area."
5.0,I have used multiple sprinklers and this is by far my favorite! Just set up your path and it does the rest. Great for those of us who forget to move the hose when watering.
5.0,"Have had experience with walking sprinklers and this is a good one.  Operates as advertised but just don't expect it to pull a long, heavy hose."
4.0,Works well if their is existing turf.  Gets stuck and falls over in exposed topsoil
5.0,"This hose is great: Flexible, very durable and stands up well to New Mexico sun. It is also something our new puppy chose as her go-to chew toy, so I am buying another. Before she had gnawed the first one down to a 15-foot stump of a hose, I had the chance to repair it (several times), and you can see the multi-ply construction when you cut the hose... This is obvious why it lasts so well (dogs excepted). Cutting the hose to make a clean spot for the repair even takes a little effort with garden shears: It has really strong walls with fiber reinforcement, but remains flexible and easy to use.

So time to buy another, and keep the hose cart outside the yard when not in use.

Munch munch."
5.0,Very good hose for my wife and I to handle since we're both in our eighties and the other hoses are too darn heavy to tug around
5.0,Worth the price for sure. Bought it to use with my pressure washer and the kink free part works well.
3.0,"A heavy pull at 75' thru grass. Works well on hose rell.  A good buy with a great warranty. Gilmour product are
always a  good buy."
4.0,purchased this item due to reviews by individuals that bought it and several different websites that sell this produce.  no more leaks or having 2 or 3 hoses hooked together which was a problem. not any more with the 100 footer.  brass fittings are great  moves easily and don't worry about the hose bending or twisting causing the water flow to stop.  great buy great price.
1.0,"The hose works. As long as you don't kink it. The kink-resistance is non-existent in practice with a hose this long. To make things worse, after 2 months of use, the hose developed a leak right at the ""Flow Guard Plus"" collar, so now it's not usable at all. It didn't work well as a kink-resistant hose, and now it doesn't work at all as a hose."
1.0,"It's been sitting in my garage and I'm scared to touch it!  The packaging has a warning stating that there are hazardous chemicals known to cause cancer in or on the hose, and to take precautions and wash your hands after using.  I don't want to touch it to begin with, especially having children around who are always putting their hands in their mouths.

I wish I would have known about this before purchasing, that's why I'm writing a review, so that others can make an informed decision.

Pros: Looks like it is well made, and I like the color
Cons: Contains hazardous chemicals known to cause cancer"
5.0,I've owned this for years and it still is not kinking. I'm very impressed as all the other hoses I've owned have all had kinks after a few months.
4.0,I like this hose very much and doesn't kink as advertised.  I use this one for my front yard and will get one for the back yard.  I would recommend this hose to my family and friends.
5.0,"This is a very good garden hose.  This was a replacement for a supposed ""heavy duty"" hose I bought from a well-known big-box store that just didn't hold up.  That hose leaked and sprayed all over the place from the minute I brought it home and already started to kink and pinhole within a month.  This Gilmour hose doesn't leak a drop and hasn't kinked on me at all.  I'm pretty happy with this product and will look to buying all Gilmour hoses for my future needs."
3.0,It seems to be a high quality product and well made.  But the the bottom didn't have nearly the curve needed to fit my scoop shovel.  So I had to use my bench sander and grind off quite a bit of material to make it work.
5.0,"Helped me bring an old scoop shovel back to life.  Took two of us to complete the install, but to be fair, neither of us had replaced a handle in a few years."
5.0,My favorite shovel I use almost daily around my place finally broke in two. So started looking around for a replacement handle vs throwing this out and buying a whole new shovel. Couldn't find the shorter D-handle anywhere local so of course went on to Amazon and found several choices. Prices seem to vary from $15- $40 and without being to handle and see what each one looks like I had no idea what was the best choice. This one was one of the best priced handles so just went with that. Turns out to be a really nice USA-Made handle. Stamped steel D handle end is SOLID and heavier than the original one. Has a wood handle grip on the end. Installed easy and used it all day today and very happy with it so far. Thankful to have my favorite shovel back in service. Glad I didn't get one of the more expensive versions because I can't imagine them being much better than this one. Will update review if I have any issues with use.
4.0,It'll work ok but I think I should have ordered a different one.
5.0,I have had this sweet little shovel for years and was so happy to find a new handle
5.0,"I used this to fix a heavy duty old square edged spade shovel with a broken handle.
It fit perfectly!  Has just the right curve at the shovel end and the shoulder was in exactly the right place.
First I drilled and pushed out the old rivet, then removed the fragment of the old handle.
Then inserted the new handle, tapped it in  and drilled a hole for the rivet.  Rivet was included,
and was easy to peen over with a ball peen hammer.
I think the whole operation took about 15 mins.
Now I have a rugged shovel instead of buying a flimsy new one."
5.0,"Had a #2 scoop shovel that was probably at least 50 to 60 years old yet in good shape except the need of a handle. This handle was a perfect fit, has a good feel and look and holding it brings back memories of when I used it helping my dad unload 5 or 6 ton of coal by hand from a flat bed truck with sideboards while growing up. Love the hand grip at the end."
5.0,fixed my shovel for 1/4 the price of a new shovel. Easy to install too!
4.0,It worked well.
4.0,No problem good product
4.0,"In theory this is a great product. My parents had something similar years ago and I remember it working well. However, things were made much better years ago. My home has poor water pressure and this thing barely moves. I'm attributing the poor performance to the low water pressure; however, not being able to see it with good water pressure, I can't say for sure."
2.0,"It works as explained but not a great product for areas where you don't have thick grass. In other words, if you have young grass or dirt soil where grass yet to grown it will not move and it gets stuck."
2.0,I don't like the auto shut off
5.0,The Nelson Raintrain traveling sprinkler is the best sprinkling units Ive ever purchased. It is so easy to attach to hose and then set the areas you need watering. I use mine with a timer and it reaches most my entire front lawn. The two wings that project the water spreads it out very far. The lawn gets an even water pattern. I  Highly recommend this product.
5.0,This one works well
5.0,Works great! Once you get the hose path set you just turn on the faucet and let it go. It saves me so much time since Im not moving the sprinkler every 15-20 minutes. Used it 10-15 times and no problems. Ill update if issues arise.
5.0,the sprinkler is awesome I watered my new back yard with one sprinkler
5.0,"THIS is the sprinkler to get! It is the next best thing behind actually having a automatic sprinkler system! for lazy people that don't want to move a sprinkler around the yard every 45 minutes this is the one! I don't think I can say anymore other than people complaining about it spinning its wheels in mud, etc...they just need to accept the fact that it is not perfect..but it is next to perfect. sometimes you have to accept the good with the bad!"
5.0,I really like this sprinkler. Trying to keep up with the neighbors who have sprinkler systems!! 
5.0,"I ordered this 9 years ago.  When not in use, I drain the water out of it and leave it outdoors.  It still works perfectly.  About the only thing it cannot do is work in mud.  Mud is what you get if you water bare dirt with no grass on it - once I got some grass growing (9 years ago), it worked fine.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  I loan it out to neighbors from time to time."
1.0,"I bought this based on name recognition and my perception of the reputation of Fiskars. However, this is not a good product. To make a cut, the moveable blade passes past a non-movable shearing plate. This non-moveable plate piece is soft; it can be bent by hand using pliers without much effort. I used this product on a 3/8-inch diameter green birch branch and the shear-plate was bent, nicking the moveable blade in the process, making the shears unusable without repair. I had to bend the non-movable shear-piece back in alignment and file the blade to be able to continue using the shears. I would not recommend this product to others. It is far too fragile for real-world situations."
5.0,Best shears i can find. I use on fruit bushes and rose bushes and they are great. Great locking feature for safety.
5.0,"handy super item, only thing is the hand grips are sliding off the metal sleeve of the pruning shears, and it started within the very hour I used them and they still do it.  Overall though its a great product."
5.0,"If you need a durable, sharp gardening scissors to trim and remove small branches then look no further. This is a quality made equipment. It's very sharp and it really simplified my task of removing some over grown tree  branches in my backyard."
1.0,"I bought these on July 31, 2017 and got them a few days later.  There doesn't seem to be any kind of spring in them so in order to use them I have to manually open them, put them around the branch, squeeze the handles and then manually open them again.  That doesn't make sense!  The attached picture shows how far they open on their own.  Also, the locking mechanism broke.  I had to buy a new pair at Lowe's today."
5.0,Lovely shears for cutting the branches
4.0,"Getting used to the locking button, but otherwise nice and sharp and easy to handle."
5.0,Well constructed. Sharp cutting edges. Excellent tool.
5.0,works well. does what it is designed to do...and is very inexpensive. Basic pruning shears...nothing more nothing less
5.0,Great.
2.0,"The Nelson from 1965 used steel gears and wheels. This product uses a plastic drive train and wheels, and plastic parts in the sprinkler mechanism. The truly original walking sprinkler was designed in 1937 and is still manufactured in the US today by the National Walking Sprinkler Company. The National is more expensive ($180 for their most durable version) but every single part of the drive train is steel, the wheels are steel, and the sprinkler mechanism is brass with brass nozzles. There is not a single plastic part and the sprinkler is designed to last for decades. All you need do is oil the moving parts, store the sprinkler in the garage during the winter, and you will never need to purchase a replacement. In the long run, the National is a far better value. I am an owner of the National Walking Sprinkler and am not in any way compensated for this review. I am simply a consumer who is tired of the poorly constructed consumer products sold in this era of plastic, wear dated mechansizms."
5.0,present for christmas not used yet but did like the price.
4.0,"The sprinkler is great when it works, but it has some room for improvement.  I would've given it 2 stars but the company is encouraging so I gave them a 4-star rating.  I had this product for less than two years before one gear stripped off and it stopped moving forward.  The gears are made of plastic so they chip easily.  I wrote the company and they quickly send a new gear set.  I was incredibly surprised and thankful for the new gear set so I made sure I completed a review.  I don't do a whole lot of reviews unless they are more positive in nature and the company deserves an honorable mention.  Thank you for the replacement gear set Nelson!"
5.0,"I am an unbiased reviewer of the Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler. It does not always travel via the hose pathway, but that may be due to the terrain of the yard more than the sprinkler itself.  Its heavy duty.  I suspect the plastic parts may give out before the body does.  We'll see."
4.0,Our yard is too small. 
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPRINKLER!!!! It is very mesmerizing to watch!! We are buying a second one for the front yard. The one thing you have to watch is that if you have too big of a hose (i.e. heavy) and your grass is thick, the weight of the hose has a slight tendency to pull down on the back wheels slightly more than usual and the front guide wheel will come off of the hose and not follow the route of the hose. Our solution is to use a smaller diameter (i.e. light) hose. Like I said, we LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPRINKLER!!!!"
5.0,Great product for large yard my last one lasted 25 years!
5.0,I love this so much I have 3.
5.0,"Well made novel item that delivers! Great adjustability of speed and coverage! By controlling water flow rate and changing the angle of the wands you can drench small or large areas at various speeds. My 100ft x 100ft lawn is sloped significantly in places but is no problem for this amazing device! It follows the hose flawlessly and the shut-off feature works good as long as the block is on a relatively straight portion of the hose. I love to watch this thing work! (Yes, I need a life!)"
5.0,"This sprinkler saves time. No more looking at your watch every 20 minutes to move the water. It's heavy but that is needed for what it does. Thinking of adding decal racing stripes, numbers and flames."
5.0,"bought this hose to replace one i hated. so far so good the hose has stood up to some dragging and pulling and has not sprung a leak.  it has not kinked on me yet.  I try to keep it from coiling and twisting when i use it and it's been perfect.  i suspect the extra ""plys"" help keep it relatively rigid."
1.0,"This is the worst hose I've ever used, ever! I bought this in a 25' length to use on
our backyard faucet. In spite of the guarantee to never kink, it started kinking as
soon as I set it up. Today, while trying to unkink it yet again, it broke my
Claber hose connector. I will be sticking with my Apex hoses from now on. I've used
them for years, hooking four or five together for watering our trees and have never
had issues with kinks.

I would give this product no stars if I could."
5.0,I have no complaints with this hose. It's well built and so far I've had no kinks which is why I bought it in the first place.
5.0,"rec'd hose in good condition, well pck.
hose is  awell made product, would reccommend  to anyone looking  for a long term usage"
1.0,"I bought this hose on August 4th 2013. It was fine for 2 weeks then I left it laying in the sun for several hours, and couldn't believe that it had bulged through in several spots and one spot was spraying water out.. I will attempt to return this. Never saw any hose do this before"
5.0,"These guys make a great product.
Durable & quality are 2 words that come to mind when I think flexogen."
4.0,Very nice sturdy hose.  Flexible enough to roll up well.  Not a lot more you can say about a hose except that it gets the water where you want it without you getting all wet.
5.0,Never kinks and never leaks.  Great hose.  I own multiples of these in different lengths.  Best hoses I have owned.
5.0,We own two of these hoses in different lengths.  Both have served us well and have never leaked or kinked on us.
4.0,Holds up great for the price.  Does kink though.  Not a huge deal.  I would recommend a holder for it.
1.0,My cordless quite today and it doesnt work. What can I do
5.0,Very nice tool
5.0,"Fiskar is an industry leader in outdoor equipment, I'm glad I found these before buying something else. Would buy again if needed, recommend to everyone. Solid handles, solid blades, works great. Great product, great price."
1.0,"How can these be a number 1 Best Seller?
I am extremely disappointed in this item. Since they are a Fiskars product sold by Fiskars I am also very disappointed in the company.
I was using them for the first time and found that I couldn't cut a branch of 1/4"" without the cutters getting hung up. I even had a few such incidents cutting a 1/8"" twig. The cutting blade would bypass the branch being cut and leave a gap on the tool that you could see through.
OK what should I have expected for $10.00? I was hoping for something that would last, at least, for the rest of this year and it's now September 25th. No such luck. I'll be replacing them tomorrow."
5.0,Great
1.0,"Terrible! The blade dulls quite quickly, does not cut through cleanly is poorly built. Spend the extra money to buy a quality product, as you will be disappointed after 3 months of use."
2.0,"These worked very well for about 5 minutes of light pruning before they became dull and pitted.
Don't both buying these for anything remotely hard."
5.0,Shears work great and arrived on time as promised.
5.0,Great
5.0,"We had a very tall Lucky Bamboo plant that we needed to trim - propagate the shoots and cut back the main stalk to encourage new growth.  I was nervous using regular scissors or a knife since bamboo is thick and I didn't want to damage them.  These pruning shears worked wonderfully - minimal pressure, very crisp/clean cut.  I like that they have a lock on them to keep them closed when not in use to minimize possible cuts/accidents."
5.0,"Love it, but had to buy a second because of the size of yard."
5.0,"The Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler has been very efficient and convenient in watering our large yard.  The yard is about half an acre and previously I would have to set up multiple sprinklers and move them several time to water the lawn in this very dry summer.  Now I set it up once, turn it on, and the whole yard is watered while I am free to do other things,  I did have to purchase an additional hose to cover the whole yard and I was concerned that it would hang up on the connection point but it passed right over it.  It has 2 speeds,  On the slow speed it takes about 5 hours to water the whole yard.  My only regret is that I didn't listen to my husband when he suggested buying one years ago."
5.0,"My dad bought one of these for me 15 to 18 years ago and I love it. It still works great, but my lawn is 5 acres and I decided two would be nice. The new one works exactly like the one I already have. They are awesome, plug the water hose into it, turn the water on and let it go. It will give your lawn a slow soaking watering as if it drizzled rain on it all day. Great Product!"
1.0,This product did not work at all for us. It keeps getting stuck in the mud. Our property is extremely flat so there should be no issue for it to move. Extremely disappointing! Customer service was also terrible and we were charged 15% to ship back even though it is promoted as being on prime.
5.0,Heavy duty cast iron
5.0,had one before
5.0,Great Sprinkler travels great
5.0,"I Love it, just lay out the hose and forget it"
5.0,This is really a very neat traveling Sprinkler. I have used it and it is the best.
1.0,"Didn't work and I sent it back. Arms wouldn't rotate and wheels wouldn't move. It was certainly heavy enough that it gave the initial impression that it would be a good little workhorse. But unless there is something really tricky in getting it going (yes, I found the button on the bottom) there was nothing I could do to make any of it work. Just sat their and directed water to one spot."
5.0,This is a very well built replacement handle. It should last for years. The packing and shipping were outstanding. Strongly recommended.
1.0,I took my time. I have all of the necessary tools. I think the expansion slot was too big. I drilled the hole for the rivet pin . During the process of setting the pin the handle cracked and then broke the first time I tried to use it . A total loss of $ 17.19 and my time.
5.0,Just fine thanks.
5.0,I needed this bad. So I ordered it. :-)
4.0,"The wood handles on my 2 shovels broke around the same time. I went to both big box stores and 2 local hardware stores and no one carried the smaller hand piece with the handle. I ordered them and received them in  week. Installed both. cheaper than buying new, cheap shovels!
Seems like good quality."
5.0,"Good quality handle. If you have a good old shovel that just needs a handle, this will restore it. It's hard to find a good quality shovel today."
5.0,Worked perfect and fit on the spade head without modification. This handle has been with us as we drive down the pan american highway and has been used countless times without fail.
4.0,Great product
5.0,Perfect item that I was looking for.
5.0,Replaced the old handle with no problems.  Fit snug.  The wood looks good and solid.
5.0,"I purchased this hose because the $10 value hose I bought at HomeDepot burst within one day of use. The fist day I used it, I accidentally left the water turned on over night, and the hose ripped open from the pressure and flooded my yard for a few hours. This hose is tough and does a good job. It doesn't kink and reels up well on my hose crank. It was worth the extra money. I have left the hose on over night by accident a few times, and nothing has happened. No, leaks, bumps or protrusions. I would highly recommend this hose."
5.0,"This hose has been in for years.  I am ahead of my PRV so this sees street pressure, rather than house pressure.  I just purchased shorter lengths of this hose."
5.0,"I researched  every hose before I purchased this one.  I have been very happy with it.

Pros  It does not kink up and is very sturdy

Cons"
3.0,"I ordered this because it's US made and I was looking for a hose that is lightweight and well-made.
Hose is good quality, but not as lightweight as promised."
5.0,"This is a sturdy, well made hose that should meet or exceed any residential need and last a very long time."
5.0,"I am so glad I got this hose.  I checked all places in town and nobody came close to price or equal value.

Lookout as it has REAL brass couplings instead of the brass painted aluminum couplings on almost all other hoses.  The weight of the hose is not overly heavy considering the quality is so good.  I was surprised that it was as light as it was!

My wife loves it too as she can pull it around the yard without kinks forming every three feet.

If I needed one I'd get another.

Happily Hosed"
3.0,"It's a good hose, as advertised, and seems like it will hold up. But I've been using it for a couple of months and the water coming through it is sudsy and smells like the chemical fertilizer you put on your lawn.  I have no interest in watering my vegetable garden or filling the animals' water bowls with water coming through this hose, and I don't really water the lawn (I'm borderline organic around my yard - very few pesticides or herbicides have  been used over the past several years), so now I'm stuck with a hose that, for the most part, is used to water the flower beds and ornamentals, and for washing stuff.  I had thought that regular use would purge residue from manufacturing, and maybe I'm impatient, but it doesn't seem to be getting much better."
5.0,"This is the best hose I have ever used! It is sturdy, does not kink, and is easy to maneuver. Hose connections and nozzles work well with it too. This hose is well constructed using high quality materials."
5.0,"Some things you just HAVE to buy the best. After two of those pocket hoses, as seen on tv, broke in the same week, I decided enough was enough. This is a quality product that will not burst and comes with brass end fittings. You cannot do better for the money."
5.0,"I have bought many hoses over the years. I really like this one. It really resists kinking. And a lifetime warranty,wow. It feels like a quality hose."
5.0,"I AM SO PLEASED!!! Bought this for my husband.  We have LOW water pressure that more than 1 sprinkler or if someone is using water in the  house, we can't water grass, garden, etc.  I bought this and surprised him and he tried it and IT WORKS GREAT!!! We have a small yard, but he lays out the hose as directed and the train does it's job!"
3.0,"The idea is great, Easy to assemble. Execution is just okay. My thought was that I could set it and forget it. Not so for my yard that has some bumps and inclines. I found myself needing to check the status of forward movement routinely. A couple of times it got stuck and continued to put out water which cause a major puddle. About three times one of the metal pipes that delivers the water simply fell off. They are easy to reattach but still prevents you from simply leaving it to do its thing. For the money, I expected a better execution."
2.0,Product is fine but it was supposed to come with the automatic shut off ramp and didn't.
5.0,Recommend this product
5.0,This sprinkler is so much fun to see crawling across the yard.
5.0,"Why didn't we get one of these sooner?? It works great. We have a bit of an incline in the front of our house and I wasn't sure it could climb it, but there does not seem to be a problem."
2.0,"I own two and neither is satisfactory. Both have a design flaw that all of these have. Nelson uses plastic gears for the propulsion and are prone to wearing out very quickly and are inherently weak and not able to pull much hose. Really no more than 20 feet without starting to strip, which causes the unit to stop moving forward. Nelson will gladly sell you new gears every couple of years for $35 and basically that's how they make their money. The first person who builds a replacement motor gear made of metal will crush Nelson. Paying attention competitors?"
5.0,excellent
1.0,"These used to be hardy effective sprinklers. The new model lacks the front end opening handle, making it very awkward to carry around. The high setting drive gears broke within the first month of use, so it can only run on the low setting at this time (until that also breaks). Mine was used on an established lawn free of obstacles where there were no opportunities for it to get stuck or otherwise wear down the gears."
5.0,LOVE this. Good quality
2.0,"This is way bulkier than I thought it would be, the finish on this product looks poor comparing to the pictures posted."
5.0,"These are great quality, didn't know you could still find something that is.  If they fail I will change this."
1.0,Gave it to my husband for his birthday it won't cut he wanted one for pruning our garden!
5.0,Good pruning shears. Comfortable grip and sharp blades.

5.0,"Short review:  This hose is amazing, Made in the USA, tough as nails yet flexible, will not kink EVER, and I love it.  Buy it now.

Longer review:

I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought ""how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free.""  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it's pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.  Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.

Take my advice, buy this hose, it is worth it.  It's also nice to see it's Made in the USA - at least something is.  Amazing warranty. Even in cooler weather it stays flexible.  Great brass fittings.  They are right, this is the last hose I'll ever buy.  Please, Gilmour, don't try to save on cost in the future - keep this hose just the way it is!

Hope this helps.  Did I mention I love this hose?"
5.0,This hose works as advertised and you can't go wrong. I use it around the house and it never kinks. Highly recommended.
5.0,Always a great product and last forever.  This is my fourth hose around the house and very happy with their products.
3.0,"I purchased this hose almost a year ago now.  I drained it after using it last fall, and stored it in the garage during the winter.  This spring it looked good when I hooked it up.  However, a month or so into this spring, I noticed it was very bulgy in several places.  It also developed a pinhole leak in two places.  I was using it today, and I thought I should write a review describing by experiences.
It is a pretty good quality hose.  The fittings are relatively heavy.  The hose itself is heavy and feels like it is of good quality materials.  However, it apparently has multiple layers which become separated with time.  I have read other reviews that describe this same bulgy appearance.  Mine is two to three times its original circumference.
If you are going to purchase this hose, I would recommend keeping it out of the sun.  I would also be careful to not not store it with water pressure in the line.  It might last more than a year under those conditions.
I probably wouldn't purchase this hose again.  I would expect a cheap hose from a big box store to last as long as this one has.  It does resist kinking, and is heavier than the average garden hose.  I am still using mine, but it leaks whenever I do.  I would not recommend purchasing this product."
5.0,Nice flexible hose wound up great on my power hose winder. Looks like it will last a long time. The brass hose connections were very well made.
4.0,"The hose arrived today, and I wrangled it onto my hose reel. This baby is thick and stiff! I have no doubts that it will hold up, but I am wishing I had bought the 1/2"" version of this product,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-10-Series-8-Ply-Flexogen-Hose-1-2-Inch-x-100-Feet-10-12100-Green/dp/B000NCWOKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 10 Series 8 Ply Flexogen Hose 1/2 Inch x 100 Feet 10-12100 Green</a>&nbsp;and not this one, which is 5/8"" wide.

I'll update the review as I gain experience, but if you have a hose winder and can do with a few less gallons of water per minute,consider buying the narrower version of this product instead."
5.0,I love Gilmour products because they have a lifetime warranty.  All you have to do if anything ever happens to your hose is cut off the ends & send them to the company.  Then they send you new hoses!  Thanks for reading:)
5.0,This hose is better than most.  The fittings fit well and are leak free.  The price was good.  What else would you want?
5.0,"this is the best hose ever, I have a 100 ft. a 50 ft. and the 25. No other hose compares that I know of.
You really shouldn't require so many words in a rating because sometimes it isn't necessary and I might not review anything at all if I need to write so much."
5.0,"I need to have it under pressure all the time in the summer, and it is strong enough to hold up to the task."

2.0,Grips came loose first time I used them. Cuts well so far . Guess I'll gorilla glue the rubber grips.
5.0,good shears very sharp
5.0,Good cutting tool for plants.  Good for trimming aand cutting all sorts of plants or cutting flowers for indoor use.  Can trim thorns and leaves off of roses.  Handy tool.
3.0,Not as good as expected.
2.0,"These shears are very stiff and difficult to use.  They keep locking up, no matter what position I hold them. My husband has larger hands than I do, and he found them difficult to use as well.  I would return them, but I will give them to a gardener f riend."
4.0,They get the job done are well built and getting them on Amazon saved me like 33%

5.0,Item arrived  on time and was as expected.  Works well.
5.0,"Great product, price & seller!"
4.0,"I have a very large yard, tired of moving sprinklers and too cheap to install a sprinkler system.  I'm in Texas, with a predominately Saint Augustine grass yard.  After several weeks and some learning curve, I'm able to use this sprinkler successfully.

The sprinkler housing is very heavy and feels strong and sturdy, made of cast iron.  There are some plastic components which worries me in the Texas sun, but they have performed okay so far.  The instructions were very detailed and easy to follow.  Basically there are 2 speed settings (hi=fast but less water, low=slower but more water), and you can twist the arms up or down to change the distance it throws.  Also, it has a bump button on the bottom that is supposed to work with the plastic stop ramp.  The stop ramp feels cheap and flimsy, not sure how long it will last.  The sprinkler itself feels like it will last at least several years.

Here are some tricks to prevent problems:

1.  Mine gets stuck in bald spots, where there is not a thick grass mat on the ground.  In those spots, the ground gets soft from the watering, and when the wheels reach that spot, they will eventually spin out and dig a rut, just like getting your car stuck.  On areas with a nice continuous grass mat, it works flawlessly.  I resolve this issue by snaking the hose along the thickets parts of the grass to avoid the bald spots.  If I have to run it over a bald spot, I have to peep out of the window every 10 minutes to make sure it's not stuck there.

2.  For every 1 foot the sprinkler moves forward, it add 6 inches of water-filled hose to pull behind it (cause it's a loop that keeps getting larger).  Thus after a long stretch, the hose it's pulling gets heavier and heavier, with more drag against the ground.  This increases the issue mentioned above with getting stuck and spinning out.  So in theory, you could set it to run 100 feet and forget it, but in reality you need to check it.  Mine goes about 50 feet before I have to reposition the hose to prevent it from stalling out.

3.  The bump button works for about 50% of the time.  Once, I laid the leading hose across another hose.  When the sprinkler got to the crossing hose, it struck the bump button and prematurely shut off the sprinkler.  A couple times, I came out to find the runaway sprinkler happily watering about 3 feet past the bump ramp and off of the hose.

4.  In theory, you could snake this thing around a bunch of curves, working between trees and corners.  However, because of the growing length of hose it drags behind it (see No. 2 above), if you have too many turns, or the turns are too sharp, then the hose will start to rub and drag sideways against those objects, and the sprinkler will end up getting stuck in one spot.

Overall, I am happy with this product, and it has made my watering much easier, but it is definitely not a ""set it and forget it"" device - there are too many things that can go wrong so you need to stick around and watch it occasionally."
5.0,"Yep.  Its a hose, delivered right to your hose.
Great quality, no kink, easy to coil.  Get one, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,great hose well made good value for the money I am very happy with it would buy another if needed
4.0,"Has not leaked.  Hose seems sturdy & thick, yet no too much.  I can roll it onto a hose reel easily enough.  Wish they made a retractable one though."
5.0,Heavy but durable with no kinks. Will last for years. Use it daily for gardening and lawn care. Thanks - Ron
4.0,This hose is heavy enough that it doesn't get those kinks. It is easy to move about the yard and put away.
4.0,Will wait on final review till hose goes through cold weather. So far I'm happy with the hose. Hasn't kinked up yet.
1.0,"I hate this hose. It weighs a ton, and kinks and tangles very easily. I swore at it every time I used it. I have drip irrigation now so I rarely have to use a hose now."
5.0,"I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault."
1.0,"This hose is supposed to be flexible.  Its hard, heavy and unwieldy.  I don't know if it kinks or not, because I could tell, as soon as I removed it from the box, that I would have to return it.  If you want a lightweight, soft hose (and I know they exist because I have one), do not buy this thing."
5.0,"I have had a problem with my hoses bursting this summer - 70 psi.  I have a couple of black hoses that hold the pressure just fine but the other heavy duty garden hoses that I have purchased this summer lased t hardly a week - even though I have tried several different brands.  After doing research on hoses I purchased a high pressure contractors hose but had difficulty handling it - too heavy.  I purchased the Gilmour 8-ply and it is exactly what I had been looking for.  It holds the pressure without bursting, doesn't kink too badly, and slides across the grass easily.  I wish that I had found it sooner but none of my local hardware/big box stores carry Gilmour hoses.  As long as I can find them on Amazon I don't ordering them online."
5.0,"I was looking for a few different sprinkler options and landed on this guy because I thought it was kind of fun and the cost to do multiple sprinklers worked out to be the same price. I love it. It gives my yard a nice, slow and deep watering. My wife said to me a few weeks ago, ""I've never seen our yard this green before in the middle of Summer."" I've had it six weeks or so and it's been great."
5.0,Works perfectly! Love my rain train.
5.0,Love the raintrain traveling sprinkler.  Before I was using a sprinkler and setting the timmer.  This stops when it gets to stopper.
5.0,Tractor works great and is easy to operate.  I would purchase again.
5.0,Arrived early and in good shape. Does exactly what is advertised. Very happy with my purchase!
3.0,"Good concept, however there is a learning curve there. Unfortunately, will return it, reasons below:
Pros:
1. You don't need to move it from one place to the other.
2. Simply does the job and stops automatically.
3. Sprays coverage is adjustable by the orientation of the sprayers.

Cons:
1. It is very slow and will take a long time to get through even a small lawn (talking hours here).
2. You can't just leave it and go (which is really difficult since it does take a long time to finish)!
- If you laid the hose with a tight corner, it will just take off the hose and keep going straight to wherever (fence, street, your neighbors lawn...)
- It will get stuck if there is a bump on its way and will just keep spraying this area non-stop. One time I had the hose run through my driveway to go to the side of the lawn and it got stuck in a grove spraying water on the driveway for hours
3. One time the sprinkler came off, so it couldn't move forward and stayed in its place until we noticed the issue.

Bottom line: For me, I still found it needs too much attention that I would resort to regular sprinklers and save water (this consumes a lot since it moves slowly) or spend a bit extra and get an automated system."

5.0,Fantastic!

5.0,sharp
5.0,when i got this product i was a little iffy about it as it is very light and the handles are thin but i must say it has worked better than the super heavy expensive one we had for the farm that broke overall 5 for 5 stars
5.0,"Got the Post Hole digger and promptly went to work... but in the course of researching this I realized that a lot of folks were blaming this tool for weak handles when they didn't realize its true function. These post hole diggers can't be expected to cut through a rock in its path, just like you can't expect to cut a knife with a pair of scissors. You need a long bar; a metal bar around an inch in diameter with a point on one end and a wedge on the other. Use the post hole digger to start the hole. When you run into an obstruction, use the long bar to probe around it. Then, using the long bar, use the wedge part of the long bar to cut roots, the point part to break up rocks. Once you have the obstruction removed, go back to the post hole digger and keep digging down.

Working this way will keep you from ever breaking the handles."
2.0,I broke the handle on my second hole. Be careful when using this item. need more words to complete review more more more more
5.0,"For quite a number of years now I have had a love/hat relationship with post hole diggers.  I love and appreciate a well made and fully functional digger; one that does the job you pay it to do. On the other hand, of all the chores I perform, digging post holes this right at the top of my list of things that would not break my heart if I never had to perform for the rest of my life.  Building fence is a miserable job; especially if you do it by hand.

Now I have what you might call an industrial size post hole digger and have had if for years.  It has heavy pipe handles and made of very heavy gage metal.  It also weighs a bit less than 13 pounds.  It can cut through about anything.  The ""thing"" is very near indestructible.

Why buy the post hole digger being reviewed here?  Well there are several reasons.  The first and probably most important is the fact that I am getting old...almost as old as the dirt I am digging in.  Hefting a tool of this weight over and over and over again has become a monumental task, one that haunts me for days after I use it.  Secondly, I have absolutely no intention of ever, for the rest of my life,  building a fence!  That is why I have large and strong grandsons.  I will keep the old monster for their use.

Now the digger being reviewed here is just what I need.  It is relatively light and for the lighter work I use it for it is perfect.  I have occasions to plant a new shrub or tree, dig smallish holes in building my rock gardens and occasionally take a notion to put in more grape vines which require holes to plant the plant and place the polls for trellises.  I grant you that I could call upon grandsons for this but hey...I do have my pride.

The post hole digger here is not one that you would want for a major fence building project.  It is NOT a heavy duty tool.  The wood is pretty light and I have to tell you that when I first bought it the blades did need a bit of sharpening.  This was easily accomplished using a bench grinder.  I have had no problem with breakage or loosening of the handles.  I keep the thing clean after use and do not leave it out in the elements. (I have a feeling that this thing would not weather constant soaking and sunlight for several seasons like many of my garden tools have had to endure due to my absent mindedness.

The price of this digger is extremely reasonable for what you are getting and the digger is quite effective if you do not ask it to do things it was not built to do.

5.0,"Great tool, works really well.  Like stated in other reviews it is good for occasional use, not everyday use.  But for the price it is well worth it.  Super fast delivery also!"
5.0,"This is a good, basic product.  Shipping was fast and the price is low.  We will be using this product for many years.  Thank you."
4.0,"good tool--had to sharpen blades -good price and quality- i use it to compost all kitchen left overs. I dig a hole around the drip line of my fruit trees and  around my  garden and bury kitchen scraps (paper , coffee grinds, bones , etc.) in the hole. Composted in few weeks. It's called posthole composting."
5.0,"When I decided to do some miscellaneous chores in the yard, I decided to try out the #DG-60. I live on blackland prairie (which is mostly clay and often like cement) so I didn't expect much performance. I was pleasantly surprised. The digger functions well and the handles, while not made of the toughest wood, suffice. I would recommend this item if ""occasional use"" fits your usage. This is not something you'd want to take out to a job site. Otherwise, it's fine for light duty."
1.0,"UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no ""waves"" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.

The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.

When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.

Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.

The Amazon description calls this a ""lightweight"" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).

This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)

I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a ""no-kink"" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality."
5.0,"I've had many bad experiences with the quality of large box store garden hoses in the past.  This hose has made me realize there is something better for a reasonable price.  This hose is firm with high quality fittings.  I have never had a problem with it kinking in the 4 months that I've owned it.  The only downside is that it is a little firm and stiff, probably related to a heavier material in the construction of the hose.  However, this is a good trade off against kinking from my perspective."
5.0,"I purchased one of these hoses many years ago and its still in service. I think I had to replace one of the ends on it, but not a big deal. I love the Flexogen hose because it doesn't kink. Really good stuff!"
4.0,"This is the nicest hose I've ever used.  I'm not a hose connoisseur, but this thing feels durable and very kink resistant.  No leaking at the faucet if its properly tightened."
4.0,"I read all the reviews on every hose created by man and settled for this one----no -I didn't purchase it on Amazon-only because I needed it NOW and ACE is about a mile away.

First thing to note-this hose is heavy - 50 feet is quite a load - it's very substantial

Second of all it really does not seem to KINK-something that was VERY important to me after trying several other hoses and returning them.

Finally-I don't have a hose winder-I just coil it on the ground and it does that quite nicely--then unrolls just as nicely when I begin walking it away from the spigot.

Good hose -happy"
5.0,"Great front yard hose. No kinks and easy to crank in on hose reel compared to other hose owned in backyard. Lightweight compared to old previous hose nand current other hose.. Durable so far. However, only had a short time to evaluate (two months).  Good delivery time."
5.0,"I bought three of these up in different sizes for my yard. Strong and sturdy connections, supple yet strong hose. We have very high water pressure and these handle it well. Good buy and delivered right to my door."
5.0,"This is a good quality hose that I use to connect to my ""Scarecrow"" so as to keep the deer away from my plants. It sits in the sun all day long and so far shows no sign of degradation."
4.0,We like this hose. It's nice and thick  and has good fitting at the end to screw into the sprinklers I just bought as well.
5.0,"I got this hose to hose to replace a ""professional grade"" 1 inch diameter hose that was very cumbersome to move around when I water the garden. I have another Gilmour Flexogen 50 foot hose that didn't quite reach and that is the 1 inch diameter version. I still like it but it wasn't long enough. So I tried this 75 foot 3/4 inch diameter version and it is perfect! I can move it around the garden with no issues at all because it's light-weight, doesn't snag or kink, and is very flexible. My 1 inch one is still flexible in winter so I expect this one will be too. The water flow isn't quite as fast as with the 1 inch, but is still excellent. I hang the 75 footer over a hose bracket in large loops so I don't get any problems with tangling. Just pick up the number of loops you need and walk away, dropping them on the ground one by one. The hose hardly gets twisted at all. So when I'm done, I just go to the bracket and pull the hose in a loop-length at a time and I'm done. The hose is very tough and has a slick finish that doesn't snag and stays cleaner than other hoses. There's also a life-time warranty - just cut the ends off and mail them back and Gilmour will send a new hose! I don't think I'll ever need to do that though as my other hose is still like new after three or four years. The only two small downsides are 1) the hose came in a tight roll so the very end was lightly kinked, but the kink has pretty much disappeared and is no bother, and 2) for a month or so, when I first use the hose, the water that has been sitting inside it has picked up some traces from the hose and should not be used to fill a bird bath - it bubbles a bit as if it's a little soapy until you've run it for 40 seconds or so. I'm thinking of getting another of these for the front yard. Highly recommended."
2.0,"The sprinkler travels fine but when it gets to the dock, the cut off catches in the path guide for the hose and never cuts off. We've attempted to correct any wrong place etc to no avail. If we don't see it get to the dock it ruts out the yard as it digs in."
1.0,Still have not figured this thing out - heavy and could not get it to work???
5.0,I love my Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler. It works so well. I am not always running out to change the sprinkler. It works wonderful for our yeard
5.0,The lazy man's solution to having to constantly move a sprinkler. It will work with 200' of hose and with the shutoff ramp I can set and forget. Does an excellent job.
5.0,my husband loves this as do i. frees up a lot of time from having to change the sprinkler. very durable.
5.0,"Bravo, I have a difficult yard to install sprinklers, and this is the next best thing. It does handle a slight incline, and the shut off ramp works perfect: no dripping."
5.0,We love this sprinkler.  It is a great value
5.0,"Works great, would recommend to others with a large yard."
5.0,"How can you go wrong with a Nelson traveling sprinkler? They save so much time, and going from the old old ones that were solid metal to these one, sure helps out my older family members, where they are light and easy to carry."
5.0,Works just like it's supposed to
3.0,works great
2.0,Flimsy.  Shears tend to bend and jam.  Be careful when using these shears as yon can end up with torn cuts. Locking mechanism is stiff and awkward to use.
3.0,Used these for the first time the other day.  Works OK.
5.0,Quality pruners that are heavy duty but not heavy to handle.
5.0,"Was doing garden work with older equipment when these arrived on my doorstep.  I have many Fiskars garden tools, and this one did not disappoint. Easily pruned the bushes I was hoping to get done. Once again, I would recommend Fiskars to products who have a yard to maintain. FYI--I am a 75-year-old woman caring for a large yard."
5.0,Looking to cut some flowers from your yard? Trim some plants. This is the best. Sturdy. Sharp. Comfortable to use. Safe.
4.0,This is a good quality pair of shears. They work well with the exception that the orange lock button doesn't want to stay in the locked position when I put it there
5.0,Great Clippers. This is my second pair. I have one for the front garden and one for the back yard garden.
5.0,This small tool is handy and my wife loves it. The price is very good ~ about 1/2 price at the local store.
5.0,Very comfortable to use and very sharp!
5.0,thanks
3.0,"It is relatively inexpensive and it would be okay for the light duty occasional user. The metal is shaped on either side to hold the pin that allows the handles to swivel. However, the metal is too thin to remain rigid if you apply any twisting motion at all. I was able to make it sturdier by removing the pin and placing a large stack of washers between metal connection points. If you are going to dig a lot of holes, go for something a lot sturdier."
4.0,Does the job. Good value for the money. Only improvement would be to spend more and get fiberglass handles instead
4.0,Work as expected
4.0,good product
5.0,"Well build, Not bad for the Price.!!!!!!"
4.0,"Did a great job, definitely not professional grade.  I dug over 30 holes w/ this digger; clay and soil.  No issue.  Had to tighten a few bolts on occasion, still holding up fine."
5.0,"Very simple and inexpensive post hole digger -- if that's what you're after, this is it. Depending on the soil composition, it may be helpful to sharpen the blades (any sort of grinder will do this).

We needed to dig out the sump pump in our short crawl space, which has wet soil with plenty of gravel. Didn't bother to sharpen the blades for this job - chopped the handles off about 2/3 of the way up for height clearance reasons, worked as well as anything would in the limited room down there.

The handles had some rough wood in the area that got chopped off, if you were using it full-length you might want to wear gloves or get blisters. As it was, the lower part of the handle was smooth, so that was beneficial to the job too. :)

5.0,"very good price, 1/3 usual"
3.0,"its ok, seems a bit fragile though"
5.0,We are so happy with the Nelson Raintrain Traveling sprinklers that we bought!!!
1.0,Got this sprinkler in but the brass end on the sprinkler where the hose attaches to is not secure. It is loose and water leaks out of it horribly. It is not leaking from the hose but from the brass nozzle on the sprinkler body. This makes the sprinkler lose water pressure and it barely moves. Please process an exchange for this machine ASAP --- thanks.
1.0,"I love these sprinklers, if they work. However, after less than two months, the plastic internal gear that makes the tractor advance has failed. It continually clicks and will not advance making this a useless paperweight. They don't make them like they used to."
5.0,"very sturdy built, works great"
5.0,Makes watering easier and faster using less water. Sprinkler is well built and sturdy. This is my second one. My first one lasted about ten years.
5.0,"I love this sprinkler, and a good price for it...fast shipping.."
5.0,Works well on our yard.  Beats having to move the sprinkler that we had every couple of minutes. this one moves on it's own.
5.0,I love this sprinkler!
5.0,Works great
5.0,Works great
5.0,"This garden hose is excellent, just what I was looking for. It was time to get rid of the old hose and get a new one. I don't have a large deck so I only needed a 25 Foot hose. After reading many reviews, I purchased this hose. Glad I did. It is well made, looks nice, doesn't leak, doesn't kink; a great buy for the money."
5.0,There is not much to say about a hose.  It is well made and durable.  I would recommend it to friends.
5.0,"I got this hose today and it appears to be a nice product, however I want to mention that I thought I was ordering a ""quality"" version of one of those ""expanding"" hoses**.  This is probably my fault for not looking closely at what I was buying, but anyway it just looks like a plain garden hose that you can buy at any home supply or Wal-Mart.  It's just a rubber garden hose.
**I bought one of those ""pocket hose"" things and at first I thought: This is great!!, but after only about 5 or 6 uses it exploded.
My main intent with this review is to help someone else realize that this is NOT and expanding hose.  It was ""mixed in"" with several of those and I thought it was one."
5.0,Excellent quality hose from Gilmour. This hose is nearly impossible to kink while doing yard work and holds up to the weather nicely. Highly recommended for those that wish to buy a garden hose they wish to use and keep for a long time.
5.0,"My first one I purchased back in 2006.  It is still working fine, except it was about 50' too short, so I got another one.
It doesn't kink.  It is pretty good at not getting stuck in roots and whatnot.  The only complaint after 7 years of the first one is that the collar guard has slipped down.  Now, I could probably slide it back up, but I figure to put the new one next to the faucet... Problem solved.
I owned another 'kink free' hose before the flexogen.  Not exactly.  But this one, it really is truly kink free.  The exterior of the old hose looks almost as good as the brand new one.  Give the new one about a week being drug through the dirt, and I suspect they will be identical.  The exterior really is invulnerable, mine lays outside year round.  Don't know about the sub freezing temps though.  I live in Virginia, and it is seldom that cold, and I'm certainly not into yard work when it is."
5.0,"I was so tired of getting hoses and having them last only a year.  I have only had this one three or four weeks but I like it - not too heavy, does not fold in on itself and just seems more durable"
5.0,I have used these hoses for years and they are by far the best hose. Kinkless and very durable and plyable.
5.0,I've finally found a hose that doesn't kink! I am loving this hose and will definitely be replacing all of my hoses with this hose. I only wish I'd found it sooner and bought the longer option!
5.0,Great water hoses - had previously bought the 100' and it has worked out well for me.  I needed two replace two old 75' hoses so I got purchased two more of this same brand.  Very pleased with them as you will be too.
4.0,"Arrived on time works good does not twist so those are good features.  However , I really can't get to excited about reviewing a hose."
5.0,They worked great so far.
5.0,Excellent product.  Very ergonomic.
5.0,These are perfect for me. Nice and sturdy.
5.0,great
5.0,nice find
5.0,GREAT
1.0,After one use they stopped opening on their own. Now I have to open the clippers manually after each cut. Less than desirable.
5.0,super sharp.  Got it on Amazon Day.  Great deal.  Used it to make my wedding bouquet.  Would repurchase.
5.0,fiskars quality at a great price
5.0,Excellent Shears!
4.0,"This worked well.  It's a post hole digger so not terribly much you can say about it one way or another, but for the price I was happy.  My only complaint is this was supposed to be new but was obviously used prior and returned.  It was heavily scratched and had dirt on it right out of the box.  Not a huge deal since I'm sure it'd look the same once we used it once, but it was disappointing."
4.0,works as it should; good buy for the price
4.0,"A bit clunky, but gets the job done."
4.0,I ll take it. if your are not picky. will do the job
4.0,"Cheap as hell feeling, this might be a harbor freight special. Only good after 3-4 uses and throw it away. I've only used these once so only time will tell."
5.0,"The quality on these is better for the price than the PHDs they sell at Home Depot and Walmart.  After receiving these, I checked the ones they sold at HD and Walmart and could tell the steel on their 'economy' level post hole diggers was thinner and they were noticeably lighter in weight than these.  Haven't used them yet, but I see no reason to believe they would disappoint."
3.0,Not bad for the price
5.0,Good quality at a good price.
4.0,"For the price, it does the job. I needn't dig that many holes, so for the money, it fits my needs."
4.0,Works great
4.0,Had ours for 15 years and it still works great. Except for the ramp which broke and I can't find a replacement.
5.0,It works great.
4.0,good
4.0,Works as described
5.0,Works good
2.0,Only had the product 2 weeks when the nosel popped off of one of the arms. Now I am unable to use it until I figure out how to get the arm fixed or replaced.
4.0,"I like the concept of this design and find that it accomplishes a lot of the watering that used to take a lot of my time moving sprinklers around for! It has saved me tons of time this summer. I just place this on a hose route with my 100 ft hose and let it slowly crawl over a large area of lawn and it gets watered over hours and hours of crawling.  It is adjustable diameter water pattern which makes it quite versatile for accommodating many different sized areas. I have a large lawn area and flower beds and I can set this to go near the flower beds and get both that and the lawn area adjacent in one pass.

Now for some details and quirks which prevents the 5th star. In fact I would give it 3 stars if not for the fact that it does save me time and covers a big task far more easily than the oscillator sprinkler movements I used to do.

This sprinkler is beefy. It's all metal except for the wheels and some parts where the sprinkler tubes that rotate come out and the piston on the bottom are plastic. When a 100 ft. water filled hose is attached to it and you are trying to pull it across the lawn, it's not for lightweights. This device has 2 speeds, Lo and Hi.  Both change the gear ratio such that the crawling a little faster in Hi gear than Lo. The idea behind the two gears is to vary the amount of water you put down on the lawn by changing the movement speed. The instructions provide a chart that shows the inches of water it will lay down for a given diameter size water pattern and speed of crawl. You can select the diameter and speed for your needs. I discovered that the smaller the diameter, the faster the Lo and Hi speed is. This is because the smaller diameter results in the spray nozzles rotating at a faster speed, hence faster crawling. This makes sense since the water flow rate to the lawn is faster so you wouldn't want it going the same speed for huge diameter vs small diameter.  Keep this in mind when setting the diameter and how much time it will take to crawl the hose to the bridge.

Diameter is determined by the angle of the two spray tubes squirting out the water. The angle can be changed from slightly downward (relative to a horizontal plane) on up to about 45 degrees. This claims to have a maximum diameter of 55 ft but I haven't seen that to be true for my well and pressure tank system. Minimum diameter I haven't measured but probably about 8-10 ft. You adjust the tube arms by twisting them in the rotating base T-socket. Each arm has a sleeve nut that tightens up around the tube on threads. It is possible to have it fairly tightened to prevent the water pressure pushing the tube out (which I have had happen several times) but also possible to have it tight enough to not be able to turn the tubes. It's a narrow line between too tight (can't turn the tubes) and not tight enough where the tubes work their way out of the socket and pop out. But it's do-able with some practice and it works fine then.

On the bottom side of the tractor is a piston/spring trigger. If it is pushed up into the belly of the tractor, it stops the water flow. When you pull it out, it opens the valve and sprays water out the tubes. The point of this is to allow auto-shutoff when the tractor crawls over a ""bridge ramp"" placed on the hose where you want it to stop crawling. This bridge (which is provided) is yellow (see photos of it) and Is placed so as to straddles the hose. It is wide enough for the front wheels to ride up and over the bridge ramp. But the back wheels straddle it allowing the bridge to cause the piston to be pushed up as it tries to pass over it, shutting off the water and therefore the crawling action. So far this action has had mixed success for me. in principle it works. When the piston encounters the ramp of the bridge, it pushes it up and stops water flow. The problem I've had with it is this: if you aren't able to get the ramp low enough in the grass, I've had multiple times where the piston catches on the cut-out of the bridge ramp where the hose passes through. I've carefully examined why and it's because the ramp is not low enough relative to the clearance of the tractor belly. The bridge has a single fold-out thin metal rod that is meant to poke down in the sod to help hold the bridge in place and as low as possible. However, I think having thick grass or soft soil reduces the effectiveness of this rod in holding it down low close to the grass dirt level.

This piston shutoff/on valve is very slick for being able to stop the sprinkler, move the sprinkler and then restart it without having to go back to the water source valve and turning it off and then on again. I typically set up the tractor, push in the piston in (it doesn't always grab without water flow but keep trying to push it in till it sticks.) Then go turn on the water. Then return to the tractor and standing where it won't spray me, I reach under and pull out the piston. Water sprays and I adjust the angle of the water diameter to fit the current need. Then I place the front wheel on the hose and run fast to get away without getting too wet. I wish the design were changed to have the rod extend up through the top of the tractor so as to provide easier access from both top and bottom sides, pushing/pulling the piston from either side.

This sprinkler will not work in dirt flower beds. The ground will get wet, soft, then muddy and the wheels will get stuck in the mud. So don't bother trying this or buying it for that type of use. This is intended for lawn. The spiked wheels are designed to grab the turf to get traction to pull up to a 100 ft hose filled with water after it. That requires a lot of force for this little guy. But it has good pull power.

I use the Flexzilla Garden Hose, 5/8 in. x 100 ft., which is a fabulous hose as hoses go. I have found that it works ok with this sprinkler most of the time. I've had multiple times where the front wheels jump the hose and it wanders off on it's own random course. This is not good if you have left it alone thinking it will stop on the bridge ramp. I've had it run into flower beds and get stuck digging the wheels in the mud and going deeper and deeper. This jumping the hose issue almost always occurs on a corner. They claim it can handle curves of 8 ft radius but I'm skeptical as I've had it jump the hose with more gradual curves even. This could be due to this hose being more squishy than your traditional hose. It also could be due to the 5/8"" hose size. But if I were to get a 3/4"" hose, the length it can track and pull behind is reduced. I also think lawn unevenness on a curve may also contribute, but that is just a thought, not proven. BTW, I would not use this sprinkler on 1/2"" hose it won't work well at all for tracking.

Other nits I have against this device is that it leaks around the hose connection. It's worst leak is on the backside of where the connector attaches. I plan to contact the mfgr about this ""defect?""

To summarize the quirks:
* Don't try to track this along the length of a slope. It will roll over. I've had that happen, found the tractor upside down and one of the arms disconnected. Fortunately it wasn't broken, just popped out. This rollover occurred due to jumping the hose and going where it wasn't intended.
* Don't track too small a curve. It usually jumps the hose track doing that. Perhaps a 3/4"" hose or a traditional stiffer hose will work better for this.
* Make sure the bridge ramp for shutoff uses the foldout rod and pick a spot that allows it to hold the bridge as close to the surface of the soil as possible.
* Don't try to use this in dirt areas such as flowerbed. Go beside them on lawn. Extend the diameter of the spray to cover the flowerbeds.

Advice to the manufacturer:
* Make the tractor wider so it's not so top heavy for slopes.
* Make the piston rod be accessible both top side and bottom side of the tractor.
* Have it stop if it detects hard resistance so as to avoid grinding the gears if it runs into a wall, tree, or other immovable object. I haven't had this happen yet but it could."
5.0,"Had couple b4.  Beats moving it so much, just set & go."
4.0,"I have always loved traveling sprinklers and used them frequently.  This one worked well on flat level surfaces, but constantly fell over it it met any incline or divot in the yard."
5.0,"More than ten years ago, I purchased an Orbit Traveling Sprinkler for our acre of lawn. It has worked relatively well.
The motor of a traveling sprinkler is its spinning arms, driven by garden hose water pressure. As the arms spin, they drive the rear axle and spiked wheels through a small transmission. The transmission is a simple set of gears, that allow for the selection of two forward speeds, or neutral for stationary use.
The front wheel of a traveling sprinkler straddles the garden hose that feeds water to the spinning arms, guiding the sprinkler where it should go. I use two 100', 5/8"" hoses that can reach all corners of my acre from my main yard water source. You can use more or less hose depending upon the size of your lawn. Generally, I lay the hose on the path I want the sprinkler to travel, and turn the end that is connected to the sprinkler back on itself, forming a loop of hose behind the sprinkler as it sits astride the hose. When the water is then turned on, the sprinkler travels back along the hose towards the water source. There is a small plastic ramp that comes with the sprinkler, that clamps on to the hose at the position you want to turn the sprinkler off. The ramp depresses a shut-off plunger valve on the underside of the sprinkler as it passes over. This is very handy in case you forget it is out there and running; because it will invent its own path if it runs out of hose to travel on.
The Orbit sprinkler has worked dependably for longer than I had expected. But I think it might be better suited to smaller yards than my own. While most manufacturers boast that their sprinkler will travel 150' - 200' per set, the Orbit would struggle with those distances, even when traveling in a straight line. 75' - 100' of filled water hose is quite a load to be dragging through the grass. It would not negotiate even a broad 90 turn on the hose without over-turning if the trailing loop of hose was very long.
I got in the habit of checking on the Orbit sprinkler often when it was running. It did not require much of an anomaly to cause the sprinkler to stall, dig a hole, or turn on its side and stop. It travels slower than I expected it to. Knowing all of this about it, I simply made it an hourly chore to see how it was doing. I also got in the habit of pulling the trailing hose loop out from behind it to form a longer path going forward, and to take the load off of it. This pretty much eliminated stalls and over-turning events. It seems to have been slowing down a little lately. If I put it into high gear it would sometimes stall, and I would find the sprinkler arms stopped, spewing streams of water into puddles. In low gear it would rarely stall. Because of all this I stopped using its shut-off ramp, because I knew I'd be out checking on it soon anyway.
Concerned about the Orbit Traveling Sprinkler, I began looking into other solutions. While doing so, I found a Nelson 'Raintrain' traveling sprinkler on Amazon (free shipping) for less than I remember paying for the Orbit. I have used it for a couple of days now, and am very impressed with it.
Out of the box I noticed the Raintrain is much heavier and sits higher off the lawn. Its hose connection is accessible, where the Orbit is almost impossible to get a hand on for connecting the hose. When I connected it up and turned on the water, the first thing I noticed was the sprinkler arms were spinning much faster than those on the orbit, even in high gear. I went out to check on it after the first hour, and it had traveled further than the Orbit would have in three hours. Of course, faster travel may mean less water delivered to the lawn. I set it up on a 150' straight run and it performed without a hitch, moving just as quickly towing a 75' loop of hose behind as it did with just 3' of loop. I then set it up on a 25' straight, followed by a 100' sweeping turn, something I knew from experience the Orbit could not do, and it again performed without a hitch.
Last evening I disassembled the Orbit transmission to see if there was something causing it not to perform well. Everything was in good shape; but I did find a slight nozzle blockage in one of the sprinkler arms, which would cause a slowdown. It was not sufficient enough a blockage to be apparent to the eye while it was running, as it seemed there was plenty of water coming through both nozzles. I am reassembling it now to see if it runs a little stronger.
I am posting this for anyone who might not know of these traveling sprinklers, or for anyone considering purchasing one. The Orbit Traveling Sprinkler is a good unit, but I think it might be better suited to smaller yards, 1/4 acre or less) where not many path turns are required. It's a little lighter and easier for mama or one of the children to pack around. The Nelson Raintrain is a performer, better suited to larger yards, and can handle curves better. They are both good units for their design. My confidence is building in the Raintrain, so that I am not as obliged to make hourly checks any longer."
5.0,"I've now had this hose for going on two years. It's just perfect. Such a step up from the junk hoses I was buying from hardware stores. Flexible, no kinking issues. Rolls like a dream on my hose reel. I love the color and I love how soft and supple it feels on a nice hot summer day. I liked this one so much, I bought a 1/2"" 50 footer for my front yard and have been just as pleased with that one."
4.0,"This is the best hose I've used so far. I bought one of these last year and added this second one this year, and will probably buy another one soon. It works great! I've has no kinking problems. It is thickly constructed, not like the flimsy hoses on the market today. This one is built to last. The only drawback to the hose is that it is heavier than many other hoses, but it hasn't been a problem for us. A well-made product built to last."
4.0,"Nicely made,very heavy though..the price you pay for something that doesn't kink that easy. The weight might shorten the life of the hose reels made of plastic."
5.0,"I am so happy with this hose that I bought 3 more!  Very flexible, hardly ever kinks and easily coiled onto a hanger.  Not the most lightweight hose out there, but lighter than just about any other of this quality.  I was able to handle 100 feet easily and I am a 5'2"" female 120lbs and 62 years old!!!"
3.0,"Very heavy...can't lift it from box  will keep and give to my son.
Too heavy to return --cost not worth it."
5.0,I bathe my big dog outside in the warm weather and I hook this hose up to my basement tub sink faucet to keep the water warm due to his arthritis. I then put the hose through a trap door to go outside so I can regulate the temp to keep his achy joints from getting too cold. It works great!
5.0,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had, and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year, but very long, hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
3.0,"It is probably a great hose for a man, but it is very heavy for me and I have trouble rolling it on the reel.  For the money it is okay but I will probably give it away and purchase a lighter weight one."
4.0,"As hoses go, this one seems to be very well made. However, I find it to be neither leak free at the couplings, nor kink free until fully extended with water on. Hang mine on the Yard Butler, so it comes off rolled up and gets twisted and pinched until laid out across yard. Still a good hose for the money. Be sure to check all vendors and available sizes for best buy."
3.0,"As others stated in their reviews, the hose leaks at the faucet.  It is not terrible, but still it leaks.  Otherwise I like this hose.  Very flexible and easy to roll up when finished.  I do not have any problem with kinks.  I am happy with it, but don't like the minor leaking around the faucet end."
3.0,The two halves were not aligned properly and it was difficult to open all the way. Took me twice as long as it should have to dig a hole for my mailbox.
5.0,"My husband needed to dig holes to put up a deer fence for the garden. Since then he has dug over 50 holes for tomato stakes. It digs holes, it will not go through big rocks, you will need another tool for that. It has a sharp enough metal digging part for our NJ rocky soil. Compared to the cheap old one he had this is much better and he is very happy."
5.0,"You know I wasn't sure how well this would work, but it does a pretty good job.  I figured it would work like a shovel and you'd step on it, but you just drive it in the ground and scoop it out, and before too long you've got a pretty decent hole.

I'd say it took less than 5 mins to dig a fence post through reasonably compacted soil.  Can't complain with that..."
5.0,The cheapest post hole digger I could find.  Works well.  Only wish it was motorized.  I don't think the fancy ones that cost more would work any better.
3.0,"The handles are very poorly finished, absolutely must wear heavy work gloves when using or you will end up with some king size splinters in your hands."
4.0,"I was afraid that at this price the tool would turn out to be flimsy. It is not. Although I could hardly call it ""heavy-duty,"" it is decently made and practical for light -too medium tasks."
4.0,Very sturdy design.  The wood handles are sturdy and bolted well to the blades.  If you are doing many holes I would recommend a gas powered postholer.
5.0,"This was the cheapest post hole digger that I could find, and I want cheap because I only need to dig 3 post holes and none of my friends or relatives have a post hole digger to lend me, so I figured I would take the leap and become that person that has one to loan out when needed.

Got the package this afternoon, opened it up, inspected it to make sure no manufacturer defects and dug three 2-foot post holes in clay.  No roots and minimal rocks, so I used a spud bar to pry the rocks (post hole digger is not meant to pry rocks and bust through roots!).  The post hole digger cut quite well through the thick clay, and it took me no time to complete the task.

I wore gloves because the handles are not finished quality and would tear up your hands, especially if you have more than a few holes to dig.  I might sand the handles nice and smooth and then stain/seal to keep it in good shape for the future."
5.0,"This is the same Name Brand Item you would buy at brick-and-mortar stores only at a steep discount.  Of course, we live in a remote area of Montana and Montana stores gouge you / over charge you  badly.  With Amazon Prime, it gets delivered to our door within 48 hours (no one in Montana does anything within 48 hours) for free.  IT'S MAGIC!  We love Amazon.  We love the quality.  And we love the prices - plus, it saves us gas and time."
3.0,I purchased this because I only have to dig a few holes and this should be fine. If I had to dig more I would have hired someone.
5.0,"Works great - exactly as advertised (which I really appreciate these days)... Just adjust the spray arm angle and it covers the entire width of our yard perfectly.  Follows about 80 feet of hose, comes to the stop actuator, turns itself off and is done!  I use the ""fast"" speed setting and it applies a good amount of water in about 90 minutes.  The yard is level, but a bit bumpy/lumpy with a few dips that don't seem to effect it."
5.0,I'm very pleased with my traveling sprinkler.  We have had one before just like it so I knew all about the tractor.  Sure beats going out & moving the other kinds every 30 minutes to 1 hr.
5.0,I absolutely love this sprinkler...it covers a lot of ground and it moves by itself...heavy duty steel and durable...it is well worth the money!
1.0,Product advertises a cast iron body but was just plastic filled with sand. Product only lasted 4-1/2 months with very low use & both the high range & low range gears stripped out. Very disappointed & will never by this brand sprinkler tractor again!!!
5.0,"Why has it taken me so long to find out about this amazing sprinkler? I love it and so does my grass. I have 1/2 St Augustine and 1/2 Bermuda but it travels over both evenly.  I watched nervously as it docked the first few times but it performed perfectly.  My neighbors comment on my new toy with envy.  It is quite heavy,  so be cautious when you lift it.  My yard man told me his father has had one for years.  It is impossible where I live to have an inground watering system, so this is the next best."
5.0,"I love it, I turn it on when I get home from work and don't have to worry about moving it around. It is much easier and less expensive than installing a sprinkler system. The only problem is I can't seem to find a 200'  hose, but it works great and so far it has never ""jumped the track"". I am ordering a second one today for my back yard."
5.0,working well so far
5.0,Great sprinkler.  Works as described.
5.0,works-- gets the job done
4.0,"It cannot travel through mud or climb over rocks on your lawn, but it will lay down a ton of water customized to a spray range and path you select. I've had mine for five days and love it...definitely exceeded expectations. Buy a long hose, don't create sharp turns with it, and let it do its thang."
4.0,Cuts great I like it
5.0,Great tool...I've already worn out a pair of these after years of use. So happy I found these for such a great price.
4.0,So far it's great for cutting my rose bushes. They do a clean cut too.
1.0,this item was defective (bent).  Unfortunately I wqited too long to return it.  Think twice.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and expected. Very powerful for such a small tool.
5.0,"Great for clipping vegetables, nice handle with comfort grip.  Works great!"
4.0,Great Shears
5.0,comfortable grip and cuts nicely. I've been using it to trim my rose bushes and they're blooming like crazy now!
5.0,Totally fine!
5.0,great sharp shears for the price
5.0,"I have gotten hose through the years, and they stay outdoors, and they last about a couble of years, so I brought a more pricely one, this one, so I hope it last longer. It works great now, and hope it will least more than 2 years staying outdoors. It nice an strong, so I'm sure it will least."
5.0,"Love the hose
Better price than buying in store
Shipped timely and as described. We have 3 of them for our house and all are in good shape after years of use."
3.0,"This hose works fine but it is not flexible at all.  I serves its purpose but I expected it to be more flexible with a name like ""Flexogen."""
5.0,Very sturdy hose and manageable enough for me to use. I would recommend it. Not much else to say about a hose.
4.0,The hose is a good buy.  I like the way it rolls up on the holder each time it is used.
5.0,This is a good hose for a good price.  I read many of the reviews on this hose & was pleased to learn the company stood behind their guarantee.
3.0,So far so good. Little firmer than expected. No kinking thus far. Decent price. Would recommend to other buyers. Satisfied
4.0,it was delivered on time and is as advertised.  I am completely satisfied with it.  I believe that it will last me a long time.
5.0,I have not had a chance to use this yet. It has rained so much.  Good thing.  It is still as on the patio.  sorry can't reveiw yet.
3.0,"It is OK. Better than the really cheap Home Depot store hose I tried first. I only need it for light duty. It seems good about not kinking, though it leaks a bit at the thin brass faucet coupling end- that may just be due to the washer. But I'm disappointed at how stiff it is. Even in warm temperatures it doesn't easily coil on a simple wall hose hanger."
4.0,"Very light duty, but the price is right.  Don't expect it to last forever, don't expect it to bust hard pan.  For occasional, light duty work, this one does the job."
5.0,"Just the tool we wanted, could not have been any simpler to order, used it four times works great thanks"
5.0,This works and it's light weight.  Enjoyed watching my husband & future son-in-law standing around looking at the hole they had dug for a bush with little effort.  They were so proud of themselves.
5.0,"No Joking Here!  I let her do the gardening as she loves it!  She wanted to put in new bushes, so she asked for this and has had a ball with it.  So as long as she is having fun with it, and it not giving me hell, you get 5 stars!!!"
3.0,"little bit flimsy but it did the job. Felt like I was going to break it. Great price though. If it makes it through two seasons, I'll be happy"
4.0,Who woulda known there was something like a promotional Post Hole digger. Well to let you know it works just as good as a regular post hole digger but cheaper. Like any digging be ready for your muscles to be sore the next day.
3.0,"I tried to dig on soft and wet soil. It worked very well. However, it won't work well on dry and hard soil, It won't work on hard pan soil neither. Wet the soil first and it will be much easier. The blade is not sharp enough for hard soil. The construct is Ok for the price which is cheapest compare to other."
5.0,"My husband needed these for work and the price was so good we bought two. We thought they might be too good to be true but after a few months of daily use, still good! The handles are sturdy and they dig well."
5.0,I'd buy another if this one broke.  Worked as advertised but also need a fence post bar to break up the dirt first.
3.0,"Unbelievable price for a post hole digger.  Do not put too much stress when expanding the arms.  It is not a heavy duty digger so the advertisement is correct.  I have red clay and it worked well in soft, wet sol.  I have not tried it on dry, baked dirt.  For the price, it satisfied my needs."
5.0,"Finally, a quality sprinkler that works exactly as promised! I couldn't be happier."
1.0,"After using this crawler sprinkler for only three days (2 hours a day), the spray bar orifice on one arm blew out of the arm rendering the unit inoperative!!  Very unhappy with the apparent quality of this unit made in China!

To make matters worse, I called the company's help number if one had problems, and was told they would send me a new arm assembly that would take seven to ten days to get here!!  It didn't take half that long to receive the unit in the first place."
1.0,"While the product is sturdy and well made, the arms will not stay in the connector and fly out as soon as the water is turned on. "
5.0,Just what I needed to water my grass.
5.0,"Not as good as an in-ground system, but well worth the money for ease of use!  Solid and well constructed.  Seems like it will last a LONG time."
1.0,"First time used it fell apart. The button on the bottom flew off and if your grass is longer than 1"" it switches off all the time. Not made like the old ones"
5.0,"I have only had this about a month but let me say that I love it and it does exactly what I want it to do. Easy setup, and the little champ is saving me from moving a sprinkler ten times."
2.0,"The first time I hooked up this unit, one of the spray arm tips flew off.  No way to find it in the grass.  Very disappointing.  I'll contact them on the next working day and I hope they stand behind their product."
4.0,"Works great, it replaces a green one that broke.  This one seems to be a little better quality then the green one."
5.0,Works great would reorder again
4.0,"The levels of soil strata here in my area of Michigan are clay, hardpan, and sand.  This punched through the clay, needed some help with the hardpan from an inherited trench hole shovel , and finished the hole nicely.
A nice, lightweight tool."
4.0,"Bought this to dig a few holes as I was rebuilding some deck stairs, it is exactly what it said it was, light weight not for heavy duty jobs. I only dug 4 holes in very hard clay-like dirt worked fine for me..."
2.0,"I liked the feel of it. However, The tongs are a bit rigid and I must work harder with this than with others in the past."
2.0,"Maybe all post hole diggers work this poorly, but this one was so lousy that it was far easier to get on my knees and dig out the hole with a trowel after loosening the soil with a digging bar. This tool just couldn't pick much up. Skip it entirely or spring for a better one if you really think you need it."
5.0,"This post hole digger does what I need to do.
Needed it to install a deck for a pool ladder.
What else could I say."
4.0,"It does the job which is digging post holes.
I'm giving it 4 stars because the wood handle doesn't feel very strong. I only used it to dig 4 holes. If you have many holes to dig and will use it from time to time, you'd better buy one with fiberglass handles.
In a word, I am happy with this for $20."
5.0,These work great for my light duty digging needs around the house.  I wouldn't use these for a commercial project but they are perfect for my backyard projects and fit the budget.  I have other Seymour tools and cultivators and I am equally pleased with them as well.
5.0,"The post hole digger arrived yesterday (a day earlier than promised) and we dug 18 holes with it.  I would rate the required effort as relatively low, which is good.  Previous techniques resulted in backaches.  None this time.  Perhaps another post hole digger would have performed similarly, but this one had the lowest price.  The construction is simple, almost primitive, but substantial.  It is an excellent value."
2.0,"I used mine to replace fence posts and found it was necessary to take out the ground for the fence posts at 1/2 the holding capacity that the post hole digger holds.

The handles are very flexing so don't go too fast with it."
5.0,"simple tool that works well for what it is designed. dug 4 - 2.5' holes in about 15 minutes in rocky, clay."
4.0,"I would have rated this perfect, but once again I have purchased a hose that was not supposed to kink, and it did kink on me the other day.  I was really disappointed, because I have come to believe that there is no such thing as a non kink hose.  It does not kink as easily as the all the others I have had that say they 'guarantee' not to kink, so at this point I am pleased about that.  It's sturdy and it feels substantial.  I'd buy another."
1.0,"Bought 3 of these hoses as I'm planting grass throughout roughly 3+ acres of grass.  Need hose length to get to all areas.  Those of you who have watered know the pain of having to go back and unkink the hose constantly - well - this was the case with these hoses.  I'm sure it may have had something to do with the first week of use being that they are tightly packaged - however - these kinked constantly.  Made the task more frustrating.  I sent them back and ordered Apex 8640-100 NeverKink Extra Heavy Duty 3000 5/8-Inch by 100-Feet Hose.  These do as they say - have never had a kink and they work great in all other areas.  I've had cars and my 21 ft truck drive over both hoses and both hold up fine.  Yes, water pressure was was on full for both hose uses.  I will never buy the gilmour again and, while a hose is a hose - nothing to get excited about - sure am glad the new hoses work without kinks."
5.0,"For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.  They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.  This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.  It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.  Quite a company!"
4.0,BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS.  SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE. KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES.
1.0,"I use this hose to water flower beds on the days that the irrigation system does not run.  I live in south Texas and watering is a daily requirement if you want plants to stay alive.  This hose is extremely heavy and hard to move around.  While not supposed to kink, it does so on every use.  I would not buy again."
1.0,"Both the original and the replacement hose sprayed water from the base of the connecting nut. The attaching nut, the one that attaches the hose to the spigot was very loose and I was able to move it up and down at the connection to the metal housing that was crimped to the hose."
5.0,This hose is great and exceeds expectations.  It is extremely durable and has many different settings!  Love it & highly recommend it!
5.0,"Looked in all of the box stores for a hose like this one and they were all sold out.  Quality seems excellent, very satisified"
5.0,"if like me, you are tired of kinking hoses, leaking hoses, hoses that bust off at the end, etc.  buy this, you will NOT be disappointed!"
2.0,"This hose is real kinky.
And not in a good way.

I find myself constantly adjusting the hose to remove all of the kinks ... it's a real pain.

I would not recommend this product."
5.0,good quality
5.0,This is the third time I have purchased this product. Really like it a lot.
5.0,Sharp and suitable for my purposes!  Would buy again~
5.0,"excellent product, easy to use"
5.0,Have used Fiskars pruners for many years.
4.0,These are good quality pruning sheers (if I just wouldn't keep misplacing them!). A good product I will buy again.
5.0,"snip snip, these will get the jobs done.
price competitive with box stores"
5.0,They are awesome glad I purchased them!!!
5.0,"This was a great price on these Fiskars shears. I've had great luck with these in the past and have no reason to think that will be any different with this pair.
Edited to say that I got these for $10 on sale at Amazon. I am seeing bad reviews for them and have not used mine more than a half hour or so at this point. They worked well for me and I have had none of the problems that other users mentioned so far, but I was only doing light pruning of small diameter wood."
5.0,This is my favorite pruner and I got it at a great price! I lose one every year or so. I probably throw it into the bin with the clippings. I got two this time and will set one back as my next replacement.
5.0,Love this heavyweight monster.
3.0,"The Raintrain  traveling sprinkler is nice but it jumps the hose way to much.  I bought it because I always forget to move the sprinkler but now if I forget to check it it might be out in road or up against the house or the car.  It is nice but has a few problems for me.  If it didn't jump the track it would be perfect.
Deb from Prineville Or."
3.0,liked it but never can leave it alone. always goes off track and end up in random places. road neighbors fence
4.0,"I`ve had it a few years now with light use. I originally bought 100 ft. of heavy duty rubber hose and a hose cart to use with this sprinkler but it didn't work out so well. The hose caused too much of a drag after 20 ft. or so. It would bog down and just sit and flood the area once the hose to be dragged got too heavy. Replacing it with ""regular"" garden hose did the trick. I still don't totally trust it...it isn't something you can set out and trust it will go the full length of your run and shut off as designed. I still occasionally have to ""nudge"" it along but I am happy with it. You just have to take a peek every now and then."
5.0,"Had one many years ago, loved it then and love this one as well.  So long having to go out and move the sprinkler ever half hour!"
5.0,This thing is awesome! Easy set up!
5.0,Love it!!
5.0,"~...okay- when i have friends over and i'm walking them around ""the Berm"" (lush/lavish planted trail directly around my house), i always like to have my 'RainTrain' traveling...it's a wonderful visual and waters well, too...a true blast that works and is earthy&addictive...i glued sunglasses on the front of mine...awesome...michael p.~"
4.0,nice
1.0,"I had a similar Nelson traveling sprinkler for 30 trouble-free years, until it just wore out. I ordered this one, and after two days I already despise it. The little shut of mechanism on the belly of the thing is triggered by the slightest irregularity of the ground surface. It just won't work on my yard - the same yard the old one worked fine on for 30 years - without me continually having to go out and reset it. How did they test this thing - run it on Astroturf? Now I have to waste time figuring out how to disable the stupid shut off so I can actually use the sprinkler.

Unless your lawn is as smooth as a pool table, get something else."
4.0,"Have used hose only a short time but is flexible and so far has not had a kinking problem, therefore good handling while hand watering."
5.0,"Got this to work with a travelling sprinkler. It does feel more substantial than the less expense hoses I have and unlike them, I have not even come close to experiencing any kinking problem. Using it with a quality Ames rolling cart for storage. I found the pricing comparable to the big box home supply stores."
5.0,This 100 foot hose is easy to maneuver andf is well made.  Does not kink or twist because of the 8 ply construction.
3.0,"Heavy duty construction, but does occasionally kink; also it's not as easy as I'd hoped, to rewind on a reel"
4.0,"I just used this hose today,and it did kink up on me,but i easily straightened it out.
No leaks so that's a plus right there.
I used this on a wall reel-up and was kind of wondering if the full 100' would wind up on the reel,answer yes it did,relief.
I would recommend this hose very well made,but it is stiff at times but i can live with that.
The color of this hose reminds you of what a garter snake looks like,still cool though.
And if your getting a drink from this hose there is no after taste like rubber.
So i'm glad i purchased this,came UPS 3 day delivery time from Charleston,Tennessee.
Has 4 covered-wire ties to hold it in place."
5.0,"I have been using Flexogen 8 Ply hoses for over a decade.
My old ones are still fine, they still coil up easily and are still flexible.
These are very heavy duty yet very flexible and made with strong brass connectors
I just bought another one because I needed a longer one"
5.0,"I had just bought some apex never kink hoses and they are decent they are hard to kink and do the job but these Gilmour hoses are 10 times better they are actually harder to kink than the ""never kink"" hose and they are just built better all around the hoses are heavier and have better coupling joints I will never buy another brand of hoses after these. I live in the high desert with three big dogs so I need something that can take a beating and these have done their job."
5.0,"I have several Flexogen hoses and have never had a problem. They can be a little stiff when cold, but what hose isn't. I've never been able to make one kink in normal use. Made in the USA, I really like that!"
5.0,"Just remember, 25 ft isn't very long, so when you get the hose it may look shorter than you think.
It's a great hose, even in the winter.
I used it all winter to wash my truck and it never kinked once.
I wanted a short hose for winter so I didn't have to lug my 100' heavy hose around.
This is a nice quality hose, and I'm pretty sure it's made in USA also."
3.0,"I was hoping that this hose would be something better than what you typically find at home improvement centers.  It isn't.  It's no worse but no better.  It's just a hose.  Price was OK, but I'm getting another hose this week and I'll just go to Lowes or Home Depot"
5.0,Loved it
5.0,Does the job well would by again.
5.0,great
1.0,"When I received these clippers my first reaction was ""They must have sent the wrong product."" The clippers felt clunky and looked cheap. On the very first cut the chrome plating on the blades started peeling off. The blades dented shortly after while trimming 1/4 inch branches on my Japanese maple tree and dulled within 10 minutes. I do not recommend this product."
4.0,Arrived timely and fits description. Have not used yet but appears to be a good product
1.0,"Should have read the reviews before buying!  Initially you will find the cutting process handle to be somewhat sticky.  Thinking nothing of that as the pruning went along very well for about 1 month.  All of sudden, it is not even able to cut paper!  The blades have become misaligned over such a short period of time.  The only good thing (or bad) is Amazon replaced it immediately with another one without question.  Now we will see how long these new ones will last.  I would recommend first to read all reviews first before buying and then probably pay more for better quality."
3.0,Ok but not much better than other hand pruners I have. I thought that being Fiskars they would have better cutting action.
5.0,Cuts well and not awkward to use and I'm left handed!
5.0,works great - no complaint
5.0,This brand is reliable! I like a good pair of pruning shears to last long past the summer months! It's like that particular bunny that keeps on going!
1.0,ended up with 2 and both seized up
5.0,Love this!
5.0,Works great very large watering area
5.0,"I thought it was too good to be true, but this thing works great!"
4.0,I like the ability to set it fast or slow and the auto shutoff.  I can't help but wish the shutoff and the back of the tractor were metal along with the front
5.0,"It's always a pain buying things off the web without looking them over first. With the rain train, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! At first is was skeptical, the reviews were pretty good and the price wasn't too bad, so I decided to go for it. This thing is great! The body is cast iron and very heavy. I've used it on my lawn a couple of times now and it works as advertised. I have two 100 ft hoses, one on each side of my house.  Layout the path of the ""tractor"" and let it work. I can water my 0.25 acre lot with little effort. The auto shut off works as well.

I will update my review once I've put some miles on it.

Probably the best purchase I have made off of amazon. Well worth the money. Who needs to spend thousands on a sprinkler system when this will do the same job! It's actually very soothing to watch run!!"
1.0,I haven't been able to get it to work yet.  I'll change this review when I get it to work.
5.0,I love these watering tractors.  They do a good job and save me a lot of running.
5.0,"This thing is awesome. Ready to go in less than one minute after taking it out of the box. Follows the hose, and waters the lawn for you. Shut off ramp was flawless"
4.0,"This innovative sprinkler is a great solution to large yards. The sprinkler will walk along the path of a hose and water your yard. There are two speeds of movement. The slower speed will douse your yard with about 1/2 an inch of water.

The frustrating issue with this sprinkler is that it can be difficult to see if the sprinkler is traveling along the hose because it moves so slowly. This could be solved with a marker on the back wheel of sprinkler.

I had no issues with it becoming stuck. This is probably because the sprinkler is made of high quality metal which weighs the sprinkler down.
Overall, I highly recommend this sprinkler."
5.0,"We currently have over 1,000 feet of hose around our place. The Gilmore brand have been the best. The only one we had problems with was promply replaced. Made in USA!"
2.0,"Very disappointed the hose is extremely stiff, almost impossible to coil up. The coils have a memory and will not lay flat."
3.0,"The ends are awesome, they screw in flawlessly, difficult to deform, and the lifetime warranty is nice. I purchased four different hoses. One had a bulge in the hose, and the other had a pin hole leak. I'm not sure if I received a faulty return, or there was a quality control issue, or some error in packaging/shipping process. The two hoses I kept have performed flawlessly, and I am comforted by the lifetime warranty if these issues arise later on."
5.0,"Based on my experience owning five Flexogen hoses since I purchased my house, in 1990, I cannot give a higher recommendation.  This is one product that exposed many in my family to the value of warranties.

Have I had a few replaced over the years? Yes.

I'm surprised that anyone has had the replacement problem. When there has been a failure, I've just shipped off the ends, written a letter with my return info and a description of the original length of the hose and received the replacement in the mail a while later.

Sorry to hear that anyone does not have the same experience that so many of us have had with this product. There are real Gilmour company fanatics out there. Count me as one.

PS: [comment on durability and increase durability]  I have reduced the wear and tear on my hoses over the years to only screwing the hoses into universal connector systems from the very beginning.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-9QC-Brass-Hose-Quick-Connector-Set/dp/B0008IT0GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 9QC Brass Hose Quick Connector Set</a>&nbsp;Setting this up around the house has made it much faster to hook hoses up as well as reduce the major failure mode that I have seen over the years.  It seems the action of screwing the hose to the faucet or to a variety of watering nozzles would wear out the brass threaded fittings.  It takes years of use to wear a brass end ou.  Finding pin hole leaks on the threads were irritating.  I've spent a bit more money for the convenience, but it has made the hoses last much much longer.  But if one fails again, I know that I will be able to return the ends and get a replacement."
5.0,"I always recommend this brand. They stand behind their warranty. The hoses are well built, but if you have a problem with it, and it breaks, chop off the ends, send em in and they send you a new hose. No problems. I've only had to do this once for the 3 or so hoses that I've purchased. They are well built, sturdy hoses."
5.0,"This is the third one I have gotten. If you want a great hose and a great price, buy this. If you need 2 shorter hoses, still cheaper to buy this hose, cut it in half and buy  fittings for the cut ends"
5.0,"LAST HOSE YOU WILL EVER BUY
Gilmour 10-58050 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch by 50-Foot, Green
Gilmour 10-58050 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch by 50-Foot, Green
Gilmour 10-58050 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch by 50-Foot, Green"
2.0,"The hose is ""brittle"" compared to others we have used. Yes it won't kink,but it is so stiff it's hard to move around our shop. I wouldnt recommend this hose to anyone for it's price. Yes our shop is heated also,so cold isn't playing any factor."
4.0,"I needed a short hose for the front of the house and was tired of cheap ones that leaked after one season.  This 8-ply is still a bit heavy, but at 25 feet that isn't as much of a problem. The extra rubber sleeve connector prevents leaking at the faucet and the length doesn't get in the way. Next replacement of my longer hose will probably be a Gilmour Flexogen."
4.0,This is a fine hose that meets all my expectations.  I have used it several times and am sure that it will last a long time.
5.0,Heavy duty for the price. Impressed.
5.0,Great!
4.0,Good
5.0,Good reliable brand. Tough
5.0,Excellent tool for trimming back flowers and small bushes.
1.0,"These are the worst pruning shears I have ever owned. Bought used one, they broke and bought another one. Those also broke after one use. Complete junk, stay away."
5.0,Great
5.0,"I always look for Fiskars now when buying garden tools.  Comfortable, cut easily and cleanly."
5.0,Very sharp...perfect for small jobs.
5.0,Sturdy.
5.0,These things are solid! We are going through a dry and hot spell here in MN and these things are troopers. My husband loves setting them up and letting them do all the work!
5.0,This is a heavy well built product that works exactly like it's suppose to.  Recommend it for full coverage of a large lawn.
4.0,Had this type along time ago and it works great and that is why I bought it again after my sprinkler system broke.
1.0,Broke within a season; one of the arms fell off so it won't move.
5.0,"Great for any size yard, I remember these when I was a kid.  Good watering radius and adjustable speed."
5.0,Husband loves it.  Glad we purchased it.  Very convenient to use.
3.0,"My family had one of these many years ago and it worked very well.  However, our water pressure at our current home is not great so this product does not work optimally.  Also, it has trouble keeping upright on uneven or sloped terrain.  I know this product can be effective once I level our yard with additional dirt and see about beefing up our water pressure."
5.0,"Works great, already saved my lawn!"
5.0,"I had used one of these before but with a different brand name so I basically knew what to expect. Used my Nelson Raintrain the  afternoon I got it and it has performed efficiently since. In my opinion, an excellent little machine."
5.0,The sprinkler works well.  I just wish that it would travel when the the water flow is set lower.  I have to turn the water valve at the spigot to a pretty high flow in order to keep it moving.
5.0,I really like this tool.
1.0,Bought these over a year ago and they are almost useless now. They blades have rusted terribly (kept in screened in patio) and they do not open on their own anymore. The spring in the handle that opens broke almost immediately. Cheap garbage. Do not last.
4.0,"good tool for cutting branches and vines, useful"
3.0,"Definitely sharp. Worked really well but the grip is a little weird for me. I have a hard time using one hand.
I was working on some overgrown plants and I had to grip a bunch with one hand and use the shears with the other. It was a little difficult to keep cutting without having to re- adjust my grip."
5.0,Just used it today and they worked great!
5.0,Good
4.0,"great pair of chears for small shurbs and vines. I have found that it doesn't work on anything harger that an inche in diameter if its wooden - if your muscular, that might not be the case ;)"
5.0,"Well made, stay sharp, easy on hands and comfortable to use for extended trimming!  Real 5-star shears!"
5.0,Quality tool that I love for the gardening.
5.0,Perfect for use in my greenhouse
5.0,"Have had two of these hoses for over two years with no kinks.  The quality is great and I am thinking of buying a third for my other spigot. The hose never loses pressure or cuts off due to a kink. I use one exclusively for my swimming pool and have no problem attaching it to the pool cleaner and dragging it around my 50,000 gal pool. Both hoses look like new even though both sit outside year round and one spends a considerable amount of time underwater."
5.0,"I bought this one to replace another I had for 11 years that finally gave out.  It used to be you could cut off the end of the hose and send it in for a free replacement, but now you have to fill out a form and provide proof of purchase.  I couldn't find the original paperwork so ordered another one.
Yes, if you look at the initial price, it is an expensive hose.  However you won't have to replace it every year, so in the long run, it is cheaper than buying the cheap hoses. It is a very good quality hose and should last for years.  I don't think it ""will be the last hose you ever buy"", but compared to other hoses, it will do it's job for years to come."
5.0,"Great item, it sees heavy duty use at the house and a lot of dragging over sharp rocks and concrete. Best hose I have ever bought, period!"
3.0,not nearly as flexible as I was lead to believe from the advertising.  Even now after being warmed by the sun the thing still want to coil up like a spring.  In addition the portion of the hose that attaches to the hose bib leaks unless some serious muscle is placed behind tightening it.  I will not be buying this product line again.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking. No kinks, thicker than most hoses sold in stores so the water goes through a little bit faster. Perfect long length."
3.0,"I ordered two hoses.  The box came a day late and looked like it had been through a rough journey with rips and holes.  One of the hoses had come loose from it's packaging.  On closer inspection, it looked like the box was re-used and poorly taped together from the beginning.  Haven't used the product yet, so I can't comment on that."
5.0,"As advertised, this is a fantastic, durable garden hose that resists kinking, stays pliable, and always remains easy to return to a coil. The build quality is outstanding, and I've already gotten several years of use out of it. The threaded fittings are heavy duty (by garden hose standards, anyway), and the material that the hose itself is constructed from is very tough. I wasn't thrilled with the color at first, as it's a bit different from the usual, but it quickly grew on me. With the trouble-free service this hose has given me, the thing could be florescent orange, and I would still use it!

When you consider the price I paid for this hose (just over $25 with free shipping), this is easily a five star product. I've probably bought a half dozen junk hoses that lasted a year or two. Not only were they a waste of money, but they were incredibly difficult to use (constantly kinking, leaking from fittings, etc.), compared to this one. This is a no-brainer purchase for any home owner... you might pay a small amount more, but the returns are enormous."
5.0,"We have bought many hoses over the years, but this by far the best. Only had problems with one of the eight we have bought and it was promptly replaced with no questions asked. Made in USA!"
5.0,"This hose is lightweight, flexible but well made.  It will still kink but not as much as others I've purchased and used.  I will be buying another as I have both a back yard and front and feel this is by far the best."
2.0,I bought these hoses in hopes of less kink issues than I had in other hoses.  Unfortunately this hose kinks easily as well.
5.0,This is a great sprinkler I have wanted one for years. The seller shipped very fast and it beat all my expectations. The price was great as well.
5.0,"this is a great machine.  We used it and use it during dry spells, and it is much easier than walking out every few minutes to change a sprinkler."
5.0,"works great, just like the ones my parents had when I was growing up. the only problem I've had is it tends to get bogged down if you have any bare dirt spots in the yard and it will dig the back wheels down till it tips over. Not the fault of the machine though."
5.0,this is an awesome sprinkler.  Set it at one end of your yard and it will water the whole thing - and shut itself off.  Like roomba for yard watering.
1.0,"Waste of my money and now I can't return it!!!

Just tried it this week and it's doesn't work on my property.  Only goes at Low - won't move on Medium or High speeds, floods my property on Low and takes hours to go nowhere."
5.0,Rugged design of body.  Hose connection needs care when attaching hose as it could be easily damaged. Adjustable wands allow coverage variety.  Shutoff ramp works well. I would not totally rely on auto stop/shutoff ain't did go off the hose track a couple of times due to uneven spots in lawn ( not really the device's fault). I use it while working in other areas of the yard.
5.0,quenching
5.0,"Outstanding, works great"
5.0,Just what I needed.
5.0,This is one of the best purchase/inventions I have ever seen. It works methodically along the water hose and the coverage area is awesome. This is a must have if you want irrigation but can't afford the 4k price tag.
4.0,"But for some reason they stick after you use them to cut a stem or branch.
I will try some WD-40 and see if that helps."
5.0,Very good product!
5.0,Bought these as a birthday day gift and they are a great quality tool for anyone who works in a flower or vegetable garden.
5.0,"Great shears, high quality."
5.0,Good design.  Good quality.
5.0,Perfect.  After 10+ years I wore out my old pair.  These are great.
5.0,I've had these for three years and they are still sharp and effective. Great product!
5.0,It's been a year with somewhat constant use (bi-weekly) and it's still going strong.  Well worth the money.
2.0,"These shears trim wonderful BUT I have already lost one of the grips as they were both loose when bought,sure wish there was replaceable."
5.0,Awesome! Fiskars brand is awesome!!
5.0,I purchased this Gilmour 8ply Flexogen Hose for the simple reason I have had with other hoses kinking and being difficult to roll up. I certainly have not been disappointed it is very easy to use and I now know I made the right choice. Love it.
5.0,"You know how some things look good in a picture and when you get it you are disappointed.
This will not disappoint you."
2.0,"This is one where I should have listened to the other reviewers.  I liked the idea of a premium hose made in the USA.  Unfortunately, after sitting out less than a month it started developing bubbles with pinhole leaks.  Due to the nature of the material, you can not just tape them up as with a rubber hose.  The black rubber Craftsman this replaced lasted me a good 10 years.  I should have sent this one back."
5.0,"I love that it is 5/8"" so you get a nice full flow of water and great pressure at the nozzle.  I've had mine for two years out in the central Texas sun and storms with temps from 20 - 110 degrees and they have not failed.  When frozen they harden but don't crack and when in the sun they soften, but don't crack.  If you take the time to unroll them, they lay flat and don't want to kink, which is really nice.  We use ours on and off several times a day at the barn.  I've replaced hoses annually until I tried this brand.  It is sure nice to have something stand up to the daily wear and tear at the barn.  It's outlasted all the other brands I've had, and now it is saving me money because I haven't had to replace it."
4.0,This is a nice kink free hose.  It's a little heavy but hopefully that will add to its durability.  I would definitely purchase this hose again.  Met my expectations nicely
5.0,This hose is 100 feet and it makes it halfway around my house.  A high quality hose for the price.
5.0,"Purchased this hose as a replacement for 2 shorter hoses linked together. The constant tugging and bending led to some serious leaks in the fittings. That was then. The Gilmour hose has machined brass fittings that extend up into the hose with additional strength offered by external sleeves. The hose was very stiff when I pulled it from the package, so I laid it out in large loops on the back lawn to soak in the sun. Rolled it onto the wall-mounted reel the next day with little effort. One good yank is usually sufficient to unwind all the hose I need. The hose doesn't swell when a nozzle is turned off, and haven't had a single kink to date. Definitely a good product at a good price. Thanks Amazon!"
5.0,"It's been outside in the hot (South Florida) sunshine 24/7, and still flexible. No crackles, and remains in great shape!
A real bargain!"
2.0,"Well,it was nice while it lasted, but this turned out to be a pretty cheap hose also.  As soon as the weather here in South Florida started the warm days/cool nights, this Gilmour started getting kinks all over.  I am not sure there really is a hose that won't kink; this one sure does."
2.0,"The hose is good when using in warm weather. However, when outside temperature drops to the low 50s and below, the hose is very stiff and hard to roll up or untangle. That's the only gripe I have."
4.0,Not great for areas just planting grass...gets stuck in the mud.
2.0,This would be such an awesome sprinkler if the gears lasted longer.  We spent $80 on this unit and used it for about two years.  And then we started experiencing the same issue everyone complains about... drive gears started stripping out.  A replacement set costs an additional $30.  I would spend some additional $$ if Bosch/Nelson would offer a metal gear option.  The poor gears ruins this otherwise fantastic sprinkler.  Look at different models that have a metal gear drive system.
5.0,good product
5.0,Finally was able to use it. Best investment I ever made
1.0,"I've owned 2, neither of which lasted more than 2 years.  The bottom shutoff valve is plastic and has broke on both of mine. There is no way of fixing it. I don't know if our water pressure is too high or what but it has not ever broke any other sprinkler. I wish it was completely made of metal. My yard is 18acres and these sprinklers work well covering surface, but not when I have to replace every other year!"
4.0,"I have purchased 4 of these. They seem to last more than 1 season, unlike some of their competitors. This is a great traveling sprinkler, and it saves time from always having to move the sprinkler around. You do need to follow the recommendations though. 50-75 foot of hose is about the max, but after all remember it is powered by water pressure."
5.0,Works well for watering your entire yard.  Set it up and let it go.  Very well made.
4.0,Makes watering so muck easier with better coverage. Warning - check on it from time to time because when it reaches end of travel it doesn't always stay on stop ramp. The tractor wheels will dig into your lawn. I left house a couple of times and tractor came off ramp and didn't stop  tracto. Wheels dug into lawn. Good news is when this happens and it digs it will stop watering when plunger reached. I would buy again.
5.0,LOVE this sprinkler! I've been waiting a long time for a crawler and it didn't disappoint. Excellent quality and easy to use!
3.0,"Honestly, it may work as described but I don't think it's worth the hassle of setting up the hose and wastes water unless you have a lawn that's perfectly shaped for this product."
4.0,"I love the sprayer - it works exactly as advertised.  We use the sprayer on our yard and flowers every week.  The only negative is that I would like to use different bottles for different types of uses, i.e. - fertilizer, insecticide, etc.  We have used the small coke bottles which works pretty well but would prefer to have more than one of their bottles because they work better and hold more product.  I'm not sure if the bottles are sold separately."
5.0,This is the 3rd Gilmore sprayer I have purchased. They work so well friends and family ask to borrow them. I can't say no and they like them so well they can't remember to bring them back! This is a fantastic sprayer and Amazon has the best deals on them.
5.0,The Gilmour Professional sprayer is easy to use. It sprays 25-30 feet in the air. It is easy to adjust. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0,"And I don't mean Amos. Don't get stuck with those cheap plastic hose end sprayers that last maybe if your lucky last  three applications. This baby has real brass sprayers and good old fashioned USA knowhow. For maybe seven or eight dollars more than those cheap ones you have something that lasts. (That's a rare thing these days)Treat yourself right, so long for now Retired Early"
5.0,"I spray castor oil around my yard with this thing to keep the moles away, it's so much better than lugging a 5 gallon tank of diluted chemical around.
Things I like: Good quality metal sprayer, mixing head and nozzle, comfortable grip, good quality plastic payload reservoir with ounces and milliliter marks for easy measuring, sprays a jet stream of mixed fluid for 30 feet or wider area up to about 5 feet. It's fully adjustable, you can spray 1-10 tablespoons per gallon of water or 1-10 teaspoons. Spare parts are available from the manufacturer, nice to know you don't have to throw the whole thing away when an O-ring or spring breaks.
Things I don't like: Plastic adjuster dial is hard to adjust, if you set it down in which case it will certainly fall over, fluid leaks out the air vent at the top. The plastic part on the tip that gives you a choice of narrow stream or wide pattern seems rather cheap, and eventually will fall off and get lost. There's really not much spray pattern adjustment other than that."
4.0,"After making the mistake of buying a cheapo plastic version at our local hardware store, I bought this one. No leaks, easy to use, brass fittings, this is the one to get."
5.0,"The Sprayer worked great for a week or so then I noticed the liquid Fertilizer was not going down in the bottle very much.  So I gave it a test and dialed the highest level and sprayed it for a good while. The liquid went down none.  I took the sprayer a part and cleaned it real well.  It was pluged up.  I then read the read instructions and it told me to clean it well after each usage.  I cleaned it and it work perfectly.  I then started cleaning it every time I use it and it works well.  Here is how I clean it. I filled a 2 gallon bucket with water and now every time I use the sprayer when I am finished I unscrew the bottle and stick the entire sprayer in the water and turn it on and it cleans it real well.

This might help in cleaning the sprayer. Thanks, Wally Colson"
5.0,"I've used such sprayer since I was 15, now 67. There's none other to consider.

5.0,Fiskars is my choice brand for gardening supplies. im always satisfied with the brand.
5.0,Very good.
5.0,Love 'me so far!
4.0,very nice I'll be using them soon.
3.0,Don't care for the sheets fabric. Guess I am a dyed in the wool cotton sheets guy. The sheets are nice and the seller performed very nicely. My mistake for trying a new sheet material at my age.
5.0,helps me in the garden
5.0,Easy to operate and provides a clean cut.
2.0,They are sharp but so flawed. They don't reopen by themselves. You snip a stem and they stay closed. You can't really use them just one handed...
5.0,I love these! I bought a second one for my daughter!
5.0,I love these pruners.  Work really good.
5.0,"I like the hose.  It is easy to use, drag around and does not kink like other hoses do.  Would purchase again."
5.0,"I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks"
4.0,"i have only used this hose once. It does not kink. It has very good hose connector ends.
I may purchase a 50 foot hose to replace some of our older hoses."
5.0,This hose lives up to its word. Soft and flexible and easy to use. It joins a previous Flexogen hose we purchased years ago and still have and use. This time we needed a longer one and hope to get the same great wear as with our first purchase.
5.0,Have used this hose for about a month now.  Performs as expected with tight-sealing brass fittings.  No kinks.  This is the best garden hose I could find and it should last several seasons at this price.
1.0,"After a few weeks of household use, the outer layer looks like a python that's eaten several chickens. Now it's leaking! Past return to Amazon so back to Gilmour it goes. I need the hose to water my plants so I need to buy another and when this one is replaced I guess I'll put it on Craiglist for whatever I can get. Don't waste you time and money."
3.0,"It is true that it won't kink, but the trade off is the weight...it is very heavy and difficult to move it around.  That said, the build is quite solid and works as advertised."
5.0,"I bought the 50 foot 5/8 flexogen after using several other brand name hoses. Flexogen exceeded my expectations.  Although it was 50 feet long, it was light to carry, flexible, great pressure and very easy to coil.  No kinking problems whatsoever. I would certainly recommend it."
5.0,This is one of the finest hoses I have ever owned. Handles large volumes of water over the entire 250 ft of hoses I use. Much lighter than the rubber ones I used to use and less likely to kink wnen under pressure.
5.0,The hoses are great and you can't beat the warranty. You only need to send the ends in and a new replacement hose is on the way. Be sure to get the 8 ply flexogen hose . No problems. I've seen some reviews that were negative but my guess is they went for the cheaper hose by the same name but not the 8 ply. The Amazon price was half of retail- what a buy.
4.0,"Finished year two and it is still going strong, just have to watch the small hills in the yard - can fall off the tracks with too much of an down slope."
5.0,good coverage
4.0,"Its a labor intensive job to set this sprinkler up in your yard.  Lots of garden hose placement is necessary but once done it gets the job of watering the lawn done in an easy fashion.  Its a well build, heavy duty, unit."
5.0,Pretty stinkin-neat.  Enough said.
5.0,i love it
5.0,"<div id=""video-block-RFF9DFDADJY4G"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1dcxIY88LS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1MIvlnb%2BAS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;&nbsp;I use a bigger style of this for work ""3inch hose rain train"" and figured I would look for something smaller for home use.  I'm glad I look because this thing works amazingly.  I was very skeptical at first when I saw the ""studded"" tires but the worry was all for not.  The selectable speed works great and easily adjusts for distance of watering. I have tried the neutral position for focused watering but I do like the travelling mode setting.  I used this on a new lawn where hay, seed mix, and clay/loam was installed just hours before.  As long as your not lazy about adjusting your hose path before turning it on, then this will be your very best friend for watering.  The stopper works great at the end of the run so the water automatically shuts down when it reaches the end of the road."
1.0,"MY gears went out twice in the summer. I have a decent size yard, we have a .25 acre lot our house sits on."
2.0,"Have another new one of these and one about 10 years old, they work better than this one, neither one of them turns themselves off, repeatedly, in the middle of watering. I complained to the seller, who referred me to Amazon, who, unlike their usual great customer service, disappointed us when they failed to respond. Husband thinks there is a defect in the shut off switch & it constantly cuts off as it rolls along it's path down the hose. I think we got a bad apple, we love the other 2 that we have."
5.0,Built well - kids will love this thing!
4.0,"Works good. Like the easy adjustable rotating water arms for distance and speed.  Auto shut off sticks closed sometimes.  Love how it follows the pre-laid hose, just wish it had a track you could lay out so you didn't have to drag the hose all over the yard and reset hose path each and every time you want to use it.  Would love to be able to install a track and place on a timer."
2.0,seriously overpriced.
1.0,"It does NOT spray water far enough or wide enough, very disappointed. Also it's too pricey."
4.0,"Leaks a bit around both the nozzle and the hose connector. We used them (we bought two) to spray Bifen concentrate over about an acre of yard with a standard garden hose. The bottles were easy to fill up, attach to the hose, and set the dial (we needed to do some math to determine which dial setting to use, but once that was figured out, it was a breeze. The math step was more about poor conversation and ratio information on the Bifen bottle, not so much due to this product). Adjusting the angle and arch of the water stream is very easy by twisting or removing the small black piece on the nozzle. Based on the amount of yard we sprayed compared to how much area we should have been able to cover according to the Bifen instructions, these hose end sprayers seemed to dilute the concentrated liquid effectively and accurately because we ended right on par. My only complaint was the constant dripping of partially diluted concentrate onto my hands and arms. Otherwise it's a nice simple and effective product. I'd recommend these sprayers and I'd buy again if I end up needing another."
5.0,Works great!
5.0,Absolutely the best ever for applying chemicals to the lawn.
5.0,"Good product for spraying insecticide on my spruce trees.  The pump up sprayers required mixing and simply didn't enough liquid up into the tree branches.  And the hose end sprayer that I purchased from the local box store just didn't get up high enough. The Gilmour 362 shoots a stream nearly 30 feet.  Unfortunately, my trees are 35 feet tall.  But I think if I stand on a ladder the nest time I spray the trees, I should be able to get clear to the top!"
3.0,Bought one about 5 years ago. After <year the red tab that holds the lever onto the valve popped off. It was a pressure fit piece of plastic on a black plastic piece connected to the nozzle that the lever pulled onto. Had to drill a hole and stick a finish nail in it to hold in place. The pick shows it in there and rusty after four years. I would not trust this for really precise measurements but it does work with gradations fairly well.
5.0,Good sprayer - solid and would buy again
1.0,"I bought the Gilmour last year. Used it once. Went to use it this morning and found a third of the lettering and indicators gone. All the sprayer has been used for is 1 dose of Malathion. Stored on a shelf in the garage.

Unless you have the ability to memorize all the markings and directions on the bottle, take a pass."
4.0,As expected.
5.0,"I was tired of those ""no-kink"" hoses kinking on me after a year or two. I did a bunch of research about hose construction and finally ponied up the cash for one of these. After using it for a while, I quickly bought two more so that these are the only hoses I have around the house now. They work incredibly well!"
3.0,I bought two of these hoses a couple of months ago.  I store them outside on a covered hose reel during the watering season and use them about 3 times per week.  They haven't kinked or cracked yet.  But they started to flatten into an oval shape.  I probably wouldn't have purchased these if I had seen them in person first.  They just don't look like high quality hoses.  But only time will tell how good they really are.
5.0,"I've used these hoses for years, had one at my previous house for 10 years, used it to water the back yard from four different locations every 5 days all spring & summer in Dallas heat.  I left it at the house because it was 100' and my next home didn't need such a long one. Bought a new one off Amazon and the price is amazing - like $90+ at Lowes, less than half that price on Amazon.

The hose will arrive a bit stiff and coiled, and may seem tangled - don't let it worry you, just stretch is out to full length, get the twists out of it, and re-coil it - good to go!"
5.0,"My wife and I were getting fed up with our hose kinking everytime we used it and it was also difficult to roll up due to it wanting to keep it's original rolled up shape.  I had seen the Flexogen 50 foot hose at a local nursery, but the price was $57.00!!!  No way, Jose! I checked on good old Amazon and there it was for about half that price with free shipping.  Amazon.com usually has what we are looking for at a great price and it seems most of the time, what we purchase, has free shipping.  Anyway, this hose is of excellent quality without being heavy, has good end fittings, is supple to handle and rolls up easily without kinking at all.  Maybe if I were to order this hose again I would select the 75 foot length.  Overall, a VERY nice hose of fine quality.  AMAZON prices are TOPS!!"
5.0,The hose was as described and received in a timely fashion.  I am using the hose with the Suncast Hose Reel and it is a perfect match.  This hose is well made with minimal kinking.  I would recommend it to others.
5.0,This hose is built and looks sturdy. Doesn't kink. High quality construction. Probably buy another one for the front yard.  Highly recommend!!!
1.0,"I bought this last spring intending to use it right away, but got delayed and only just started to use it.  Well it leaks badly at one of the conectors where it joins the hose.  Also the hose is very stiff and hard to straighen (and it's a much hotter than normal right now).  It hasn't kinked on me yet: a plus.  Too bad they didn't bother to test it before sending it to Amazon.  If I was still in the return period I'd just send it back.  I guess I could contact the manufacturer and see if they'd replace it but it's a hassle as the nearest post office is a long ways away from me and returning the hose end would cost as much as a repair part, so I'm here to find a repair kit for a brand new hose.  If you intend to test it right away you can always return it but don't delay like I did.  I will look for a different brand next time."
5.0,"I've owned several garden hoses of various brands and on my contractor's recommendation got this one - 100ft - for the yard.  Best hose ever.  Never kinks, never folds, durable, very happy with it."
5.0,Just what we needed. This is a very durable and kink free hose that works great in our yard. I would definetly purchase another of these if needed.
5.0,I've been using this hose around the yard for a over a month and it is the best hose I have ever owned. Anytime a kink tries to form it just un-kinks itself. Its a very durable hose so I recommend getting a hose reel/ hose cart so you can easily manage it.
5.0,These are  fine clippers.  The padded handles eliminates any slippage.  The clippers cut easily without  needing  large hands  or needing superior strength.to make the cut.
5.0,Good price...
5.0,Perfect for pruning! Love the safety lock feature!
5.0,"It works great, I use it to clip small plants."
5.0,You've used these your whole life for a reason. They're still that good.
5.0,"Made well, use them all the time."
5.0,very sharp
5.0,Really good clippers. Thanks!
5.0,Excellent
5.0,Seem to be very sharp and have worked for me so far. I guess only time will tell how they hold up over time and more use.
5.0,Great sprinkler.  Works as advertised.
5.0,I have two Raintrains and they are awesome.
1.0,broke at the 3rd day of use
5.0,This sprinkler does exactly what it you want it to do. I think I could watch it crawl across the yard all day.  I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0,The Nelson Raintrain works perfectly and as advertised. Great product !
5.0,Works great! I love that it shuts off at a predetermined spot.
5.0,"I tried to use this on a new lawn and it gets stuck in the mud and won't travel. That was my fault for not researching this style of sprinkler. I still love it though, it's very heavy and seems to be well built and believe it will work great once my lawn gets established."
5.0,Great Item. I love this sprinkler. works great even up and down hills.
5.0,The best.  Has saved me much time moving the hose and covering a large lawn without built ins.
2.0,Had a small spot in my hose where i had cut it and repaired...this made the unit go too slow. Took 4 hours to go just 50 ft.
5.0,I LOVE THIS THING.  I PRESSURE WASHED MY HOUSE WITH IT.
5.0,I have had a number of hose-end sprayers over the years and this is by far the best one I have used (have used it now for 7 seasons).  I have pump sprayers and an ATV mounted electric sprayer.  The pump sprayers are good for spot treatment and the ATV sprayer is good for times when you don't have to worry about overspray (spraying for mosquitos).  The Gilmour is my choice for treating lawn weeds.
2.0,First one was defective and the second one isn't much better. It leaks really bad and seems to stop up often.
5.0,"Purchased several years ago for ~ $25.  It is a huge time saver over the self-carried, multi-gallon, hand-pump pressurized sprayers.  Half of the product is plastic, so to avoid damage, it must be handled with care when loading the product concentrate, assembling, disassembling, or storing.  Must be flushed with water after each use.  Intake tube has a fine-mesh screen, so any granular product MUST be thoroughly dissolved prior to spraying.
If buying today, I would purchase the Chapin G362 instead - looks like the same thing, but at a much lower price.."
5.0,I use this to spray chlorine on the overhead screen of our pool cage. Works great. Wish the bottle would hold more since we have the unit set for maximum distribution and it needs to be refilled often. But it is what the manufacturer says it is so who am I to complain. Good product.
5.0,Works well.
2.0,eeh.
5.0,It works great to spray weed killer on a big vacant lot I own.
5.0,"Works very well.  To clean the green algae growth from my white aluminum  siding,  I fill the bottle with bleach and spray the siding with a hose.  Works better than high pressure water .  The algae disappears immediately."
5.0,"Of all the sprayers that are out there, this one is the very best. Do not buy the Ortho brand,  as they are not high-quality. This version built by Gilmour  cannot be beat"
5.0,"Has saved us so much time and hassle! You need to experiment where to put your garden hose so the lawn gets covered at one time, but after you figure that out, watering is a breeze! So gratefu! Happy husband, happy home!"
5.0,"Works great. It covers my front and back lawn with no issues. A few times it's become stuck in loose soil but we were using it on a new lawn. I've had my other one for 25 years. I had lost the self turning off part, after calling them they sent me one for no charge. What more can you ask of a company."
4.0,This looks like it will work great next season.  Not good for new seed but looks great for established lawn.  You do need a lot of hose and good water pressure for best performance.
5.0,This product is amazing. We  are reseeding our lawn and the Traveling Sprinkler is almost as good as an inground system. The only problem we have encountered is having to pull some of the hose closer to the unit to prevent the hose weight from stopping it .... we are using over 150 ft.  of hose. It works on uneven surfaces and large areas...highly recommend for large areas and regular watering needs.
5.0,absolutely love how this rolls along
5.0,"I bought this to help in manually watering my 1 acre lot.  I have an island with pine trees in the middle of the front yard, and a large, landscaped pool area in the middle of the back.  Watering this with convention spike sprinklers was an all-day affair of moving the sprinklers every 15-20 mins.  Now, I can do the front with just two placements of the front hose, and in the rear I can place my three hoses in a pattern around the pool and only have to move it twice.  Instructions says it's not intended for newly seeded grass but it seems to work beautifully with over-seeding and patching.  One tip: when you first start it, always watch long enough to ensure that it's actually moving.  It's easy to forget to put it in gear when moving.  I'm going to put some red paint or something on a couple of the wheel spikes to make it easier to see movement.  Oh, it also says it's not for slopes but as long as you start at the top and let it travel down, it works just fine.  Probably won't climb a hill though."
5.0,Works good saves time having to move sprinkler around.
4.0,"Tractor works as it should.  I have hilly ground, so what I did was take the wheels off of the old tractor and put them on the wheel of the new tractor.  Now I have not had one tip over since I did this."
5.0,This was bought as a gift for my mother because I love mine!
5.0,"My family had this sprinkler when I was a child in the 60's, and since I don't have an irrigation system, I decided to give it a try.  Fabulous product.  Set it and forget it and it waters a large area without any attention being paid.  Love it."
5.0,"This is a very nice well made hose that you wouldn't normally find in a Retail Store.  This thing is going to last for many years to come.

I purchased (2) 100' hoses.  My wife didn't turn the water faucet off and the temperature went up to 105-106 degrees for 2-days.  The things didn't split open and they retained their shape."
5.0,"Best hose I've bought todate.  Glossy coating helps it glide and slide though the grass.  The finish also keeps it from getting spotty and discolored from dirt, mold and general outdoors weathering.  Just the right amount of stiffness to prevent kinking.  Any kinks that might occur (rare at best) are easily shaken out from a distance. Two thumbs UP."
1.0,"I didn't use the hose very much at first so the problems with it didn't become evident until now (2 months later and too late to return it). With the hose under pressure, the layers (plys) come apart and stop up the hose from inside. I've had to cut off the top 10-15 feet and put a new end on it. Now another section below that is breaking down. This is a very poorly made hose.

*Update: a year+ later and more of the hose has had to be cut out. Worthless garbage - this is not a good hose. I am now looking for a solid rubber, heavy duty hose to do the job this hose should have done."
5.0,"This hose is exactly as described. It's well made, strong, and flexible. Due to its eight ply construction, it is heavier than any other hose I have owned and does not kink. If it fails soon, I'm sure my rating will drop. And since I never leave pressure on it for longer than a few minutes, I don't expect it to split."
5.0,Excellent product! I would recommend to any one for purchase. Nicely made and proud of the Made in the USA label. Now we await to see that this product had a life of longevity. Other than that I am very pleased.
5.0,"Purchased this hose for length and quality. Very pleased with it and non kinking. Next on my list is a 100' 3/4""  Gilmore hose of the same type.  Water runs off pump and the larger diameter gives me more flow. Warrantee is great also!"
2.0,"I needed a new hose for the pit I dug in the basement.  Of course the first place I went was Amazon.  I also needed lotion, and basket, a length of rope and other various leather tools.  The hose was incapable of reaching the pit!!!  No matter how hard I pulled, it wouldn't reach.  Eventually, I pulled too hard and the plumbing ruptured filling the pit and drowning it's inhabitant.  Oh well, you have to break a few eggs to make an omlet."
3.0,"After fighting with stiff cheap hoses, I was really looking forward to this one. It wasn't cheap.
 It ISN'T flexible. Still have the same issue as with the cheap hose, very stiff and hard to roll up.
I don't recommend it."
5.0,Great Hose. It doesn't kink and is a nice heavy duty rubber. I just wish I got the 50' hose instead of the 25'
5.0,"This hose is one killer hose.  It is just like the other one I have.  But newer, of course.  Well, see ya!"
1.0,"No need to purchase this expensive outdated sprayer. I returned mine after getting soaked when using it. A year ago Chapin bought the Gilmour sprayer line, re-engineered them and you can purchase an improved sprayer for $19.00. I bought a Chapin and I'll give 5 stars for quality."
5.0,Its a garden sprayer what can you really say
5.0,It works
5.0,Works great.
5.0,Works perfect. Feels like it will last a long time.
1.0,This product never worked. I would not call it a professional grade product.
4.0,"I've discovered a pneumatic sprayer is still better for some applications but this a great universal use sprayer for plant food and some chemicals.  Even can be used for soap and antiseptic application.  My garden is in a different spot now and I get less use out of it.  But it always works, unlike the dispenser Scotts sells with their WS plant food.  I usually mix solid substances with a bit of water and adjust the mix accordingly. Handy for applying Epsom salt, as well."
3.0,I don't know how to use it .
5.0,"Very well-designed. Works very well for what I need (Zn fertilizer applications). From the details on this site, I couldn't tell if it came with the metal sprayer, or just the bottle attachment. Comes with both."
1.0,"I felt it important that I warn the public against buying this product. I know it's hard to believe in this day and age, since we have such ability in manufacturing, but it is a fact: this sprayer has become notorious in the field for being defective, right out of the box. The coarse threads that secure the top valve assembly with the reservoir bottle do not mate. Can you believe that a company could possibly release such a thing for retail sale? Once you take the reservoir bottle off and fill it with the concentrate to be sprayed, you can't get the valve assembly to screw together and seal. This means that while you're spraying, you can leak the chemical concentrate all over the place, or even have the two sections separate and fall apart in the middle of your work.

I know. It's hard to believe.

The originator of this design was Gilmour, and it was a well-known product in the landscape trades and for the homeowner, for spraying that required a longer throw of the solution than is possible with an ordinary tank sprayer (such as into a tree canopy). The brass proportioner valve has two sets of valving ranges to cover a wide range of dilution rates, and it's clever, and solidly made.

Somehow, Gilmour messed up this marvelous tool completely, by neglecting the simplest bit of the design: the threading.  And the sprayer now appears in three different brand names: Gilmour, Hudson, and Chapin- all identical in design, as far as I know.

This sort of thing really gets my goat, you know? As someone who's worked in horticulture for a very long time, it's beyond disappointing to find this sort of carelessness in a product.

There are tons of trashy spraying products now flooding the shelves of the major retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's. Do yourself a favor and locate a professional sprayer here on Amazon or elsewhere, and stay away from the cheap sprayers. There are very well-made professional sprayers available for around $165. They're probably worth it, just to avoid the aggravation...."
5.0,good
5.0,Very good quality.  Comfortable handle and cuts nearly everything that I have needed to cut for a mid-summer clean up/shape up.
5.0,Very sharp and easy to use.
5.0,Works great.
5.0,working great so far
3.0,You only get what you pay for. Use them and if you lose them ......get anther
3.0,Quality seems lower than the Loppers.  Have hardly used them but seem like they need to be sharpened - every once in a while a stem will not cut but turn vertical between blades.  After more research found that you can get shears in gardening tool kits for a much better value on Amazon.  Wouldn't buy this product again off Amazon.
1.0,Nice pruners but when I got them they looked used  and the package looked like someone else had open It very dissapointed!!!!
5.0,Fiskars only makes the highest quality products.  These pruning shears are more proof of that.  I've seen Fiskars used by gardeners at Longwood...I think that's a pretty solid endorsement.  I've used Fiskars in the yard for years.
1.0,Broken in 1 week. Poor design.
5.0,Well made tool that also works very well
5.0,Works very well.
5.0,"Works great, long range cast. You can tell everything on it is well made. EXACTLY what you need for self treatment of your lawn."
5.0,Works great. Easy to adjust and use.
5.0,Great item - shoots spray a great distance - use for fruit tree spraying.  Love it.
4.0,great
5.0,"I purchased this to spray weed killer and grass feed concentrate on my lawn and it has worked really well.  I like how you can adjust how strong of a mixture you want.  I have used it several times and I haven't experienced any problems.  As long as you clean it after each use, which is really easy, it should last for a long time."
4.0,"Excellent performer.  4 stars only because you can't find it any longer!  Would I buy again?  Yes, in a heartbeat!"
1.0,"Doesn't mix well, I used it with soap to wash car but did not like it"
5.0,This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
1.0,"Worked great the first four times I used it.  Then the cut-off switch suddenly stopped working.  Come on guys, this thing should be designed and built to work reliably.  I regret this purchase."
5.0,Very good sprinkler
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this product. A friend of mine has one and was moderately pleased with the results so I bought one too. I have a corner lot so I thought it would be good at steering itself around the lawn.

I never did get it to work. The wheels remain permanently locked and it just sits on top of the hose and won't move. Not very useful.

It was a complete waste of money."
5.0,"Love this product.  Love.  It.  I have a really irregular yard and used to have to position my sprinkler in 3 places just for the front and side. Then 2 places in the back yard. With this little gem, I ran the hose through the yard - with a bend to cover the 45 turn, no less. It works perfectly.  It's also pretty ingenious how you can adjust the arms for wider or tighter areas."
5.0,As expected!  Came fast and efficient.
5.0,I've have one myself. Gifted this one to my dad. He loves it. Has even bought longer hose to cover more area of his yard...
5.0,"Works great, set it up and leave and automatically shuts down when reaches the end"
3.0,"I've had a few issues with this tipping over. We have an awkward area we need to water and setting the hose back up every time is still annoying, but better than the alternative"
5.0,"Great product and works exceptionally well! This is my third Raintrain  in 10 years. My only slight disappointment is that they removed the slot on the top front that previous products had, and its a little more difficult to carry around."
5.0,Great sprinkler.  Takes some time to learn the best way to route hose but once you get the hang of it you'll be glad you have it.
1.0,"It is not stated anywhere that I could find on the Amazon prduct page, however once I received the hose I found the following Warning on the back of the product packaging:

""!WARNING"" This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.

Who would think they would have to wash their hands after watering the garden. What if one of the kids sneaks a drink from the hose? The manufacturer does not say what chemicals are used, nor give the consumer the information to make an informed decision. Based upon the prop65 warning and additional hand washing warning I will not use this product as the risk is unknown.

In the end I returned the hose, but am really ticked off that a Made In America product is such junk, I found in my local hardware store several different brand hoses without this warning."
1.0,"I bought this hose based on stellar reviews. Used the hose for about 30 minutes yesterday and this afternoon found the hose bloated and swelled in four places. It is about to burst. I have no idea how this happened, or how it could have occurred given its limited use yesterday. It was stored properly in a hose reel. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to return it. Disappointing."
5.0,I have already used this hose and I have to say I love the color and the durablity!!!!  Doesn't leak at all like the cheap one I bought and took back to Wally World!
1.0,"I am writing this review to try and spare a few other online shoppers the experience of trying to find a flexible hose that will wind up on your cart reel without having to be an athlete. This hose is stiff. It is best suited in my opinion for commercial use. The wife gave up trying to wind this hose up on our new $120.00 all aluminum reel(would not even attempt to windup on plastic reel) and leaves it to me. I have a 20+ yr old Swan Soft & Supple(the new Swan S&S is not even the same, read reviews)that I finally repaired(ran over the end with car)that has absolutely no problem what so ever in winding back on the reel. The wife is happy. I am happy. I would send this hose back but shipping kills that idea. I will try and sell this hose locally at a garage sale for a loss."
5.0,Over the years I've become accustomed to kinks and leaks. The difference between this Gilmour brand and every other hose I've ever used is night and day. I will never use any other brand. Great product!
5.0,"What can I say -- it's just a hose.  It's well constructed and sturdy, but not so heavy that it's too hard to drag around the yard, even when I've got the full 100' pulled out."
1.0,"I bought this at Lowes.  I looked through a bunch of them in order to find one that hadn't been severely kinked during packaging (just as comments here indicated about their ""kink free"" hose).  Got it home, and have used it twice...and simply cannot believe how badly it kinks...right by the spigot (w/ little pull on it!), and everywhere.

Also, I hooked it up as the feed for a pressure washer...and it's male connector was too short (and the nut end of it too big) for the pressure washer connector...so it leaked badly.

It's going back, and I'll buy something from another manufacturer."
3.0,"This is a sturdy hose, but not for gardens. Gilmour hoses contain lead. My husband purchased one of these. I read the label (writing is on the back of the one we got) and it carries a warning about lead."
5.0,The Gilmour hose is terrific.  It never forms kinks and is easy to coil on a hose holder when done watering.  The smooth surface does not get dirty and feels nice on your hands.  I have had one for two years and it looks brand new.  I am hoping to get years of service.  I now have 4 Gilmour hoses around the outside of my house.  The price from Amazon is much lower than the price at our local nursery stores.  Great value.
5.0,"Got it quick and it works like a charm.  It's very plyable and doesn't seem to twist so the
kinking is slim to none.  I would recomend it and would buy it again."
5.0,Fiskars never disappoints!
5.0,"Sturdy, work well and reliable."
5.0,They are great for pruning
5.0,Great quality. Perfect for our garden.
5.0,REALLY LIKE THESE TRIMMERS.
5.0,"Sharp as the dickens, so be careful not to prune a fingertip!"
2.0,"Within 10 minutes of use, the rivet that holds the return spring inside the handle failed so it doesn't spring back in your hand. Very annoying."
5.0,Works great.
5.0,"THE EASE OF PRUNING /CUTTING WITH THESE FISKARS IS UNMATCHED. THERE IS NO EFFORT ON MY HAND WHEN I HAVE USED THIS SUPER SHARP TOOLTO CUT/TRM TOUGH BRANCHES. I DO PLAN ON TAKING GREAT CARE OF IT [KEEPING IT CLEAN AND GREASED AFTER SUBSEQUENT USE],SO I CAN GET GOOD SERVICE WITH IT."
3.0,"Make sure you cut square to the branch. Cutting small (1/4""-3/8"")  limbs at a slight angle and these want to bend the blades apart. Just a little too flimsy for my liking. Work fine on the lighter stuff, just easy to overload them. I don't expect them to last more than a season."
3.0,Didn't last very long. Wouldn't bug again.
5.0,"Does what I want it to --> Kills wasps.

My front porch was getting overrun by wasps. The canisters of wasp spray were expensive, and I didn't want to spray a bunch of chemicals around where my family was going to be sitting and playing.

I fill the canister 1/3 the way with dish soap, then 2/3 the way with water.  I tweak the dial so it is pretty soapy stuff coming out of the sprayer. When I feel up for the fight, I sit on the porch, usually in the heat, with a cold beer.  When I see a wasp, the adrenaline kicks in, I point the nozzle, pull back, and try to disable the enemy before it can reach me. Sometimes, it gets pretty close, but I haven't lost a battle yet.

I have watched a few times after the wasps are sprayed, and they die.  I wanted to make sure they didn't just get wet, dry out, then live to fight another day.  The bees around don't seem to bother us, so I haven't use this on them, so don't know if it would work the same.

Tip: Make sure the hose is on before you start spraying. Otherwise, you just piss off the wasp."
4.0,Ok for small jobs
5.0,Love it. It was hard to find.
5.0,"I bought this to replace our Miracle Gro sprayer, because with Miracle Gro, you never know what the solution of water to food you're spraying on your plants.  This sprayer enables consistent fertilizer delivery.  It's high quality, easy to use."
4.0,"I USE THIS FOR WEED SPRAY. HAVE ANOTHER ONE FOR INSECTICIDE AND FERTILIZERS . BEATS HAVING SPACE WASTING,  BIG,  BULKY, PUMP UP, PRESSURE SPRAYER"
5.0,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS SPRAYER
5.0,Best sprayer out there and durable.  Stay away form those all plastic junk sprayers.
4.0,it works well and light weight.
5.0,Works well - empty the content. You have to tighten it well to prevent it from rotating when you motion it left-right.
5.0,This is second one i've purchased in 15 years.  love ittttt!
5.0,I bought one and then my neighbor did too! These things are awesome!
5.0,"Works great!!!!  Once you figure out which direction to put the watering tines...  So, I set it up and thought it was pretty easy but no matter how long I left the water running, it did NOT move!  And the rear wheels do NOT move if you try to do move them manually.  I was convince I received a lemon.  One call to support cleared it up!  Turns out you MUST turn the tines so they spin in one particular direction.  (It was in the directions AND there is a picture on the unit, but I'm a guy... so directions, shmirections!)

Long story short, my tines were spinning in the WRONG direction.  Once I turned them, it worked great!  Saves you thousands over installing an underground sprinkler system and I'd argue, it probably covers more ground!"
5.0,Works great. Has an even spread and pulls a lot of hose. I have 1 1/2 acres that I have to water occasionally during dry spells. I can set this and forget it for several hours. Very heavy and seems very sturdy.
3.0,"I received the 50970  with the Rezimar body rather than the advertised 1865 with cast iron body.  Maybe it works just as well as the cast iron version; maybe its even better.  However, the ad misrepresents the product.  So far, it seems to be propelling itself across my backyard without a problem.  I had been using my neighbor's unit with the cast iron body, and it worked great.  I only gave it three stars, because the product I received is not what was advertised."
5.0,we have had these sprinklers before and really like them.
3.0,Bought this as a replacement for my cast iron model from the 1970s.  It is superior to that one except the mechanism to shut it of automatically (a button on the underside that drags on the hose ramp shown) often shuts off prematurely on the hose.  I suspect the thickness of my St Augustine grass emphasizes the problem.
5.0,my yard lovs it
5.0,Have three and work perfect love them
5.0,best sprinkler ever. set it and walk away. 100 ft and 3 hours later it is done and turned it self off.
4.0,"I am utilizing this in a commercial application: I use it to spray a 100 part per million bleach / water solution for sanitation. The dial doesn't work in this particular scenario, so I had to play around a bit and figure out my proportions, but that's not the products fault. I have been using this for about a month and it has worked great so far. My only issue at this point is that the ""brass"" components are showing signs of oxidization and corrosion. It hasn't impacted the unit yet, but I figure that with the vessel being filled with 90% water and 10% bleach, the water shouldn't be ""rusting"" the metal."
5.0,"I bought this a few years ago when I started doing my own lawn care again. I got tired of paying a company to pretend to put products in my yard and leave a sign. I use it for chelated iron, nitrogen, cross check insecticide, and fungicide. I've yet to have any issues with it. It has got to be the best hose sprayer on the market. I've actually tested the accuracy with a bucket and find the tablespoons per gallon to be spot on when using water to test with. I would assume it would do just as well with actual products.

If I have one complaint is that it does not stand up without tipping very easily but I can't think of one I owned that didn't have that same issue."
5.0,Works great.
5.0,"The product I was sent was a no-name knock off, but it was the same product, just relabled so all was good.  No worries, that company no longer has their knock offs on this listing.  This works well from the few times I've used it, and does NOT mix water into the container to spray, it uses a venturi style suction to pull the fluid out, so when you are finished you can return the rest of the product into the original container without contaminating it or diluting it.  I don't recall the name of the merchant that sold me the knock off, but I have to give them five stars as well because as soon as I pointed out the issue they refunded my money 100% and told me to keep the sprayer and removed their listing so I cannot knock them but so much.

The deflector tip that changes the spray from a thin stream to a flat fan spray is difficult to get off the tip, but works well.  Just be SURE to keep this and the reducing brass tip somewhere you won't lose them because I doubt spares are easily obtained.

The bottle and metal spray handle are one piece."
5.0,"OUTSTANDING.  I NEED TO SPRAY THE TREES IN MY YARD, AND THIS WORKS GREAT.  I PUT THE ""BUG KILLER"" IN THE CONTAINER, ATTACH THE HOSE, TURN IT ON AND ""FIRE AWAY"".  IT HAS A DIRECT STREAM OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET.  ITS JUST WHAT I NEED."
5.0,"Easy to use and clear instructions on mix ratio. Works well, we are happy."
5.0,"This is just what I was looking for to clean the side of the house with bleach.  You have to open the spray inside hole,
with a very small drill bite.  Thank you Gary"
3.0,Only good more small amounts :-/
5.0,Best ever!
5.0,Wonderful product! Works exactly as expected and needed! Quick shipping aswell.
5.0,"Great product.  I had one before and used it for a number of years until the place where you connect the water hose to became loose and eventually broke off.
Hopefully this one last longer.
My old one lasted maybe four years of usage at perhaps once a week.."
5.0,It's the best traveling sprinkler. Extremely strong!
5.0,"We've had 2 Nelson traveling sprinklers for 25 years.  Love them. We have a large area to water, and have just never put in a sprinkler system, and luckily with the Nelson sprinklers, they allow us to water with a minimum of effort."
5.0,Sturdy construction and good water mechanism
1.0,"The auto shut off button got stuck after only using it a few times.  Unfortunately, we did not get it returned within the allowed thirty days.  If others have had good luck, maybe we just got a bad unit.  Purchasing it may be an expensive gamble.  My husband was able to get it to work but we now have no auto shut off.  Not happy for the money we spent."
5.0,Works as advertised.  Only problem:  can't use on newly seeded lawn.  Will tear it up.  Keep this in mind.
5.0,These are really cool...we have bought some from the 70's that still work!!
5.0,Love the tractor. Just need a light hose or only one length as the weight can slow or stop it.
2.0,Plastic internal gears strip and leave sprinkler dead on the lawn
4.0,ALL I GOT WAS THE MOTOR.  EASY TO REPLACE AND NOW WORKS LIKE WHEN IT WAS NEW.
1.0,"If you want a good hose, made in the usa, and very tough, get this one: Made in Oregon (waterrightinc dot com) best hose I have ever used. Small diameter but it still seems to flow very well."
5.0,I added an additional 25 foot section of the Flexogen hose to my existing 60 feet. Both are trouble free and operate as advertised. Connection is leak free as well. Great product.
2.0,"I bought this to replace a hose that was a bit too short.  This hose worked adequately during the first year of use, but since then it kinks like crazy.  My blood pressure can't take the aggravation - I'm going back to my old hose."
5.0,"Excellent hose.  These are the best hose I ever used.  These are the top of the line hose.  Stay away from cheap hose, dirty hose, and crazy hose.  You will love these hose.  These are some fine hose.  Bright green is pretty fly on hose.  These are well built hose.  Some people like kinky hose.  I personally do not.  These hose are not kinky.  Hose are very flexible.  These hose are not skinny.  These hose are fat, but not too heavy.  These are tough hose, but I have no problem with these hose.  You can never have enough hose."
4.0,"It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.
Pro's:
- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.
- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.
- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)
- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.
- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.

cons:
- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.
My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.
- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the garden

Otherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!
I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.
3-4months and still in excellent condition!"
5.0,I was skeptical that a hose could be easy to use and non-kinking while being a full 100 feet long.  It works.
5.0,"This garden hose feels strong and sturdy. Overall feels like a quality product! I purchased the 100 foot hose and have not had any issues with it.

2017 update (5 years later): this has still been one of the best purchases I have ever made, this has outlasted several other garden hoses and is superior in quality."
5.0,no kink and tough. bought 300 ft. went back to get another 200 ft. and they had raised the price $10 guess they were selling to much of it.........
4.0,"I first bought Flexogen back in 1992. I bought two 25 footers and one 50 footer. Last year the female end of the 50 footer got run over and flattened to such an extent that I couldn't fix it. I mailed both ends back to Flexogen, now Gilmour who in turn is owned by Fiskar, and received a new 50 foot hose.

Yesterday this new hose developed a balloon and blew out. Meanwhile the 30 year old hoses are going strong, even the one that this one was meant to replace. (I put cheap plastic replacement ends on it.) I guess that like everything good, this had to be cheapened to generate more profit, so they cheapened it. What a pity not to be able to buy quality products any longer!

UPDATE!
The guarantee stands!
I received this email from the current owners of Gilmour:

""Sorry to hear about the problem with your Gilmour hose and thank you for allowing us the opportunity to address the issue.

1.0,"As soon as I hooked up this hose and turned on the water for the first time to test it, the hose leaked from under the black collar near the fitting on the end of the hose. Not just a drip or trickle, but a full stream of water spraying out from under the black collar. Very disappointed since this hose had so many good reviews. I have returned the hose, which was a major hassle -- emptying out the water and coiling it up so it would fit back in the shipping box. I will look for another hose at a local store so that if I have a problem, the return won't be as difficult."
5.0,"I have owned this for a year and so far all is good. I only occasionally use it to trim my rose bush, hydrangeas, and a few other flowering shrubs. I am pleased with this purchase and product."
5.0,as avertised
3.0,its ok
4.0,"I've used it to trim flowers, shrubs, small tree branches. It still works great for me."
5.0,Does the Job
5.0,"Really first class all round pruner, price is great value"
4.0,I like these Fiskar products. They stay sharp and are ergonomically well designed. I have their extension pruner and pruning saw. All work well.
4.0,Well made.  Gets the job done.
5.0,Love It
1.0,"Cheaply made....junk. Spring let go after first cut. I had to open them up and repair them, and don't have time to do this every time I use them, which appears will be the case. I will use them til I tire of fixing them, and they will be tossed in the dumpster. What a waste of material. Not happy. Definitely would not recommend."
5.0,Couldn't be easier; I love it.
5.0,I use it to apply car wash. I really don't have anything bad to say yet. The fitting of the applicator are brass and the hose nozzle portion is metal so it think it will last quite some time.
4.0,Make sure you clean it when done!  Otherwise excellent!
3.0,Works well but does leak if tipped to it's side
5.0,Use it for all my outdoor gardening.  Makes mixing and using a snap.
3.0,Eliminates the need to pre-mix.  Still a bit messy.
4.0,"This is easily the best ""garden sprayer"" on the market. The cheap plastic ones you can get at Home Depot or Lowes, or any other store are crap and only good for a use or two. I've used this 5+ times, and it feels like it'll hold up if I maintain it correctly.

However, it could be easier to clean this thing. The handle doesn't detatch from the bottle at all, so gunk can collect. The sprayer easily gets partially clogged if you don't clean it after every single use.

The adjustment dial is extremely stiff and hard to adjust. And I'm not even sure it's working. I seem to go through chemicals at the same rate whether I put it on 10 or 1.

So a good sprayer, gets the job done and is the best one out there. But it could be better."
5.0,GOOD
4.0,"This is a really well built hose end sprayer, especially for the price.  Soooo much better than using a cheapo one gallon pump sprayer."
5.0,works like a charm
3.0,"When it works, works great, but sometimes the spring button on the bottom gets stuck and water won't come out from the sprinkler."
4.0,Very fun. Able to water areas of my that my other sprinklers can't reach and turns itself off. For someone who is forgetful it's perfect.  Only issue is that it doesn't turn corners well. Fun to watch for sure.
3.0,Even I turned off the water faucet but this sprinkler still leaking water out.  The sprinkling system works great only have that leaking problem as a down side of this product
5.0,"My favorite sprinkler system. It's especially useful for non-standard or oddly shaped lawns. Although it takes the same amount of time to water a certain area as it would with one of those rectangular ones that leans back and forth, you only have to set up the hose once, and it's really easy to set the path. I usually spend 5-10 minutes playing with the settings on the rectangular one to get it to water just the right area without spraying my windows or the neighbor's house, and this things saves me those 5 minutes. Every minute counts when you're trying to take care of a family/decompress after work."
5.0,Great replacement for an old 30 yrs. Mel...... that was no longer in production.
5.0,"Love this sprinkler! Had 2 for over 12 yrs. One quit working this summer, so we bought a new one."
5.0,High quality product.  I love that you can set it and forget it and I don't have to keep moving a sprinkler around the yard.
5.0,Wonderful time saving ptoduct.
5.0,"This sprinkler is very versatile. It has a very useful pattern adjustment and two travel speeds. Just place the shut off ramp, turn it on, and forget about it."
5.0,"This is a tank, extremely heavy. You need to make certain that your hose is run correctly, if not it will get stuck and rip up hte grass where it is stuck"
5.0,Good pruning shears.
5.0,WORK VERY GOOD
4.0,"Love, love, love this item. I bought this to cut some shrubs in my yard. This is really sharp and easy to cut with. I am not a strong person, so this really fits me well and I don't need to squeeze too hard. For me it is really comfortable to use."
5.0,"Oh do I Love these!!!!!!- I'm out there trimming my roses and those thorny thick weeds- with such ease-
I love them-"
5.0,Another excellent Fiskars product.
5.0,Good quality and price.  Would buy again.
5.0,Well made shears.  Handle is comfortable to grip.
1.0,so dull- doesn't cut anything
1.0,"I've used it for a few days now, and it just doesn't spring open like I'd want.  I have to wait for it to open all the way before I move on to the next branch to clip.  Fairly disappointed.

*update*
Seems to be getting worse.  I have a tiny yard... maybe 20 small plants/bushes between my two yards and this product is already failing."
5.0,Good sharp blade.  Even cut some pesky tree branches.
5.0,"The hose is not an average 5/8 inch hose. It has the outside diameter of a 3/4 inch hose and is very heavy.
It should hold up to a lot of use."
5.0,"This Flexogen hose is really nicely built. This heavy-duty hose has solid brass fixtures on both ends,and it is flexible. There's nothing that I can say bad about this product. I've had several of these Flexogen hoses in the past, and they seem to hold up well. JC"
1.0,"This is the worst hose I have ever had.  It continually kinks. I will get a kink and I walk back and get the kink out.  I'll move to another area a few feet away to water  and it kinks again in another spot on the hose.  I have noticed that where it kinks, the hose is now showing abrasions.  It will  only be a matter of time that it will start to leak.  The hose isn't even a year old.  There is a life time warranty saying the manufacturer will replace the hose free of charge.  I do not know why I would want another one just like this one.  I would rather spend the extra money and get another hose that does not kink, if they even exist."
5.0,"This is an excellent product. I was sick and tired of cheapo hoses that I had to replace, sometimes in less than a year. Flexogen is a quality product, durable, made in the USA, and carries an excellent guarantee. What's not to like? I use mine with brass quick connects; so easy to use.

Update:  Still going strong.  These hoses are excellent."
5.0,"This hose seems very heavy duty and it is also easy to roll, and I haven't had any issues with kinks.  The ends are very solid.  The only thing now is the test of time/use.  I'll report back if anything bad happens.  Thanks"
5.0,This hose so far has been great at....hosing. If it suddenly bursts into flames I'll be sure to let you know.
1.0,"I purchased two 5/8"" 100 ft. hoses and was initially pleased. However, one of them sprung two leaks within the first 2 weeks of use. These were manufacturing defects; tiny holes that ran all the way through the ""8 layers"" of material. I patched them and moved on. Over the very mild winter here in VA, both of the hoses suffered surface cracks (not through to the inside; outer case only) and sprung new leaks. They were stored outside on a reel. I blew air through them before putting them up so the likelyhood of freezing water in the line is remote. Interestingly, the other hoses on the reel (Swan) do not leak and show no signs of stress. I have had the Swan hoses for 10 or more years.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-10-58100-8-ply-Flexogen-Hose-5-8-Inch-by-100-Foot-Green/dp/B00002N8K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Green</a>"
2.0,"I purchased (4) 50' sections of this hose last year based on it's ratings. My experience with it is that it is by no means kink free. Although better than the ""contractor grade"" rubber hoses previously purchased, kinking is a serious issue with this alleged kink-free product. Meanwhile, Craftsman hoses purchased over 35 years ago as are Swan hoses purchased at BJ's about 15 years ago are far superior and still in use.
Without water pressure in the hose it will kink at every loop. With water pressure it fares better, but it doesn't match my 35 year old Craftsman hose."
5.0,Great hose. I have it on a hose reel cart that I also purchased thru Amazon. The hose does not kink around the reel which I love. I hope Gilmour is right about this being the the only hose I will ever have to buy. I am on a fixed income so I am always looking for products that will last a lifetime or a very long  time. I purchased 100 feet so I have plenty of reach to water my flowers and wash my mobile home. I highly recommend this hose.
5.0,"In addition to its excellent quality and dependability, the Gilmour Flexogen is backed by Gilmour's Lifetime Replacement Policy which states; ""A Gilmour product will provide complete satisfaction for the life of the product or it will be replaced free of charge. For replacement of an unsatisfactory flexogen hose, cut off both ends of the hose and send to: Robert Bosch Consumer Service, One Sprinkler Lane, Peoria, IL 61615. Be sure to include your name, address (not a P.O. Box), diameter and length of the hose and a brief description of the problem you are having. A replacement hose will be shipped approximately two (2) weeks after your information is received.""

I highly recommend this product.

*** Critical Note: Do not use the old Gilmour address. According to Robert Bosch consumer service, requests sent to the old address will delay replacement by 30 to 60 days. This is a result of the resent purchase of Gilmour by the Robert Bosch Company."
4.0,"I like being able to set and go to bed knowing that it will shut itself off after traveling on my 100 foot hose.  I did forget to reset it the first time I use it, but that was my fault."
5.0,"2nd one I've owned, works great"
5.0,"No issues, does a great job"
5.0,I was a little reluctant to buy as I have a large bumpy yard.  The tractor is AMAZING!!  It did everything it was suppose to do and more!
5.0,Functional and good quality
4.0,It works well at watering most of my yard in a single pass.  The only downside is that it can wander off course if asked to make a relatively sharp turn while dragging a long hose.
5.0,My son-in-law said I really needed this Rain Train.  He was right.  Wonderful!
5.0,love it
5.0,"This sprinkler just fixed my yard watering to a once a week task.  I used it for the first time yesterday and my back yard looks like it had a severe thunderstorm attack it.  The front yard doesn't look the same because there's more grass, but the back yard will be a green carpet before long.
Just make sure your curves in the hose are wide turns or it topples over and you won't know until you've looked out to check on it.  Hills or slopes need to be a straight line. make the turn at the top of the slope"
5.0,Does what I want it to do. Works great.
5.0,This product is much better than the options available at your local hardware store because it does not leak. It also allows accurate measurement of whatever you're using while providing an excellent spray strength that allows spraying tall trees.
5.0,Great product.  Well made.  We use it to fight moles and voles with a mixture of castor oil and liquid soap.
4.0,Have found this to be very useful in spraying weed killers on my lawn.  Clear instructions and easy measuring of ingredients.  Effective spray pattern as well
1.0,"Two holes in the sprayer handle are open to the anti-siphon disk of the anti-siphon unit. As a result, water from the hose sprays out of these holes and not to the barrel of the sprayer and I get soaked as soon as turn on the water. I have taken the unit apart, cleaned in of dead bugs and reinstalled the anti-siphon unit to no avail. I will be returning this item to Amazon."
5.0,Well built hose end mixer/sprayer. Quality construction. Lightweight. Easy to clean. Easy to hold for long periods. Fully mixes product. Adjustable diverter allows for you to spray upward or sideways without have to get into a contorted uncomfortable position with your body. I would purchase again. Used it to spray my new trees. Easily sprayed 25' upward. Of course this would be based on your water pressure. My water was pumped from a private well. No city water pressure here.
5.0,I've had this for a few seasons and greatly prefer to buy concentrate lawn care.  No issues at all.
5.0,"I like that this can replace my backpack sprayer, but I wish there was an option for a larger bottle. It does look like it'll last long. Maybe, I can find a replacement bottle that's larger."
5.0,"After using several brands from Home Depot where each broke down after awhile, I finally spent a bit more money and got this one.  This has proven to be a wonderful purchase.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and most importantly, it provides a consistent spray everytime I have used it.  It is worth the price for sure."
1.0,Broke after two uses. JUNK.
5.0,"I bought this because one of the shelters I volunteer for uses them with bleach to disinfect kennels.  They specifically asked for this kind, so I'm assuming they're the best."
5.0,I bought one of these 50 ft. flexogen hoses 15 years ago and have left it outdoors on the ground in summer and winter. Last year it started to split in a couple of places due to weathering in the sun. Any hose that lasts this long has got to be a good buy. I just bought another 75 ft flexogen and I'm sure I will be well pleased with this one too.
5.0,Doesn't kink up...I really like it. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for quality. Cheap price also. Very happy. These reviews are way to long though.
5.0,"I've only used it once but it rolled out straight and was easy to roll up. It doesn't kink or twist. You could probably run a tractor over it without damage. The fittings are very good quality and heavily made. I don't think you could make it kink if you tried.

Excellent quality. I would recommend it if you want a good hose."
2.0,i bought this hose because of one thing - it was touted as very flexible even in cold temps. i would call that a LIE - even when warmed up (my house is about 70) still very hard to coil.
5.0,"Another great Gilmour product, this hose really doses not kink.  I have bought several to replace all the hoses I have around my properly.  Great products, if you need a hose do not settle for anything less than a Gilmour."
5.0,My last hose got a kink that wouldn't go away and was impossible in cold weather. I ordered this hose and it works great. Tried it in cold temps(mid 50s) and it was easy to manage because it stayed flexible. No complaints so far and recommend to others.
5.0,Couldn't go wrong with this hose.  Previous hoses always had kink problems.  This is much better even when the temperature drops in the low 40's.
5.0,"Having tried other hoses that were supposed to be resistant to kinking, this is the first one that lives up to the name. Little harder to work with than a standard hose, but definitely worth the effort."
5.0,I purchased two of the 100foot sections of these for large yard areas to sprinkle and highly recommend this brand as it says- the last hose you'll ever need to buy!
5.0,"As far as hoses go (this one goes 100 feet), this is a good hose. Strong, yet supple. It performs its duties flawlessly. I would buy again."
4.0,"Sometimes does not shut off, Does not always follow a curved path but must admit lawn is bumpy, Still does a fair job so I am satisfied,"
5.0,works as it should
4.0,Looks robust and we'll made however it moves really slow on the highest setting. It shoots water in an arch so needs to keep most otherwise the lawn won't be watered evenly.
5.0,I have used the sprinklers for a few months now and couldn't be happier.  The direction note not to use for newly laid sod but I used them both side by side on the front yard and really did a good job.  I would buy again.  Great product.
5.0,Works great! Simple straightforward design...
4.0,It works pretty good
3.0,"I think this is a god product. but there are things can be improved to make it great.
im only using this in my font yard, which is about 5k sqft. there 2 major issues:
1. it moves very slow, and im only getting 1/4 inch water because there is only one hole on each end. On the fast setting, it will need about 2.5hr to cover the whole area. if i use the slow speed, it will need 5+ hr.

2. sometimes it won't stop by itself, especially true when last section is not straight. I think also the hose it is dragging on the back are also contribute to that. You will have to use a timer to avoid wasting water.

3. adjust the angle is a pain for the coverage.

4. it does not have enough power to pull 200ft hose. it stopped around 150ft, and the weight of the hose on its back is just too much"
5.0,saves trouble of moving the sprinkler! works well
5.0,Worked just fine.
3.0,need good water pressure and GPM or you will be disappointed.  It does what it says if the water pressie is what it needs. Very solid unit and easy to set up.
5.0,Great pruners.
5.0,GREAT buy!
4.0,Good product but arrived with minor damage. The orange circle that slides to lock the clippers was chipped on one side.
5.0,This is a strong pruning shear. I have used it a couple times and I'm very happy with it since it cuts pretty well.
5.0,Gets the job done!
5.0,I buy flowers for myself every week and it's nice to finally have shears that will effortlessly trim stems down. Easy to handle and feels durable and sturdy.
5.0,"Very sharp, straight out of the package.  Comfortable in the hand.  Clips through branches and small (1/2"") trees with ease."
5.0,Love the size of these and they work very well!
5.0,"These are nice pruners--my second pair, as I recently gave my old (10+ years) pair to someone just starting a garden. They cut cleanly, feel good in the hand, and are durable."
3.0,They seem to have a small gab between the blade and the opposite metal surface. So when cutting some small plants it just breaks the stem instead of cutting it.
1.0,This product feel apart in multiple ways after 4 uses.  A complete waste of money.  It also did not deliver the pressure promised.
5.0,It's works good
5.0,"Gilmour seems to have stopped making them, buy the Hudson model (same in every way) now.  Very easy to use, pretty accurate and durable if cared for."
5.0,Works well and accurate.
5.0,"Have had the sprayer for a year - use it monthly with a mixture of effective micro-organisms, humic acid and sea minerals for the yard. Well-built, easy to use and works like a champ!"
1.0,I expected to receive a gilmour 362 sprayer.  Instead I received a Chapin sprayer which appears to be a copy of the Gilmour sprayer.  On line there are several other copies under various brand names.  Most of these are lower priced.  I chose the higher priced sprayer because I thought the supplier still had a stock of genuine Gilmour sprayers.  I hate bait and switch.
4.0,"Professionally-built and doesn't leak, works flawlessly.  Easy to disassemble and clean.  Excellent spray pattern for effective surface coverage.  Mixing measurements are precise.  Good all-around addition to any household landscaping equipment inventory.  Wish it were a little bit larger capacity."
5.0,"this is the best  no-mix sprayer I have ever tried ,thanks to others reviews, counts many have been sent to the land fill this is a keeper"
1.0,"You can't set it down without it leaking your herbicide all over itself. It turns and twists so you can't really control it as much as you'd like. It doesn't really disperse well, it sprays water to the sides and the middle of the spray seems to contain most of the herbicide, so it doesn't really mix it into the stream well. Pain in the butt to get the hose off and on, it should contain a swivel at the base of the connection."
5.0,Works great.  Good quality.
5.0,This is a great product.  It is an addition to the one that I already have and am glad to have found it at such a great price. Shipping was fast also.
2.0,"There are a lot better quality hoses for the same or lower prices at local stores.  This hose looks pretty.  I bought it to replace my rubber hose on my hose reel.  The old one was cracking in the sun and heavy.  I could have replaced it for the same price as this hose.  Instead I chose this 8 ply non-kink, highly rated hose.  It was easy to unroll and light to handle.  Unfortunately there was no way to install it on the hose reel without it kinking at the hub connection of the hose reel.  I have two other hose reels with heavy vinyl/rubber hoses.  Both of them easily make the ""hairpin turn"" necessary to connect to the hub of the hose reel.  Unfortunately this Gilmour Flexogen hose kinks not only at the ""hairpin turn"" but also as it threads in to the bottom of the reel itself.  The pressure of the hose wrapped above it collapses the hose, limiting pressure. The plastic hose end protector included with the hose is quite short and will not protect it from kinking as it enters the reel.  Not wanting to return a wet hose to Amazon, I purchased a 45 degree brass adapter, which with some effort, allowed the hose to be used on the reel.  Now that it's been ""jury rigged"" in to working, it's nice and light and works well.  I wouldn't recommend this fix.  It was time consuming and effort intensive."
5.0,"I FIRST USED THE FLEXOGEN HOSE BACK IN THE 1960'S .I BOUGHT A 50 FT. SECTION BACK THEN AND JUST THRU IT IN THE TRASH LAST MONTH. I THINK THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. WHEN THEY SAY THE LAST HOSE YOU WILL EVER BUY,THEY CAME CLOSE TO MINE.I HAVE SOME SEARS BLACK HOSE AND ANYBODY WHO HAS HANDLED THIS HOSE
 WILL TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THE BLACK COMES OFF EVERY TIME IT GETS WET.
THIS IS GOOD STUFF. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT ."
1.0,"I really wanted to love this hose to replace a too heavy, too kinky hose. Even though some reviewers indicated problems, I decided to go ahead and order from Amazon anyway. It arrived quickly and well packaged. After unwinding and unscrewing the old hose, I attached this hose and wound it on the hose reel, attached the sprayer and turned it on to have water spray from two holes in the body of the hose and only a trickle come out of the hose end. How disappointing. Well now I was wet and muddy and I had to unwind the hose, clean it off and wind it up to fit back in the box for return shipment. Well I am an elderly woman and found this whole procedure difficult and messy. I have to say that the return was very easy and I got my refund with no problem. I'm still using the too heavy, too kinky old hose that at least doesn't leak."
5.0,"The product was shipped out fast and received it earlier than expected.  Initially the hose leaked between the collar and the hose but after a half hour of it holding pressure it stopped.  No leaking since then, and the hose works great.  The ends are of good lasting quality."
1.0,"I have the 100' 5/8 hose. It kinks up on me 3-4 times a use, just watering about 20 spots on my yard. The walmart hose I got years ago hasn't kinked once. Wish I would've just gotten another one of those."
1.0,"After reading several good reviews about this hose, I decided to order one.  First concern was that it arrived in a box without an invoice....just a hose in a box.  The first time we used the hose, it kinked and that's one of the reason we ordered it.  It wasn't supposed to kink.  Lastly, after using it about 4 times, it sprung a leak as the result of a small hole/tear in the hose.  Unbelievable!"
5.0,I purchased the 75 ft hose from Amazon.com  besides that they had them in stock and super fast delivery they also had the very best price and not by just 50 cents. Thanks Amazon. These Gilmour Hoses are the best hoses on the market. I own 4 of these hoses the 60FT and this one the 75 ft. They have very heavy brass fittings that will take a car running over them and not crush.  I'm glad that Gilmour has not cheapened this hose to save a buck.
1.0,"The hose appears to be strong but will it stand the test of time.  Not sure how it handles hot water from lying in the sun - but I will soon find out  since I live in the south and the sun bakes these hoses until they melt.  With or without water in the hose I have not found one that will take the heat of the sun for over just a few years.  It is too soon to say - but this hose appears to be well made.

I am amending the above review.  The hose broke and the company does not honor the lifetime warranty.  It lasted less than a year.  The end swelled up and leaked a steady stream only to get worse every day.  The company appears to be in some sort of transition or something since they do not answer to anyone that I can tell.  I think Amazon should remove this product since the warranty claim is outrageous and they have no intentions of honoring any claims.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."
5.0,"I have several of these hoses.  Some have been out in the elements for over 15 years without any problem.  Baked in the Colorado sun (very high UV), frozen (who has time to bring them in?), kids running across them in hot sun and freezing temperatures.  The only problem I've had with any of my hoses is that they might break or leak if you hit them with the mower -- can't blame that on Gilmour!  And they are flexible; much more so than other so-called flexible hoses.

They aren't kidding when they say, ""The last hose you'll ever buy.""  Worth every penny."
5.0,Can't get better.
5.0,we love it
3.0,Pretty cool but gets hung up going around bends at times.  Found it much cheaper at Walmart.  (after the fact)  Honestly not worth the money unless you have a  long straight yard and not trees to go around.
5.0,One of the greatest things you can buy for your yard. So much better than a 5 sprinkler setup with timers. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,Works great!
3.0,Great product exclamation point however I cannot figure out how the sprinkler to move? Any insight would be very much appreciated
5.0,These sprinklers are very sturdy. They cover a large area. Seem to do a great job!
5.0,"I got one of these when I had a rental and the landlord didn't get the sprinkler system turned on. It works great, reliable, and is heavy. Don't let the hose twist if you have it going around corners, as it will loop the pull tight into a kink. It works great, and even though I have now bought a house with a good sprinkler system, I'm keeping it. Hey, I like tractors "
5.0,"Hello, it did everything you said it would. I will use it regularly. Thank you"
1.0,"Solid metal on the outside, cheap plastic on the inside. It worked perfectly the first time, but when the water was turned on again the insides came out and it was done, beyond repair."
4.0,Excellent product!
5.0,Best I have used.
3.0,It did not meet my needs
4.0,Not a bad sprayer
5.0,"The 50 gallon gas powered sprayer that my Uncle gave us broke.  I don't like using anything gas powered - mower, trimmer, saw.  Hate the smell.  Bought this as a stop-gap replacement and actually like this better than the cumbersome sprayer that either had to be hooked up to an ATV or dragged uphill by disgruntled teenage boys.  We bought an additional 100 foot hose so we can reach all 28 trees in the orchard.  We can easily switch sprays for the different types of trees.  I think we use less spray with this sprayer because it is more accurate and the spray isn't covering everyone and everything nearby. Initially my husband was worried that we wouldn't have enough water pressure from the well to reach the tree tops, but that hasn't been an issue either.  I highly recommend this product."
5.0,"This is a great, professional applicator.  I recommend this to anyone."
3.0,"I thought I already reviewed this but here goes again.  It's just okay.  I bought for tree spray and it's a big hassle removing the deflector without breaking it.  I'll probably never re-attach now that I now what trouble it is to remove.  It sprays around 15 feet and may depend on water pressure to shoot farther but I think this is probably as far as you'll get.  The price is really high for this product.

Read the review about how to remove if you need to, that's what I did."
4.0,Excellent sprayer for my pesticides.
4.0,Very happy with this sprayer. This is the second one I've owned - I messed the first one up by cleaning it with a wire. I have cheery trees and this is the only way I've found to spray bug killer to the top of the trees. Not having to mix the chemical is a big bonus.
4.0,"The reservoir is a bit smaller than I would prefer, but the sprayer works beautifully for liquid formulations. Compared to the cheap plastic versions being made now, including by Gilmour, this is a real tool, instead of a disposable toy. Bring it back, Gilmour!"
5.0,Item is just as described. Very sharp. I used these to prune pretty much every over grown plant in my landscaping after moving in and it worked perfectly. I would purchase again.
5.0,The usual great quality from Fiskars. Very pleased.
1.0,Used them once and the lower handle cover kept slipping off.  Tried to glue it back on but with no success.  Useless junk so I just threw them away.
4.0,"I expect Fiskars to be wonderful! Amazing. Maybe that's a problem with my expectations.

These are adequate. Less wonderful than I'd expect for the brand. If they were a ""brand X"" then I'd have been thrilled (but I would have paid a third less).

These are still my everyday pruners, but nothing like my good Felco's. On the other hand, they're a third the price.

5.0,"Reliable, easy to use, sharp, a gardner's best friend."
5.0,works great
1.0,"These bent after about an hour's use making them useless, and I'm a small woman, not very strong.  I tried to adjust them but no luck.  And I missed the return window by 3 days and so now they're just landfill.  I may have received a faulty unit, this is a good brand, but from now on I will buy gardening tools from a physical store with a better return policy."
2.0,"These pruning shears are supposed to be one of the top five rated models out on the market. I purchased a pair after a smaller pair was lost. I purchased from a big box store about a year ago. At first they seemed to work fine and cut well. I have many trees of various types on my property that I must keep pruned to avoid being raked while cutting the lawn. I have oaks, maples, ornamental pears, and white pines. We also prune various shrubs on the property. This spring is the second season we have pruned with these shears and the first one with heavy use. I had trouble with the branches twisting and getting jammed between the blade and anvil. A majority of the cuts were fine, but eventually I noticed the cuts became more of a tear as opposed to a clean cut as expected. This makes it harder to do the job as it requires me to wrestle with the tool to complete the cut. Eventually the handle covers came off. On examination of the shears I noticed that the edge of the blade was chipped and curled over making it dull."
1.0,"When you open the shear after using 5 minutes the blade is peeling apart.

Nice soft handles makes cutting easier on the hands."
5.0,"Well-made, cuts through large(r) branches that I planned.  Good items.  Now if it had a sensor so I could find it when I put it down ..."
5.0,Makes growing tomatoes much easier and more convenient.
5.0,I have used this sprayer for a variety of mixtures and have had great success in use and cleaning for use. Thanks
5.0,"Just as the other reviewers say, this is a trouble-free sprayer. I fill the bottle with Miracle Grow liquid, set the dial to 2, and spray away. Even with my black thumb, my plants and flowers look better than ever.  Recommend getting this one instead of the cheapo plastic sprayers."
5.0,Sturdy...probably will last for years!
5.0,Works very well.  Using for mixing/spraying ant killer around my house.  Well made.
1.0,"The product received was not the Gilmour 362, but a similar Chapin unit, might even identical to the Gilmour.  But that's not the point. The Chapin unit is available for half the price on Amazon."
1.0,Easy broke
5.0,"Great tool, does everything it was designed for."
5.0,Thanks
5.0,Gives acurate aplication easily. Very please with purchase
5.0,Works great
5.0,"This sprinkler is wonderful. The faster speed setting is more than sufficient, even on the dryest days, and it covers a large radius. Love this tractor!"
5.0,"Run the Hose, make sure arms are oriented the right way, put er in low gear and let it water your entire lawn while your at work. Simple and easy. I have 2 and love em"
5.0,Works very well. I have 3
5.0,"I've been holding off on buying one of these for years because of the price. Well the price really hasn't changed in all this time and now I wish I had bought this years ago. It does an awesome job watering, covers a ton of area and is so much easier to use than standard stand-alone sprinkler. It easily handles pulling 300ft of hose (in roughly a straight line) with no issue of bogging down. Highly recommend the investment."
5.0,My husband is very pleased with his RAINTRAIN - I hardly ever please him with gifts but he likes this one!
2.0,"The cheap plastic gears in this break almost every time the sprinkler goes off the hose track and ends up grinding itself up against an object until it breaks the gears.
Nelson is very unhelpful in fixing it or telling you how to, and they obviously make a lot of of after sales money selling very expensive motor/gears kits to people who are dumb enough to invest more money into this cheaply made sprinkler"
5.0,Well built. Works beautifully and does a great job
2.0,"stopped in the middle of the lawn!
still spraying water, but not rotating or moving"
5.0,"Great way to water a large area.  By simply adjusting the sprinkler wands, the width of area covered can be easily be modified. This sprinkler is very well made and will turn off when it reaches a predetermined point."
4.0,"Purchased at the end of June and so far so good. As a gardener your hose is one of your most important tools. I will gave this a 4 star for now in hopes this hose will last. So far looks good no with no blisters. For those of you looking to buy hoses I would advise you stay away from NEVERKINK hoses and SWAN hoses they developed blisters then pin hole leeks and eventually exploding. I had bought 2 SWAN hoses one last fall and one just this spring both developed leeks then exploded in June. I tried contacting SWAN via e-mails and calls, they will not respond and don't answer phones because they don't care about their customers."
4.0,"I've used the hose for 30 days and have had no kinking. I like that it's not heavy like some high end hoses. No problems other than I'm not fond of the bright green color. I like to leave the hose coiled beside a shrub in the yard so would prefer something that isn't as noticeable, maybe a dark green or brown."
5.0,This is the second Gilmore hose we purchased this year from Amazon and so far it has not kinked and works fine.  Not too heavy to pull around the yard either.  I took the 5/8 inch for extra durability and I do believe that was a good choice. Price was reasonable for this hose. Great buy!
5.0,"We have extreme diffences in temperatures (Colorado), and I have purchased hose s that claim to be non kinking --hoses twice the price of this hose.  The Glmore flexgen is the only hose that works as a non kinking hose and doesn't irritae me like so many other hoses I have used. Purchased 1st one at Costco, but as usual, they carry something different now, my Home Depot & Lowes did not have my hardware store did, but at $59.99, on Amazon same hose $39.97"
5.0,The best Hose on the market.  Well worth the price and proberly will never have to buy another Hose again.  You get what you pay for.  Highly recommend to all.
5.0,"I've had this hose for about two years.  The summers where I live are about five months long, and high temperatures are often in the low 100s.  Every hose I've used prior to this one kinked badly, even a Sears one that was ""guaranteed not to kink.""  This Gilmour hose has lasted through two outrageously hot summers and a pretty cold winter, without developing a kinking habit.  It's vastly superior to every hose I've used before.  For what it's worth, I usually keep it rolled up on a reel when not in use.  This probably helps prevent kinking, but the cheaper hoses I've used before also were kept on a reel a lot of the time."
5.0,"The Flexogen hose is incredible.  I've used them for years with never a problem with kinks.  Even when I'm pulling it through the yard and manage to tie it up knots, all it takes is a quick shake and it straightens right out.  I'm still using one I bought over 25 years ago (I did have to replace the end after I accidently drove over it with my car, but that wasn't the hose's fault)."
3.0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-10-58100-8-ply-Flexogen-Hose-5-8-Inch-by-100-Foot-Green/dp/B00002N8K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Green</a>

I received this hose about a month ago. I noticed that the female fitting had a leak. The company used an ""O"" Ring to seal rather than the normal washer. Luckily I had a slightly larger and more robust ""O"" Ring that fixed the leak problem.

I also noticed a strong odor coming from the hose when initially setting it up. I did notice the odor not too long ago, but for the most part it has subsided.

Again on initially setting the hose on my reel, opening the faucet and letting the hose fill I noticed a good deal of the expansion of the hose diameter.

After I finished with the hose I called Gilmour's customer service. After telling them about my impressions of their product the agent seemed to have a minimal interest in what I was saying.

I came close to sending this hose back to Amazon. It seems to be functional and I can treat it gently if necessary. I do have doubts about using it commercially or in an abusive manner."
3.0,"While this hose may last you a life time, you will have to replace it at some point, Gilmour does stand behind their warranty. Though the brass couplings themselves are indeed heavy cast brass, the brass part that attaches them to the hose itself are actually thin brass stampings, and through a combination of corrosion and mechanical wear, eventually fail. Further, the hose is really heavy and stiff, unless it's been lying in the hot sun, it does not flex and actually does kink very easily. If you drag a kinked hose over concrete or asphalt, you will wear the hose through at that point. I returned mine to point of purchase (Lee Valley Tools) and they immediately gave me a replacement, saving me having to mail away the required ends and wait for a new hose to come in the mail: in the summer one can't be without a garden hose. In hindsight, I wish I had sought out a dealer for Swan hose, definitely more flexible, better hose ends and Swan has upgraded their warranty coverage to match Gilmour's."
4.0,"I am so happy I bought this hose.  Every one I have purchased prior to this has burst in a short period of time.  So far I have had no problems at all with this one.  I only wish I had bought the longer one, but didn't want to spend the extra money in case this one would fail also."
1.0,disappointing.  spring mechanism  gave out after minimal light use.
5.0,"my favorite, third pair in 20 years"
5.0,Use them every garden day!
5.0,very good clippers
5.0,Sharp
5.0,Thank you!
5.0,"very useful, but looks like ....used one..."
5.0,Great shears.
5.0,LOVE IT
5.0,Great product.
5.0,"good sprayer, quick shipping!"
5.0,"Best pre-mix sprayer out there. I have used this a lot now and really like it.
Good product."
5.0,easy to use and does a good job
5.0,Able to clean siding on house without a ladder and didn't have to buy a pressure washer. Great product.
5.0,GOOD PRODUCT
4.0,"These are the best residential grade sprayers, period. I gave it 4 stars because they are no longer made in the USA. As long as you rinse them out after every use they stay perfect."
5.0,"This is the best mixing sprayer I've found.  As others have said, you should rinse it after use.  But, they are awesome.  I don't know why they discontinued these.  Why???"
5.0,Works great. Much easier than the pump sprayer.
5.0,This will spray about 30 feet under and around the house.  I also used it to spray a swarm of bees that would not move on after a few days.  I use it with Talstar Pro Multi use insecticide for DIY spraying.  Kills BLACK WIDOWS dead.
5.0,"Replacing an earlier model  50 year old!  Need I say more, works great.  Mainly used for weed killer."
5.0,"Sturdy, works well, easy to move around & operate. Plus, it's super cute!"
4.0,"This Nelson Raintree Traveling sprinkler has some positive features. Built with a steel body, it appears nearly destructible. Its ""traveling"" feature means that once set in place and with the hose set out in the middle of the track you want watered, it will move on its own. You don't have to run out to repeatedly move the sprinkler. And the little ramp that comes with it cane be set where you want the sprinkling to end, since the sprinkler shuts off on its own when it reaches this point.

There are a couple drawbacks. Most importantly, it really only works well when you have a rather large open area that needs sprinkling. If you have large trees in your yard (as we do), it's less practical. We need a separate sprinkler for this. Also, the sprinkler is quite heavy. This is not a lightweight piece of equipment."
5.0,This. Thing. Is. So. Cool.  What a great sprinkler if you hate going and moving the sprinkler!  It works as described and it's pretty neat to see it driving around the yard (albeit slowly).. bonus: the kids love it too
5.0,"So easy to use and it does the trick. I just put it down and let it go and 2 hours later, the lawn is done!!"
5.0,"My original broke and I had missed it for years, so I finally broke down and bought another. I love that I can set up my hoses and cover such a large area. And the stop mechanism is so great, as I forget that I have the sprinkler on, sometimes. It is heavy, but I hope that means sturdy!. It is so much easier, than moving a sprinkler around all the time"
5.0,The coolest sprinkler ever!  It makes watering the lawn so much easier not having to worry about moving the sprinkler all the time.  Just line up the hose and let the tractor follow the hose as a guide to where it will water.  Genius!
5.0,Works good
5.0,Got this for my husband to water the grass and it work great
5.0,"Does the trick, would buy another"
4.0,"Works well when watering areas with well established sod.  When it is used in an area that was recently planted, it dug a hole."
5.0,"I'm no hose expert or anything, but this hose is clearly much higher quality than any of the other hoses I own.  I was able to stretch it from one side of my house, around to the other side of the house, over a fence and into the pool without getting a single kink. No chance that would ever happen with my other hoses.
Also, the connectors on the hose are of very high quality - no leaks whatsoever.  I'm going to buy more to replace all of my other hoses. Definitely Recommended!"
4.0,"Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had two hoses develop problems. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.

Have sent two back for warranty replacement over last six years with no problem. Just cut off ends and mail in. Good customer service. Will buy more for sure."
5.0,"I kid you not this hose is one of the best purchases I have made for the house.  I've used several cheaper ones that have leaked, torn, and had terrible flow.  This hose carry's plenty of water and has really cut down on my flower watering time.  It is kind of heavy but I am assuming this is due to the '8 plys'.  It feels great and does a fantastic job.  And it has a lifetime warranty.  You can't lose."
5.0,The Gilmore hose is a well constructed hose that will last for a long time. While it can still kink at times it generally stays usable more so than most other hoses. The brass fittings are heavy and will last the life of the hose. I liked the hose so well that I bought another and will never buy another hose at the local home improvement center.
2.0,"I am only giving this hose two stars because it is HEAVY and simply not easy to use.  Not only that but getting it stretched out to its full length is difficult due to its weight and the tightness of the coil that it was in in its packaging.  I do believe that the hose will last me a long time and maybe the fact that it is so heavy proves it is well-made, but, if you are a woman without much upperbody strength and you do not want to struggle to move a hose from place to place in your lawn or garden, then, this is not the hose for you."
4.0,"One of the best hoses I have used. Warm weather service has been good,waiting to see how it performs in near freezing temps."
5.0,"Its a great hose, I bought another after I bought the first. So glad to find a hose that doesn't kink. It is helpful though if you also buy a portable hose reel with wheels, as it is a heavy hose and the reel will help in keeping it together, Ames or Suncast make the plastic versions."
1.0,"Well I waited to use this hose til the summer, and shame on me as the return window closed April 4th the brass fitting, where the threaded end of the hose attaches to the rubber sprays water like a fountain, poorly made, poorly fitted piece of expensive JUNK!!! Shame on you Amazon- re-thinking my Prime membership over this one,I bought two, both leak and it's a pressure fitting so there is no repair POS!!!!!!"
3.0,"This is supposed to be an all-weather hose.  My experience is that it still gets stiff, though doesn't crimp and crack in the cold weather like other hoses.  Overall it's sturdy and I use it for filling my horse buckets year-round.  Good hardware and the kink-protector at the spigot works well.  I would give it a B.  I was just hoping it would be more flexible in cold weather."
5.0,"I think these hoses are absoutely terrific ... after experimenting with many different types of hoses over the years, I'm sold on them ... I've used them in different sizes, and love their flexibility in coiling, durability, great water flow, and nice clean appearance ... I have four of them in use, one at each of our home's main outdoor water taps ... my personal advice: ""Go for Gilmour!!"""
5.0,these are great never buy another sprinkler. my last one was 15 years old and my dog chewed the wheel on it that the only reason i got a new one
5.0,Bought this for my husband to water out yard . It works like a charm . Moved right a long the hose and covered the yard .
5.0,met all expectations!
4.0,It works pretty good easy to setup. The more water pressure you have the more area you water. I would  recommend it to anyone.
5.0,This self traveling sprinkler works great and you can adjust how far you want the sprinkler to spit out the water.
5.0,"Exactly what I needed having a sweeping, curved front lawn. I have the only green lawn in my neighborhood. Set and forget it!"
5.0,"We really like it, it makes watering the yard so much more enjoyable and easy.  Than you so very much."
5.0,Love the auto shut off feature!
5.0,"This purchase was to replace a 25 year old tractor just like it.  As long as you can protect the aluminum sprinkler arms in the off season these tractors work forever. We have a steep backyard but this tractor his heavy enough to drag a 50 ft length of water filled hose up the hill and when placed carefully, make a turn at the top (requires a weighty front end to keep on track at the top).  Makes all turns easily on normal terrain. Would never consider a different tractor-type sprinkler."
5.0,Works as advertised....Even goes over the hose to hose connection.  Great for a long area to sprinkle.
5.0,Works very well when you read the instructions
3.0,My sprayer finally broke after many uses.  The unit broke off from the bronze head unit into the black circle screw cap. bottle fell on to patio floor and splashed everywhere.
5.0,It comes already assembled and it works like it says it does.
5.0,"As opposed to some that make a stronger spray in the beginning then weaken throughout the usage, this thing appears to keep the mix concentration even throughout the spray usage."
5.0,"Works great, arrived on time"
5.0,"Works great for spraying my fruit trees, these type sprayers are difficult to find. Would work on all spraying applications"
5.0,"Spray distance and quality of sprayer.  I conducted my own trial-test of hose end sprayers, auditioning the Ortho Dial N Spray, and the Hudson Chameleon - - - most important to me was spray distance and quality/durability of the sprayer - - the Gilmour won hands down.  On distance - - let me give the definitive answer on this - - the Gilmour comes with the sprayer attached as pictured,  here's the deal,  the same distance/height that same spray nozzle will spray, is the distance this hose end sprayer will spray.  And, quality,  it's worth the extra cost for he durable quality.  I expect this sprayer will last me a lifetime."
5.0,"Gilmour makes good stuff.  No exception on this product.  Constructed of Chrome & Brass on the important parts, precise flow. A+ product recommended, including Amazon for fast ship"
5.0,This has completely replace my need to power wash the siding(saving me good money). First sprayer I have had that can handle bleach without corrosion. Shoots strong to about 25ft
2.0,"Tested the sprayer as soon as it arrived.  The parts are both metal and plastic, and they all seem to come together well.  The dial from 1 to 10 can be tricky if you don't read the instructions - if the top screw is on, it means tablespoon, and if out, it means teaspoon.  The arrow pointing to the correct number being used may be difficult to see.  Screwing it on the hose is a breeze.  Once the water is on, it works like a charm!  No leakage whatsoever....  I hope this will last for years and years!  Note on the WARNING on the box...""This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.  Wash hands after handling.""  I wish they would have specified the chemical(s) and as to which parts of the product they can be found.  This is really concerning...who knows if we are spraying the so called cancer-causing chemicals in the air and to ourselves?  For this, I am taking away three STARS."
5.0,"Been using these for years. Good price, good cutting for my smaller needs."
3.0,Works good for the price
5.0,Nice and sturdy
5.0,"Serves 90% of the trimming I do in my yard, both in pruning and cutting flowers for sharing with others."
4.0,Very good
5.0,Well built product
5.0,"Good shears, no wobble, lock works, sharp. I've cut up to 1/3"" stem easily. Good value for the price."
5.0,They cut.
5.0,"Comfortable, nice and sharp.  Cuts easily."
5.0,as expected
5.0,I own three Flexogen hoses and definitely recommend them. They are basically worry free and very durable. A great hose.
5.0,Holds up well - they honored their warrantee on an old one that finally gave out.
5.0,"Best garden hose I have purchased.  Will never have to purchase another hose again, unless I desire another lifetime hose."
5.0,I am 87 yrs old and have used garden hose for at least 65 years put up with kinks and heavy rubber finally bought my first Flexogen about 30 yrs ago  best non kink and long lasting hose I have ever owned and thier warranty is unbeatable.
5.0,The gilmour 5/8 inch hose was perfect for the traveling sprinkler-  Several neighbors stopped to look at he combination and ask where I purchased them.
5.0,"I already had one of these on my outside spigot and it has lasted 20 years. Now we have built an addition with another outside connection and there was no way I would buy anything else.  The company guarantees this product forever, and will replace it if it ever fails.  Can't beat that!"
4.0,"I'm a new home owner and I bought a cheap 50' hose to spray weed killer on the lawn. A hose is a hose, so why waste money? I learned quickly what misery a bad hose is. It was kinking in a dozen places before I even unwound it the first time. It was stiff, awkward, hard to move around, constantly kinking. I spent more time troubleshooting the line of hose than using it.

I went online and bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-10-58025-8-ply-Flexogen-Hose-5-8-Inch-by-25-Foot-Green/dp/B00002N67Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 10-58025 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-25-Foot, Green</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-10-58100-8-ply-Flexogen-Hose-5-8-Inch-by-100-Foot-Green/dp/B00002N8K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Green</a>&nbsp;the very next day. These are so much nicer. They feel better in your hand. They move better. They kink less. And they have a ridiculously good warranty (just clip off the ends and mail them into the company for a replacement). You only need so many hoses around the house and you might as well make them good ones."
4.0,"I've got a lot of gardens and a few spigots.  I need long hoses to reach everywhere.  But, since I tend to leave my hoses under pressure and out in the sun and in the way - they tend to get really disgusting and the couplings a bit bent and a pinhole here and there.  So, I was looking for a hose that would last.
This hose seems really solid;  it's color makes it noticeable (to avoid tripping, but it does call attention to itself if that bothers you in the garden);  it works, but I would expect a hose to work.
The only problem so far is that is has kinked on me.  It's probably unrealistic to expect a hose to NOT kink unless it weighs a ton (and light-weight was important cause I'm pulling it all over the place).  And, it unkinks easily from a distance - if you use a throwing motion.  In other words, you don't often have to walk back to the kick to unkink it.  Not a big problem in any case.
But, with hoses, reviews should really be done five and ten years after purchase.  The true value of this hose will only be proven then."
1.0,"I'm angry about this. I took the hose out of the box, hooked it up... and not just one, but BOTH male and female hose connectors begins spraying water everywhere including on myself. It is not enough that Amazon lets you return a DEFECTIVE product. Now you have the JOB of emptying this hose and attempting to wrap it the way it was packaged, THEN, wasting your valuable time  and gas expense in getting it to UPS to ship back. The manufacturer should have to pay something back to the customer for this trouble. The Gilmour slogan on the packaging said ""The last hose you will ever buy"" That is so true ....that was the LAST hose I would ever buy from them."
5.0,"I've bought other hoses that claim to be ""kink free"" but weren't and what a pain it was using them. This one truly is a kink-free hose.  It feels sturdy and of good quality.  I was amazed at how nicely it pulled out from the coil it was in when I used it.  I'd recommend this to anyone in the market for a new hose.  The hose has more than met my expections."
4.0,"Seems to mix proper on insecticide and weed killers. Flush out when done and lube the brass for years of use, as most things are corrosive."
5.0,Best hose-end sprayer I have ever purchased and I used many over the years
5.0,Just what I wanted would deal with again.
5.0,I have a rock landscape yard in Arizona and use this to spray weed/grass preventative.  Saves me hours upon hours of pulling weeds and using a handle sprayer.  I accidentally lost the tube so I just bought another one. This thing is a life saver
2.0,"In my opinion, this product is way overpriced. There are other sprayers in the market costing a small fraction of the price of this one. I bought Ortho 0841010 Dial N Spray Multi-Use Hose-End Sprayer for $11 and have used it about a dozen times already with a great performance and no sign of deterioration."
5.0,"This operates just as the instructions indicate. I am very satisfied--especially with not having to do the necessary mathematical calculations so as to ensure the correct amount of chemical indicated. Simply pour any quantity in the container, dial to the proper setting, and spray away, feeling confident that there is no over or under application. After finishing application, pour the remaining liquid into the original container (liquid chemicals only). Having been a licensed applicator/operator in the professional industries, I strongly advocate this for anyone serious about the proper treatment of chemical to his plant life."
5.0,Great for applying fungicide when you need to be precise with measurements.
1.0,I got two of these.  The first one broke and neither worked as they were supposed to.  They claim you can just add concentrate to the bottle and run the water but the concentrate emptied within seconds of spraying.  Not a very good product.
5.0,This thing is awesome -- I mostly use it with soap to wash my cars.  I love the adjustable mix ratio right on top.
5.0,Cannot wait to use this
5.0,Works great
5.0,Got exactly what I expected.  Works great.
5.0,"With the drought in the South this has been a great product for me. I have a one acre lawn with extensive landscaping.  Only need to move the
sprinkler once to get the entire lawn watered."
5.0,Well made works great
5.0,This is my second one; now I use two of them to cover a lot of garden area more quickly.  My only wish is that it could be adjusted to cover a 10 - 15 foot width.  But it's still great.
4.0,"I used to own an orbit tractor but it died, gearbox failure.  Orbit does not offer parts.... oddly enough the orbit gearbox and Nelson units are near identical I think they are made in the same factory and they add a wedge to the front of the Nelson unit so you can't swap parts as Nelson does sell a replacement drive unit.  Nelson unit appears near identical in quality and build to the orbit unit as well...."
5.0,Pretty cool works great
4.0,Love these.  We own 2 and got one for our son's new house.
5.0,My yard thanks you immensely.
5.0,Nice coverage - Sure beats dragging the sprinkler around and having to remember to turn it off.
5.0,wonderful
1.0,"Similar to another person who reviewed these snippers, I had an old pair of Fiskar snips that looked exactly like these that lasted for years.  Eventually the blades got very dull and the blades no longer closed closely to cut well but this old pair had a great run of several years.  So I thought I would purchase the exact same pair again.  Unfortunately, I have been through two new pairs and they both had the exact same problem.  After a short period of cutting, the blades stick together at the end of a cut and have to be manually pulled apart.  The spring which used to force the blades apart after a cut has been cheapened so that the slightest amount of sap or cutting residue causes them to stick together."
5.0,"These work really great, easy to lock and unlock.  I was able to prune rose bushes easily."
5.0,Love anything Fiskars!!
5.0,"I ordered two of these shears, and so glad I did.  Comfortable to hold."
5.0,Excellent yard shears at a good price.
5.0,"Good price, works well"
5.0,Cuts through rose stems like butter....sharp!  Don't try it on your fingers!
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"Nice grip, and holds and edge.  I have sharpened my several times with a lansky stone.  Have never had an issue.  I have the Corona variety, but have never needed them.  These are roughly half the cost too.  Very good purchase."
5.0,I've had this sprayer for two seasons now and it is still performing beautifully.  I'm able to foliar spray my trees and shrubs easily.  I'm very religious about cleaning and drying it after each use.
5.0,IT WORKS WELL
5.0,The price was fair so I'm happy. Now if all this snow will just melt I'll be able to use it.
5.0,Works as advertised.
4.0,"nice handy little sprayer that's easy to use and clean. the deflector for the nozzle is nice and the dial-a-mix makes applying chemicals to your lawn a no-brainer.

wow. went to order another one and it's gone from $12 to $60. i'll pass."
2.0,"Purchased in July 2013. Worked OK for a while when used five times a year. It reaches 15-20 ft.
It started leaking between the gun/handle and bottle. The black plastic part that connects the handle to the bottle gets lose if the handle is not perpendicular because the weight of the liquid in the bottle makes it unscrew from the handle.
No matter how many times I tightened it, It kept getting lose.
Today while spraying dormant oil and copper fungicide the handle stopped working and the tank fell off and the spray never stopped. The threads no longer work as weak plastic always losses to metal threads. I assume the handle needs to connection to work (on and off) so the only issue may be using the wrong material to connect to the handle.
I always washed it clean. Followed direction etc. This is not a professional tool."
3.0,Buyer Beware - this is a discontinued model and the manufacturer has no replacement parts.  I have used the sprayer for 18 months and it has worked well.  But I couldn't find replacement parts online - called the manufacturer direct and there are no parts available.
5.0,I love this sprayer.
5.0,good price.....good quality
5.0,"This delivers a good, regulated spray without the bother of tank mixing.  It does take some calculating to get the right concentration and the right delivery rate."
5.0,"I have went through many hoses in my day, and this is by far the best I have ever used.  This puts my Neverkink hose to shame and the Neverkink is a pretty good hose.  I have had my Gilmour hose for a few years now and it shows no signs of stopping.  It is almost completely kink free.  It got pinched just right one time and kinked on me but that was with the water off.  With the water on, it has never kinked one time.

It is reasonably flexible in cold weather. I left mine out all winter in freezing weather and it still worked fine in the Spring.

The only drawback of this hose is that it is thicker than a normal hose, and you will have to buy a bigger hose reel than you might think.  I have my 100' hose on a 175' reel and there isn't a whole lot of room left.  I'd say you would need at least a 150' hose reel for this hose.

The durability and kink resistance make this worth the price.  This hose will save you a lot of time and hassle, and the warranty is unbeatable."
4.0,"After a month of use, the hose has been great and has not kinked on me yet."
3.0,Well-made good quality hose but it will still kink.  What else needs to be said?
5.0,"I was in search of a hose that would not kink.  I have tried many with no success, only a great amount of frustration. Watering the garden became one of the worst chores you could imagine.  Every few minutes was spent unkinking the hose. After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this hose. Although it was a bit on the pricey side, I thought that if it truly was kink-free then it would be priceless.  I can report that although I have only had the hose several weeks, the few times I have used it have been perfect. NO KINKS! If this keeps up through the heavy watering times in summer, I would say that this hose is worth every penny."
5.0,"This seems like a sturdy, well made hose.  Connectors are solid brass, hose material is flexible but sturdy and does not kink easily."
5.0,"This hose doesn't kink like the last forever hose I bought. The time saving alone, not having to trace back, unkinking the hose is worth it."
5.0,"This was my second purchase of Gilmour hoses and they by far are the best. Easy to roll up and super strong.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-10-Series-8-Ply-Flexogen-Hose-1-2-inch-x-50-Feet-10-12050-Green/dp/B000XTK97M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour 10 Series 8 Ply Flexogen Hose 1/2 inch x 50 Feet #10-12050 Green</a>"
5.0,"My recent purchase of a Gilmour 8-ply hose was a most pleasant surprise. It is a very substantial hose which I can tell is going to be different than any other hose I've ever owned in that it just won't kink, even if you try. I also needed a hose that can be left out year around, as I have no place to store it.  This one fits the bill because of it's 8-ply construction and quality materials. I did a LOT of comparative shopping before I ordered and yes, it is more expensive than many other hoses, but don't forget the old saying...""you get what you pay for""."
5.0,"i needed a 20' hose.  could not find one, either local or on line.  could find 15' or 50'+ local.  this is as close to 20' as i could find for a reasonable price.  seems standard and fine in every way.  after all, kinda hard to make a bad hose, isn't it?"
5.0,"This hose is truly worth the money...  I mean it!  The first Gilmour Flexogen hose I owned, was while we were stationed at Subic Naval Base in the early 1990s.  The hose was buried under four-feet of volcanic ash when the Mount Pinatubo volcano erupted, and remained buried like that for weeks until we were able to dig out.  The ash had all kinds of toxic and acidic properties, and it ate the paint off of cars and houses.  It also ate holes through our Flexogen water hose.  I followed the instructions:  I cut approximately 8-inches off of the hose and mailed it to Gilmour and explained what had happened.  A couple weeks later a brand-new replacement hose, same length and all, arrived in the mail.  No more questions asked.  This is truly American productivity and American customer service at its best!  This hose is not cheap, but it's worth every penny."
5.0,My husband loves it.
5.0,Works like a charm.  Perfect for big or odd shaped lawns where you would have to reposition the sprinkler several times to cover it.  With this you set the path and the sprinkler turns it self off at the end.
5.0,This sprinkler (actually I bought 2 of them) is awesome!!  We put out a large area of new grass and these work so well to save us time of going and moving sprinklers.  We found when it was just dirt they do get stuck a little (but they do shut themselves off) but once the grass starts growing they work like a dream.  I can image using the others again!!  Definitely recommend!
5.0,"Love it! Set & forget it; not literally, but darn near!"
5.0,Exceeds!!
5.0,This is a replacement for the same model I've had for years.  Works great.
5.0,Sturdy and covers a lot of area.
1.0,The arms on this sprinkler will not stay in!  They fall out continually.  We have had a traveling sprinkler for over 10 years and loved it (by a different company).  This one is useless!  As soon as the water is turned on - the arms fall out.  I am missing the return by a few days - big waste of money. :(
5.0,"Today while watering the front lawn my timer went off letting me know it was time to turn off the water.  I went outside and did not see my trusty yellow sprinkler where it should be.  Long story short it was only halfway done with my lawn and stuck in one place. Gear box doesn't work in high or low speeds.  So I need a new gear box.  However, this sprinkler has been in service since August 2006 so it died after many years of hard use.  I'm going to put a new gearbox in it and hopefully it'll be good until 2026.

I'd buy it again but the parts are 1/3 the price of a new unit! ."
1.0,"I love the functionality of this sprrinkler, but they are cheaply constructed. Worm gears which drive the thing are plastic, and tend to break in a short time. I'very been through 3 of these in 5 years, and have purchased my last one. It doesn't matter which manufacturer you get it from, they're all the same when it comes to the drive box.

They all need to make these things with metal worm gears! If they would, it would justify the price."
5.0,Beats the plastic ones by a looonggshot.
5.0,"Works great to spread 2-4d over the yard, little hard to calculate the flow rate, but overall works great."
5.0,"don't think there is a better product on the market, works well with many options"
5.0,Nice and well made.  Works well.
5.0,gift
5.0,I have use these for 30 years the only one to buy
5.0,"Exerlent product. Can't find it from the local store. Highly recommeded. I even clean the house, power spray w/ it. Wonderful."
5.0,Very hand to have around as I have a very large yard.  The only thing is I do not know 100% of how accurate the spraying is.
5.0,No complaints so far. This sprayer can apply products quickly if you need it too.
1.0,"First time used work fine, filled bottle part way sprayed what I wanted on 2 setting, returned rest of product back to bottle. Cleaned real good, put back in box. Second time used, red cap fell off in grass, saw it hit grass so found in that area, tried to push back on, no luck. So, put a small pair of vise grips where red button went so it would spray. Put it on 1 setting as I wanted a lighter mix. Started spraying, could smell product, looked at bottle and it was using way to much. Switched it on 2 then back to 1, to hear the click, it was on 1. If it is in between numbers it is automatically on 10 max product distribution. Guess I am back to a spray tank. First time a charm, second a nightmare. Leaks out of handle too, but could handle that. Just could't handle amount of product that came out without knowing it before too late."
5.0,"OK, this thing is awesome!  Only had it for a couple of weeks, but this works like a charm!  I wish I would have bought one years ago.  We have a U"" shaped lawn in out yard around a sun deck.  I used to use a rotary sprinkler and would have to move it 9-10 times to water the lawn completely.  I'd set the timer on my phone and move the sprinkler every 20-30 minutes.  Would take 4-5 hours of nearly constant monitoring.  Decided to take the plunge and get one of these.  I use it on slow speed and it takes nearly 5 hours to complete its path, but I just let it go!  Wow!  I love it!!!  The first time I used it on the fast speed, but it didn't lay down enough water.  Things get pretty dry here in the central Texas heat.  Slow speed is perfect!  Now, the first time I did the slow speed, was almost right after I had done the fast speed.  As the auto shut-off worked fine with the fast speed, I didn't worry about the same with the slow speed.  I let it go and went to bed.  Woke up a few hours later and decided to check on it.  The sprinkler was up on the shut off block, at a weird angle.  One of the rods had fallen off and it was just spewing water.  Apparently the soil was soft, and the weight on the machine along with the weight of the hose caused on of the wheels to just dig into the soil all the way down to the ""axle"".  I thought that the gears were probably stripped.  I guess I was lucky that the rod fell off so it was not producing spin.  Tried it the next week and all was well!
The unit seems to be well constructed.  It does weigh a ton, but it needs to.  We'll see as to the longevity.  But from what I've seen, you can pick up a transmission for these for around $25.  Not bad if you have to replace one a year as most of the oscillating sprinklers seem to last a year (even the more expensive metal ones which cost more than $25)
I'll provide updates if appropriate, but so far this thing is gold!"
3.0,"Sprinkler would probably be fine if I had good water pressure.  Pressure is low at highest notch on spigot so sometimes wheels stick in one place, doesn't make turns easily; have to go out and ""unstick"" multiple times.  Takes way too long to cover ground with low pressure."
5.0,Exactly what we expected!
4.0,This thing is really neat. The instructions tell you not to use it on freshly planted beds and it's not kidding. The pressure from the water will rip apart fragile plants.
5.0,"Used it one time, then it started raining,"
5.0,I have owned one of these Traveling sprinkler for many years.  It is an excellent piece of equipment.
5.0,"No more moving the water around!
This guy works great! I did have one derailment, but I think I turned the hose too tight. It rides the hose, covers great and shuts off on the ramp, all as advertised. Great product!"
3.0,"Does what it is supposed to do but it doesn't like bare ground, uneven ground or contact with anything.
Smooth, cut lawn it does very well."
1.0,"This is the worst product imaginable. I purchased one about 5 years ago. After less than a year, the transmission stopped working. I disassembled the unit and found a tooth broke off the cheap plastic gear set. I ordered a new transmission. That transmission broke the next spring. I wrote a letter of complaint to Nelson. They told me the transmission had a two year warranty and if I had proof of purchase, they would replace the transmission for free. I sent them proof of purchase and they sent me a new transmission. Last year was so cool and rainy, I never used the sprinkler. This year, the third time I used it, the transmission failed again. I have a corner lot and the sprinkler runs in a straight line on flat ground. My side lawn is 100 feet long and the sprinkler breaks about 60 feet into the run. That's only 30 feet of hose that it's dragging. I even bought a light weight hose to reduce the load on the gears. The trans gears are beyond cheap! I'd pay $100 for one of these if they came with brass gears. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!"
5.0,Awesome
5.0,Nice shears.  Would buy again.
3.0,"Either grape vines are a bear on pruning shears or Fiskars just doesn't make them like they used to. They still work, but they got nicked up like crazy on the grape vines."
3.0,"Blade is kind of wimpy.  I've already chipped it, although I *was* cutting down some plastic flower stems with wire inside them.  Still.  Would have expected more from such a well-known brand."
5.0,"Simple and does the job as intended.  Like the locking design for extra margin of safety with kids around.  In addition, it does not have the spring/tensioner down the middle that is prone to break or pop out, compared to my previous defunct pruner (big name similar to the beer company).  It may not have the power lever feature on the higher end model, but it does just fine for a quick-and-easy hand pruner.

As someone who adheres to the rule of using the right tool for the right job, I have no qualm recommending this inexpensive hand gardening tool.  In addition, I look forward to testing Fiskar's lifetime warranty when the time comes.  My experience with the aforementioned beer company is 50/50, great for pole pruner but not so for any other gardening tools that require shipping defective units back for exchange."
2.0,"Looking at them in person they look messily made. It had scratches, scuffs and stuff on it.  I thought that would be okay if they do the job. But they don't work on green plants. Only hard stems. I needed them for succulents and herbs. But have only been useful on dying stems and damaged my green plants since they are not sharp enough. They just squeezed through the plants but couldn't get through the skin of the stem. The rounded tip and circle lock to keep it closed is great in case a child gets ahold of it. It doesn't unlock smoothly so it's difficult for me. But then again that's just more protection from a child opening it I guess."
5.0,Great shears
5.0,love it
1.0,"After an hour of use the blades started skewing apart on larger branches. Got the titanium bypass pruners instead (not the power gear, just the regular) and they seem to be holding up much better. These are not for serious work."
5.0,Works great and just what I needed.  Great price!
3.0,Fiskars are historically very sharp and durable.  I rated my recent purchase a three since the spring to reopen the shears once they are activated does not return the shear to the open position.  Somewhat annoying and worth mentioning.
5.0,I was ready to buy this hose from amazon when I decided to check the local stores. To my surprise I found this exact hose at my local ace hardware store for $43.33 tax included. It pays to shop around. By the way this is one great hose and it DOES NOT kink. don't waste your money like I have by buying cheap hoses. I'm sure in the last 5 years I've spent over 100.00 on hoses. This will be the last hose you ever buy.
5.0,"We run an Animal Rescue and are constantly using hoses for outside work.

We would always go through hose after hose.  They would get holes in them or we would run over the end and bend it.  The would never last more than one season.

We got one of these hoses last winter and used it in the winter in Wisconsin.  It never failed, doesn't kink and I am sure I have run over the end a few times with out it bending and ruining the whole hose.  We liked it so much we got two more.

This hose is worth every penny."
1.0,"It pains me to write this review but I have to share my experiences with the Flexogen hoses.  I've been using them for at least a decade.  At first, I loved how they stayed flexible in cooler weather.  After a few months the problems began though.  I started getting pin sized holes in the hoses.  I chalked it up to the rosebush hitting it while I unraveled it.  I bought another one and placed it in the backyard where there are no thorny bushes.  6 months later the hose seemed to fall apart from the inside out.  It developed a large bulge on the side of it and was ruined.  I sent it back to Gilmour and they sent me a replacement.

Two months later the replacement for the front yard developed another split on the outside and started spewing water.  I sent that one back to Gilmour and they once again sent me another one.  A year later and both of those replacement hoses are once again ruined.  The backyard hose has developed another bulge and looks like it will burst at any time, while the front yard hose has developed another inch long split.  This split is in an area of the hose that is always on the reel, so I know it didn't get poked by anything.  I believe as someone else stated these hoses can't take the sun!  This doesn't explain why the one in the backyard keeps developing bulges in it though.

After at least 6 Flexogen hoses that have now failed on me, I'm done with these.

UPDATE: 3-1-12.  For anyone out there that's thinking of buying this hose...DON'T DO IT!  I replaced these with a $20 plain black rubber hose from Sears 2 years ago and they are still going strong.  They haven't developed any leaks and they are left outside year round.  They are every bit as flexible as the Flexogens, and they are far tougher around things like rose bushes.  Go to the Sears website and search for ""rubber hose"".  Read the reviews and buy the superior hose.

UPDATE: 6-28-12.  The $20 Sears black rubber hose is still going strong and I drag that poor thing through that stupid rosebush my wife won't let me cut down every day.  The thorns have got be 1/2"" long by now.  I detest that rosebush.:p

UPDATE: 8-7-14.  Both $20 Sears black rubber hoses are still going strong well over 4 years later.  They are used in the exact same environment that the Flexogens were, but they have held up just fine after all of these years where the Flexogens died in months.  They both still have the same ends of them too.  The rubber is still as flexible as it's always been, and they don't kink as easily as the Flexogens did either.  I leave them both out year round and use them in the winter for car washes and hot tub fills.

I see that Gilmour has apparently redesigned the Flexogen hose or at least changed the color of the hose to gray now.  It's also gone from a 6-ply design to an 8-ply.  Maybe to fix the bursting issue?  I don't know if this change has remedied the bursting problem mine suffered from or not.  Regardless I'm happier with the much cheaper Sears rubber hose so I'll be sticking with them."
5.0,No more fights with the garden hose.  Coils and uncoils easily for yard clean up.  Great product!
5.0,"I was looking for a hose that was substantial and as light as possible.  Those two attributes are usually mutually exclusive.  That's what I got.  While this hose is not featherweight, it does seem slightly lighter than the other ""deluxe"" hoses that I found at the big box stores and at Sam's.  Definitely lighter than rubber too.  Not as light as the cheap dark green hoses with network visible from the outside, but those really kink.
Can't say much about durability, since I've only had it a month."
5.0,You can almost always expect to pay double for a product made in USA but in many cases the quality makes it well worth it.  This hose is very well built and works great!
5.0,"I bought this hose at a very low price (it has since doubled) for my patio. It is extremely high quality, and that's easy to see. Not heavy, but not light either given the heavy duty eight ply construction. Doesn't leak, kinking is nearly a non issue, and the couplings are machined and leak free. I realize this is just a garden hose, but it's a superb product. Best part is it is USA made, and apparently they don't mess around with their warranty. I will be purchasing the 50' 3/4"" hose for the lawn as well."
5.0,"This product is of exceptional quality and value. I wouldn't but any other brand for any reason.  Great Buy, Great Quality, No Problems."
5.0,Have used this hose for the last 17 years. Save the ends and return them if the hose ever fails. They are good about giving new hoses that fail. No matter how old.
4.0,I found that this hose was just how amazon described it. The hose is a little stiff but doesn't kink as much as a normal hose. I also own one of the neverkink brands and this is a little stiffer than those hoses for comparison. Knowing that I have a lifetime warranty that company will actually follow through with is a great piece of mind for me!
5.0,"Bought this for my husband as a Father's Day gift, this was a great sprinkler. He said it works fantastically."
5.0,Great for watering garden..  Fun to watch operate..  Built heavy..  Thanks
2.0,Had to return it as it did not work correctly
5.0,Looks durable as you can replace all parts on it.  I love this thing
4.0,"The older Raintrains had metal gears and were very tough. Knowing that these newer ones have plastic gear sets should be a hint to the user to be very careful with them. Don't push or pull the train while the gears are engaged (not set to ""neutral"").  I now have 3 of these trains and there are some keys to making them work on sloped ground (which is all I have).
1. Always run them downhill, not uphill. The wheels can dig into the dirt and then it will ""high center"" the rear axle, making it stay stationary.
2. If there are holes or soft areas in the irrigated area, avoid running your hose (the train follows the hose path) over these areas as the train will either tip over sideways or get stuck.
3. To adjust ground speed, adjust wands so they do not spray straight up. angle them up at a 45^ angle to the ground. This will increase ground speed and quicken the cycle although relative water output to the irrigated area will decrease accordingly.
All in all these do quite well. If you have a level lawn, they should work great.  If you have slopes, read the tips above."
1.0,BE CAREFUL......THIS IS NOT A 50970 MODEL. IT'S A 1865.
4.0,"Pros
Walks along watering, the spray distance is adjustable. Does a nice job and doesn't waste water. There is an auto shut off that you place on your hose. When the sprinkler gets to the shutoff, a switch is pressed and the thing stops. The unit follows the layout of your hose on the ground pulling it behind.

Cons
The unit is heavy and the hose makes a mess of your yard. If it gets off track and is not following the hose it can be mired in the garden, or worse start walking into the street. To be honest we have two of these and went back to using traditional sprinklers even though we have to go outside and move them all the time. It's a neat toy but I guess if you want your lawn to look nice sprinklers should be installed.

So to review, it waters, walks, and foes the job. It's too heavy for my wife. It can go off track, so make wide turns."
4.0,"Easy to use, great reach, can't pull as much hose as it claims but I think that's more an issue of no grass for grip then a failure on the products part."
5.0,"Love it, but will look for a smaller one..."
5.0,Works great and I love the automatic shut-off
5.0,good
5.0,A good quality product.
1.0,I guess its not meant for watering plants per-se - because the pressure is too high and it starts digging holes around the root if you hold it for few seconds! May be it works for watering green lawns?
5.0,"Thank you , very satisfied with this purchased."
5.0,I used this for mixing an outdoor bleach mix to clean off the algae/mold on my gutters.  It came right off.  A great product.
5.0,"A great sprayer for my ~500 square foot garden. Easy to use, easy to clean."
5.0,Works great at spraying bug chemical in the yard. It's nice to be able to take off the tip that sprays a flat pattern so you can spray pretty far. In my case I would remove the tip to spray my roof and top peaks of my single story roof with no problem. just make sure to bring in during the winter because water seems to be trapped in the brass fittings.
5.0,Works well.  Would buy again.
3.0,top comes out of screw on cap sometimes
5.0,Good quality!
4.0,"It works! I'm still learning how to use it effectively. I was trying to cover the entire front yard in one pass but it turns out it is more effective if used on narrower strips so a portion can be watered thoroughly. My only gripe is that it can't really do more than one curve because the weight of the hose will derail it and send it straight to my neighbors!

This is definitely not a set it and forget it type of sprinkler but it  evenly waters our lawn. You need to manually move it still but I think it works as intended."
5.0,"Can't get better, and I've had both lawn and this type of watering systems."
5.0,"functions very well, solidly constructed, does what it tells you it will do with out many problems. A learning curve to set up the turns, but once you figure that out it is very functional and fun to watch, lol. Easy to adjust spray radius. The automatic shut off is very useful to water at night and not have to worry about flooding the yard, just follow the directions which are pretty  straight forward."
3.0,"This works well on well established grass but if you are working in an area of thin grass,  it loses traction in the dirt and digs itself in."
5.0,I purchased this for my Grand daughter. I have owned them previously and know it would suit her purpose for a large yard .She was thrilled.
5.0,Works great on our medium sized front lawn.  Able to easily navigate a gentle slope and follow turns in the hose.  This replaces a 4 sprinkler/timer system that I had setup and is doing a better job so far.
3.0,"Gets stuck in mud easily, very well made though"
5.0,"I love this tractor sprinkler! Works great, the arms adjust very easily and it is so nice to not move a sprinkler every half hour. I set it up on a long hose and it can run the length of my yard for an hour and half."
5.0,"Love this sprinkler!!!!  I can run this for hours without having to worry about it.  I have 3 acres, and only half is irrigated. I purchased two of these to irrigate the other half.  OMG, it is so much easier than constantly moving other sprinklers around.  It is very thorough in its coverage, with great adjustments, and such a simple design.  I can run it for a 3 - 4 hour period without worry.  We irrigate from the lake so it's nice having the little screen filter on the hose connection, which I usually need to clean every time I use it, but it is easy, takes only seconds."
5.0,"Works as advertised, but did get stuck once in a soft spot in the sand."
5.0,great as allways
5.0,Works as described.
3.0,"I've used these twice since I received them.  They are not as well made as my older shears.  The metal is not finished as nicely, they are not as smooth and the locking mechanism is stiff and difficult to engage.

I pruned a couple of tea olives and these shears seemed to do a good job.  The cuts were clean and smooth.  I moved on to some smaller shrubs with more tender branches and they struggled a little bit to get a clean snip.  But that might be an issue with other clippers.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  I then pruned a ligustrum and, again, they did an OK job.  But I'd put their maximum cutting depth or thickness at more like 3/8"".  These are simply not sharp enough or sturdy enough to easily bite through anything thicker.

Having shopped fairly extensively for pruners and repeatedly being referred to Fiskars, I am a little disappointed.  The price was fine but I'd rather pay more for a pair I know can handle heavier duty.  My guess is that cheaper products have put pricing pressure on Fiskar so they are probably having these made in China and they have tried to balance cost cutting with performance.  I'd rather pay a few dollars more for a better made product.  That said, I couldn't find anything else that I felt was any better."
5.0,really sharp and does the trick
5.0,work as expected
5.0,AWESOME shears!  Always been a big fan of Fiskars.
5.0,"WORK VERY WELL, AND A CLEAN CUT... WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR.."
5.0,Very handy tool.
5.0,super sharp and easy to use
1.0,"I bought these only a few months ago and they are already full. I don't use it much, but I'm hacking away at flower stems as is i were using two blunt rocks. What's up with the lifetime warranty!????"
5.0,Exactly as offered.  Works great.
5.0,I purchased two of these...they are great. The important thing is to make sure you clean it well after each use. I use these for spraying my shrubs and trees and my house. If you want a sprayer that has great pressure and distance this is the one to use. (If you have terrible water pressure it doesn't make a difference how great the sprayer is constructed. I saw reviews where people complain about this and it is not a defect of the sprayer.
5.0,This little devise has given me the ability to feed my plants and grass effectively.  The calibrations on the sprayer head are correct and enables me to water in my plant food in an easy and correct method.  Buy it!
5.0,Works well and it is easy to fill and regulate
5.0,Must have for spraying chemical in yard.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,Great large area sprayer. I use concentrated mix and adjust the dispenser to the appropriate concentration. I can cover my back yard (3000 square feet) very quickly. Always remember to run a full sprayer of clean water at the end to clean it out. I haven't had any trouble with clogging or change in flow rate.
5.0,This is the best for spraying trees.  Thank you for your service.
5.0,This product works very well. Recmended
5.0,"Wow! This worked exactly like it was supposed to! What a pleasant surprise! I used it all summer for my flower beds and my gardens, and it never failed to do its job. I would simply run clear water through for several minutes after each use, to clean the nozzle and tube. Thanks, Gilmour, for making a product that works!"
5.0,I replaced a new hose that I bought from Home Depot with this product. The Home Depot hose immediately leaked like crazy from its fittings. It was also very stiff and hard to untangle. This hose doesn't drip at all. It is flexible and feels high quality. I will only buy Gilmour hoses in the future.
5.0,This hose is very flexible and very easy to roll-up.  It is the best hose I have ever used as a homeowner.
2.0,Bought this from a local hardware store.  Leaks from the end connector. Tried to exchange it but all they had on hand  was the next model down.  That one worked but after four years it cracked wear it bends to fit my Ames hose reel.  Next time I'm trying a different brand.
5.0,"This Gilmour hose is made out of the best material that I have seen in a garden hose. No kinking, east roll up, and I forsee using it for years to come!"
5.0,"Out of all garden hoses I have ever used, this is the best one I have ever put my hands on. It is perfect for water games with my grandchildren, and it also is still very flexible after a cold night out in the open. I have 5 of these wonderful hoses, and they don't kink at all."
4.0,"I recently stayed at a friend's beach house where the hose was crimped and difficult to use (I know as I watered their plants).  So, I ordered this hose (I have two 50' ones here where I live), and had them sent to my friends' home.  It is an untraditional gift, but much appreciated.  It is true, however, that the material used is not as good as in the older hoses.  My new ones crimped after a year or two."
3.0,"I am a long time customer of Flexogen.  However, they have changed something in their hose production, maybe less layers, maybe a softer plastic compound, but the hose that is not suppossed to kink does.  I still love our hose and it doesn't kink as bad as less expensive ones, but it does kink.  Wish it was the same as the ones I purchased ten years ago."
4.0,"Gilmour hit a home run with this hose. Very nice and durable. Lightweight. It will kink but very rarely and only if you don't take normal precautions such as removing twists in the hose. Its really great at letting you get a full flow of water going. Large diameter connectors do not restrict flow as in some hoses. What good is it to have a 5/8"" hose if the connector is only 1/2"" in diameter? I think you'll like this hose if you order it. I like mine."
5.0,"I've a great big landscaped yard.
I own nearly a quarter mile of hose of almost every description.  I've gotten good service from almost every brand - but only consistently good service from two;  Craftsman all rubber,  and Gilmore Flexogen.  Ergo,  those two are all I buy anymore.
I'm obsessively intolerant of leaks anywhere.
The Flexogen hose is the lightest and easiest to handle hose I own.  The Craftsman may be a tad more durable,  but being black,  gets a bit warm in the hot sun.
I'm sure I'm at least partly wrong,  but most of the complaints I've read here sound more like operator head space and timing problems than a problem with the hose.  I've some over six years old and never had the need to test the guarantee.
To mitigate tangling problems with any hose, I suggest using 50' lengths and LR Nelson's Brass Quick Connectors (I also gave 5 stars).  Further,  I discourage tugging on a hose to get to that ""last flowerbed.""  An extra section of hose is much cheaper than what the plumber is going to charge to replace broken hose bib pipes.  I always leave a little loop of hose next to the bib and won't allow myself to pull hard enough to remove the loop.
If you place any hose on concrete and run over it,  sooner or later,  it will fail.  I don't treat my stuff that way.
I just ordered two more Gilmore Flexogen hoses from Amazon to replace another brand that age has made a bit brittle.  Good price,  free shipping.  What's not to like?"
5.0,"this is my second purchase of this same hose, which pretty much says it all. i bought the first one two or three summers ago, and it has worked so well for me, i decided to purchase another. this is one of the finest hoses i've ever used. it is flexible, yet sturdy, and it never kinks. well worth the money and deserving of five stars."
4.0,"I like this thing, it's a little finicky when the hose crosses over the path of the unit."
5.0,Amazing lawn sprinkler set it and forget it. We have a huge yard 2 acres couldn't do it without it.
5.0,No more going out to my yard and moving my sprinkler 20 times in three hours!
5.0,Next best thing to an underground sprinkler
5.0,Works great
5.0,I've seen these over the years but never had a need for one until now. I have about a 150 foot long strip of grass that would require many many sprinkler repositionings to cover. This works like a charm and is so fun to watch. My neighbor is very enamored with it too. It seems very well made out of heavy guage steel and weighs more than it looks. I guess it needs to be heavy to have enough traction to drag nearly a hundred feet of hose.
5.0,Well built and HEAVY. Does a great job watering the lawn. Its great to be able to set it and forget it while you are busy.
5.0,Only used it a couple of times so far but am extremely satisfied. Awesome that I get to water large chunks of grass without having to move the sprinkler. And it shuts off. Exciting!
5.0,"I love mine I have had it for over 2 years and no problems. It goes up hill, down hill, and side hills with no problem what so ever. Just don't expect it to make sharp turns. well worth the $60.00 we paid for it."
1.0,"Did my research before purchase.  I am over 60 GPM (about 65), even with washing machine on.  I recd. unit today and the sprinkler arms or unit do not move.  Very disappointed.  Returning and purchasing Orbit.  No second chances, Nelson."
4.0,"Good quality,"
2.0,Worked well for the first few times then the blades seem to be out of adjustment and or dull. Too bad I'm outside the return period.
4.0,Great and easy and comfortable!
5.0,They work great!  Would recommend to others.
5.0,"product feels good, time will tell"
4.0,I find that these shears cut very well. I am still interesting a smaller size.
2.0,"These work okay on anything <= 1/4 inch and anything <1/2 that is crisp but not woody (green stem growth). On woody plants, the blades separate. On stringy plants, they cut 90% of the way through and cause the bark to strip."
3.0,"Product appears to be made well, however, after minimal use, blades begin to dull.  Possibly, steel is not hard enough.  This is the second pair I've purchased.  Probably try another brand next purchase."
5.0,"great pr of shears, nice feel to the handle, very effective cutting, great lock while not in use, would buy again."
5.0,"These shears are great for getting all the little branches, stems, anything that needs pruning in the flower beds, etc."
1.0,Leaks water the whole time you use it.
5.0,This is a must-have if you have a yard or garden.  Takes the guesswork out of measuring.  Excellent quality.
5.0,I love this sprayer.  As a 63 year old female this will come in very handy for spraying my trees this spring.
5.0,These things are great time savers for applying pesticide to yards
5.0,good product
5.0,Excellent and handy sprayer.  I have used this type and brand for years but it seems like the nurseries don't carry that exact kind any more.  That is why I ordered it from Amazon when I saw it there.
4.0,"works fine, but nothing great for the price. doesn't spray perfectly even. It worked for what I needed. Don't know how long it will last."
5.0,easy to use
5.0,Have not used it yet but ir seems to be of high quality and should last a long time.
5.0,Works great.  Is much easier to use than the one it replaced since no pre-mixing of chemicals is required.  Results using it so far have been great.
2.0,"Was very slow on the high setting so would over water the lawn and took an extremely long time to water the lawn.
I used the recommended size hose and water pressure is strong."
2.0,"Well, I bought it for both watering the grass and looking fun. Woke up the next morning and I had friggin corn growing where my lawn used to be..."
5.0,I like this product because it works. Waters every place I need watered.
1.0,"Fun to watch, but lasted about 2 hours. Made it about 45' on a 50' hose."
5.0,Great
5.0,Great product and works perfectly!  Great for watering a large area.
5.0,great design and steady build.  Love the idea and concept.  Working well so far.
5.0,"This product is great quality a big hunk of metal that works well on hills, bumpy lawns and whatever else. I am amazed with this product I would recommend to anyone that doesn't want to move a sprinkler 10 times a night to water there lawn."
5.0,Works really good.  You don't have to go out to move your hose.
5.0,"The Nelson 1865 Raintrain is the latest edition of this sprinkler reflecting decades of simple and elegant design.  I remember seeing these a young kid thinking they were a cool idea.  Now I own one.  While it will never compete with the convenience of an in-ground irrigation system, it will run for hours without intervention and shut itself off at the end of its trip through your yard.  Simple to use and effective.  Combine it with a good quality 5/8"" hose about 100' long and you'll have a nice setup for watering your yard with minimal effort."
1.0,I bought a 50 foot flexogen hose. It is easily the most expensive hose I ever bought. Also it is the worst hose I ever bought. Water comes out everywhere except where I need it.
4.0,"Don't use the hose too much but it has worked well so far.  Beware, tho --I bought 100' to go into a Reel Smart and it wouldn't fit.  So had to switch to 75' purchased locally.  Also, the plastic ""anti-kink"" sleeve at the coupling doesn't work well with the connector on the Reel Smart and almost forces a kink, unless the entire hose is unwound."
3.0,"It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:

One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.

This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.

However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.

I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one."
4.0,I do like this for the main reason that it does not crack or get dried up and old if you leave it out to brave the weather elements.  I have to run a hose year round to my water pump around the house and the ones I used to use did not last long.  This Gilmour is flexible and does not kink up easily like garden hoses I have used in the past.  I think I got more than my monies worth this time around with this product.  Thanks Gilmour!
3.0,"This flexogen hose is not as flexable at cold temps as my other ones. Did they change how they are manufactured??????
 Hose is still going strong ! Great product 4/2008"
5.0,"When they say ""if you have a problem with your Flexgen hose, simply cut off both ends and send them post paid, along with your name, address, and length of the hose to Gilmour, and they will send you a new one free"" they really mean it. I received a new replacement hose in ten days. They even paid UPS charges!"
2.0,"Not sure what my title has to do with anything...

Nonetheless, here's the scoop on this hose. I live in sunny, SUNNY southern Cal. I owned the hose for approximately 3 weeks when I noticed two 3""-5"" incisions, about 10 feet from each other, on the shell (external portion) of the hose. So, I cut the ends off, wrote a note, slipped everything in an envelope and waited to see how fast the replacement would arrive. Including shipping, it took Gilmour about 2 weeks to send me the replacement. What frustrated me was the SASE postcard they included asking me what had happened. Um... did you not read MY NOTE???

Gilmour states this about their hose: ""It'll be the last hose you'll ever own."" I chuckled at that quote and included it in my mailed explanation of what happened. There are two ways one could look at this quote. 1) We suckered you into buying this thing and you'll never need to buy another one because each time it breaks down (which will be once a year), we'll merely send you a replacement--until we go out of business. Or, 2) Our product is so great, there will never be a problem with it for the entirety of your life.

Conclusion: if you live in the desert, keep your hose in the shade. Shade... desert... get it???  This hose is quite malleable and doesn't tangle easily. But, it does ""stick"" to itself--something to do with the material of the hose's shell, is my assumption. The ends are wonderfully reinforced and the weight to the hose is far less than any standard hose I've used in the past. But then again, those hoses didn't deteriorate from the sun in 3 weeks. Buy at your own risk. With the lifetime warranty, you can't really lose...."
5.0,Sturdy and flexible as advertised. Seems hole-resistant. Doesn't kink when wound up.
2.0,"I bought this hose from Amazon on a clearance sale for

something like $10.  Really cheap!

I received it and I was very impressed... sturdy, thick, and by far the heaviest hose I've ever seen.

It didn't tangle easily and I loved it.

Then problems occured.

1) It was so heavy that it tore the hose hanger from my house in the back yard.

2) it started to leak at the connections on *both* ends.

I cut the hose shorter with a knife and attached my own hose ends from the hardware store and it works great now, but it should have lasted years before it leaked."
4.0,"This is a great hose- it almost never kinks on me.  It is pretty heavy though and sometimes harder to lug around.  I also bought a craftsman hose that is much lighter duty.  That hose often kinks on me, stopping the flow of water- which can be very annoying.  But, it's also lighter and easier to manipulate, and about half the price.  That said, the flexogen is a very good hose, and I'm happy with it."
4.0,Much better than the old pump sprayers. Very well made with quality materials.
3.0,"Works nicely, but the filter screen gets easily clogged when I apply pesticides."
3.0,I still like the ortho sprayer better.not enough settings
3.0,"Not great. I was trying to replace some of the plastic sprayers I have lost in a move... this seemed to get good reviews but really it lacks several things. The bottle seems smaller than the others, fine... the ""fan"" nozzle is a joke. Spray distance is lacking since you can't do anything to really adjust (fan... or no fan... or upside down fan... those are your options). It works... so 3 stars... but I'm going back to plastic next time."
2.0,"I would have given a better rating, but when spraying out castor oil(to keep the moles away) the opening(set at max open) is still too small and takes forever and a lot of water to empty the bottle. Perhaps other applications work well, but not castor oil."
5.0,Unbelievable .... this is all you need for most all the chores to do outside.  I don't even use my power washer anymore. Everyone should have one of these.  It spray a long distance and you can wash your house and roof with it.  Very well made and I just love it.
5.0,"Nice durable sprayer. Great for liquid products, such as weed killers. More work, if you are using a crystallized product, such as Miracle-gro lawn food. You have to mix it with water and strain it through a paint strainer, which you can buy on the cheap at Home Depot. You have to use a different setting for this than for a liquid. Thing is, they give you good instructions on how to do it, in the booklet that comes with it. It's very durable and accurate. You can turn the tip on the front to spray up or down. I read a ton of complaints about Miracle-gro sprayers, before I bought this one. Not disappointed."
5.0,looks just like my old one and works like the old
5.0,They May not be making these much longer so I bought Two!
1.0,"I hate using this sprayer.  It's difficult to fill - because of the very small opening, you need to use a funnel.  It's awkward attaching it to a hose - you need to spin the entire apparatus around and around until it's secure enough so it doesn't leak.  The bottle is too small to hold chemicals that require a higher dilution rate."
4.0,"We got this for our old house which didn't have a sprinkler system.  Our neighbors had one and we were so fascinated by the concept we had to get one to try, especially for days when we were going to be out for a long time and weren't able to constantly move a standing sprinkler.

The cart is propelled by the pressure of the water flowing through it.  It has spiked wheels to give it traction in the lawn - they're not terribly sharp, but can be bothersome.  The 'arms' are adjustable (rotate on the x-axis so they point up, down, left, right, etc) to change the speed of rotation, how far the water goes, how fast, etc.  There is a small plug in ""hill"" that serves as a stopper for the cart.  This is plugged into the grass with a metal stake.

I found this great for a light sprinkling, but for things that needed more, steady watering, one pass was not efficient.  It is not going to work for odd shaped areas, since this is effectively a large moving circle of water.

For what it does do, as long as you are aware of it, it does it very very well."
1.0,Just arrived and it does not work - it's expensive crap.  I will be returning this item
5.0,"We have had this watering tractor by nelson for the past 14 years with no issues. This year the water spinning mechanism froze up and won't spin on its own power any longer. The price I paid back in 2002 was also 100$, so it was a nice surprise to see that competition of other sprinkler tractors have made the price come down a bit."
5.0,These will not disappoint.  Would be a great Father's Day gift.... I have one and now buy them as gifts for clients and they LOVE em!
5.0,This is an alternative to a high-maintenance sprinkling system.  Large areas can be watered with little effort.  It's also fun to watch the heavy tractor creep along.
5.0,great product
5.0,Works great.  Heavy duty.
5.0,Exactly what I needed works great. Keeps me from going out and moving sprinkler
5.0,Simply the best way to water your lawn and gardens!
4.0,"I've had a fairly good experience with the Nelson 1865 raintrain traveling sprinkler.  This sprinkler should be considered by anyone who has a relatively large yard without a built in irrigation system. This sprinkler is also very useful to those that are tired of relocating a stationary sprinkler to different parts of the yard every hour or so.  Lastly, you'll want this system if you prefer to get the most coverage without wasting unnecessary amounts of water.  I've used the sprinkler for about a week straight.  It has done what it was intended for; watered my entire yard within a few hours, without requiring me to relocate a stationary sprinkler.

I'm only giving the sprinkler four stars because there is a little too much trial and error needed to get the sprinkler setup properly and operating efficiently. One example of this would be knowing how much hose you need to meet the requirements of the sprinkler. The sprinkler instructions tell you to have a big 3 foot loop at the back of the sprinkler to avoid kinking. Another example is that you also need enough hose to allow for large turns, if necessary to cover your yard.  If you need the sprinkler to make a turn, but the way you lay out the hose does not allow that turn to be wide enough, the sprinkler will end up off the hose and stuck in place or turned over, pooling water or spraying water where you don't intend for it to go.  It is due to these requirements that I needed to buy a new hose that was double in length to the hose I used prior. It might be laziness speaking, but for the convenience of having a traveling sprinkler, it is time consuming to have to go out and reset the hose layout before each run of the sprinkler. The hose layout does not remain in place because the hose is attached to the back of the sprinkler. Therefore, the sprinkler pulls the hose behind it. The pulling and necessary resetting of the hose is understandable, but time consuming and not convenient. If you water your lawn daily or multiple times per week, you'll be resetting the hose each time. I guess it is still a better option than standing outside with the hose or relocating a stationary sprinkler. The last reason I'm giving the sprinkler four stars is because it is slower than I expected. There are three speed settings: low, high, and neutral. On high speed the sprinkler still crawls along slowly, until it gets to the stopping point, which is normally five to ten feet before the spigot.

In conclusion, I think the benefits outweigh the negatives of the sprinkler.  I'm going to be purchasing another sprinkler for another part of my yard, which the sprinkler I have now is unable to get to due to the layout of my property.  Unfortunately, I'll have to buy a nearly 200 foot hose, if I can find one, to cover the entirety of the yard."
5.0,These pruning shears are sturdy and have nice sharp blades. They have a locking feature and are very easy to use.
5.0,"I purchased these shears, because I like Fiscar products and I needed a new pair anyway. I had a previous version that had the devo hat, springy thing between the handles and hated them because they got stuck in the closed position after a while. I've been using this pair for about one month now and love the quick release button. Makes me feel like a ninja with a pocket knife when I release the shears to open. They open effortlessly and smartly. They are super sharp out of the box, like the brand is known for. They do exactly, what I hoped for them to do. I would buy again."
5.0,"Good product. Easy to operate, yet hard for kids to unlock.
Good non-slippery handle and sharp edges. Pruning made easy
Would recommend."
5.0,I was astounded at the capability of these shears.  They just snip branches up to a half inch thick with no trouble at all.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"Very sharp,  cut easily."
1.0,Received one of these. Ordered 2.
5.0,Garden tools have to work and do the job at-hand. Fiskars fit the bill and are easy to use.
1.0,"I bought this for carrying with me while fishing back wood pools and hunting.  I run into thorny vines aka saw brier and the like often often.  Safe to say I didn't use this tool heavily at all.  First impressions were poor to begin with.  Most of the metal was pot metal to begin with.  But I didn't return it thinking Fiskars may have cut some corners but maybe not every single one.

After a few days of light use it seemed to cut okay.  Then after a few days I really had to clamp down to get it to cut small branches. I looked at the edge and noticed it has started curling.

I couldn't believe that they didn't even bother to harden the blade edge.  DON'T bother with this tool unless you're pruning onions.  Sadly this is not the quality that the Fiskars brand once offered."
4.0,"cuts good, but I kinda wish it was a little more substantial."
5.0,"I have used so many name brand hoses and the Flexogen is by far the most hassle-free and least frustrating hose I've come across. It doesn't kink (this is my number one frustration!), survives wild temperature changes, lasts for years, and winds easily. This is the only hose I use now. I have 8 of them and highly recommend the Flexogen."
1.0,"I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee. After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - ""Flexogen"". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.
Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.

Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.

On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say ""This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee"". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement."
1.0,"Inside label reads...""WARNING, This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING""
 Now go water your vegies and fill up your kids pool with it...I wont!!!"
5.0,"I bought a couple 20 years ago, and they are as good today as they were then. I've bought a few other brands of hoses too, but they lasted only a few years. If you spread their price over the years, these hoses are actually cheaper. They are also more reliable. I often keep them under pressure for months without ever having a blow out. I own about 10 of them now. Nothing else."
2.0,"Saw this hose mentioned in Real Simple magazine and thought it must be great after such a positive review.  Let me tell you -- it is not worth the expense.  The male fitting leaks all around.  It's also clunky and does not recoil well.  Hoses from Target are much more reliable, cheaper and even look nicer."
5.0,"The Gilmore ""Flexogen"" hose began life with Gates Rubber almost 35 years ago. Gates got out of the garden hose business about the same time they stopped making automobile tires; leaving themselves in a better position to focus on their belt business where they've dominated for decades. We still have a nearly 30 year old Gates version of this hose and I've purchased several Gilmore's as well. I wouldn't keep buying `em if they weren't the best!"
5.0,"I dunno what the folks that rated this hose poorly bought, but it can't be one of these Flexogen hoses.  I've had two fifty-footers for several years now, and they are the best, bar none, that I've ever owned.  In warm weather, it's like working with a soft rope, they're so flexible, and even in the dead of winter it's still flexible, unlike the plastic ones that crack and split.  Full flow, won't kink, abrasion- and cut-resistant.  I love 'em."
2.0,"Two months of use on this ... Flexogen hose and it developed  balloons in two places. One place sprang a leak. Had to replace. Rather than risk this again, unpgraded to ... commercial grade,( which intererestingly  carries no warranty at all.)"
1.0,This bargain hose is no bargain...it split within a few weeks of purchase...unruly to control.  Don't bother...some things you just shouldnt purchase online!
5.0,Great product!
5.0,It worked very well. Easy to use and no leaks.
5.0,"I have used this a lot for spraying and works very well! No leaks,no hassle. Just clean and reuse as necessary!"
5.0,Measures right.
5.0,"South Texas skeeters have been spotted flying off with small children. Not on my watch!

Seriously, this past season I was able to decimate the mosquito population around our home for a fraction of the cost of buying hose-end bug spray ready to use from the big box hardware stores.

Tip : You will lose the teaspoon reducer for the intake. Dont panic. Both Amazon and Gilmour have replacement (repair) kits.

Fantastic product. Clean it after use and I can see this tool lasting for years!"
5.0,"This is the easiest sprayer I have ever used.  I especially like the fact that it doesn't dilute what you put into the bottle.  That way if you don't need it all, easy, put it back in the original bottle.
  I thought I'd be put off by the price at first, but it works so well, I have no problem with the price.
  I also like that you can easily remove the deflector and spray high into the trees to get those pesky bagworms."
5.0,"Don't know how i did without it, i have always used a tank sprayer but never again. Items needs a swivel at the base of the nozzle where the hose hooks on. Hose has a tendicie to work loose and you get wet."
5.0,"Really better than anything that I tried from Lowes, works perfectly."
5.0,works great
5.0,"The hands down, best garden sprayer I have found. It can spray thick Atrazine and that means it can spray anything. That stuff always clogs my Ortho and it sprayed easily from the Gilmour. It rinses clean and is easy to hold with the trigger handle. No leaks and no deterioration after a year of heavy use. Good Stuff I highly recommend."
5.0,We had one of these for many years and finally it broke. So sad! This is exactly the same and we love it! Heavy quality and works wonderfully! If I could give it more stars I certainly would!
5.0,Have used traveling sprinkler for 35 + years . The Traveling Sprinkler has been effective for our lawn and garden. They are easy to use and maintain.
4.0,Bought this for my in-laws who do not have a sprinkler system. Saves them a lot of time and hassle not having to move a stationary sprinkler. Their only complaint is the spray will splatter dirt from the flowerbeds. Otherwise very happy!
4.0,"Arrived quickly. The product works as promised. The only problem we had was the water sometimes pushes the sprinkler out of the hole and we have to lower the water pressure. It would be nice if the two sprinkler pipes could actually screw into the holes instead of just pushing the pipes in. It goes very slow but it does its job. It takes 4-6 hours to water our full front lawn but I like this sprinkler system. We have to use about 300 feet of water hose so that's probably why it takes so long to water our whole front yard. To speed it up, I go out and move the water hose so the ""train"" doesn't have to pull so much of the water hose behind it. It tends to slow it down. Once you figure out the path you need and lay the water hose, your work is done until you have to pull the water hose back in. Great product."
5.0,This Sprinkler covers my whole yard in 1 watering...the Best!
5.0,"Works very well and has 2 speeds which is very nice to use.. Follows the hose well and has not jumped free.  The auto Turnoff works perfectly. No problems with gears yet, Have used it for watering every 3 days on large 1 acre tract and turn it on with 150' of hose and no problems except when going over bare dirt and it gets stuck. But keep it on the grass and super ."
4.0,"Love this traveling sprinkler. It does a great job of really soaking the lawn and covers a very wide area. Only downfall, as noted by other reviewers, is that it doesn't do a very good job making turns. I had to babysit my Raintree traveling sprinkler every time I used it which kind of took away the idea of a worry free product. I'm almost better off using a traditional sprinkler considering the amount of babysitting needed for my application, which does involve making a long sweeping turn."
2.0,"BETTER TO GET AN UNDER GROUND SPRINKLER SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE A LARGE ORCARD LIKE I DO.  THE TRACTOR IS VERY HEAVY TO LIFT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TO CARRY IT VERY FAR.
PERFECT IF YOU ARE USING IT IN YOUR FRONT YARD ON A MANICURED LAWN.  IT TAKES ABOUT 3 HOURS FOR IT TO RUN THE LENGTH OF THE HOSE.
I DID A LOT OF READING UP ABOUT IT AND EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO BUY REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR IT.  IT HAS GEARS IN IT THAT OFTEN GET STRIPPED.  IF YOU ARE HANDY WITH MAKING REPAIRS LIKE THAT THEN THIS IS FOR YOU.
I HAVE BEEN USING IT IN MOSTLY SAND AND IT DOES THE JOB BUT LIKE A SPRINKLER SYSTEM I STILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND MOVE IT EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS.  I HAVE TO CHECK IT EVERY 30 MINUTES TO MAKE SURE IT HASN'T GOTTEN TRIPPED UP AND STOPPED WORKING BECAUSE IT SUNK INTO THE SAND OR RAN OVER A STICK.  IT IS A PAIN IN THE BUTT, I CAN'T JUST SET IT OUT AND FORGET IT."
5.0,"This seems to work quite well on a new lawn. It does ""walk"" as described and doesn't overwater."
5.0,I have a pretty big yard and no sprinkler system for 5 years I have been moving the sprinkler! This is my new best friend. :0) This thing is such a time saver and cute to boot. Some of the best money I have spent it works just like is should and I LOVE IT.
1.0,Cheap made. Horrible product. Won't cut but half the time. Buy a different brand - this one is no good.
5.0,Sharp and easy to use one handed.
5.0,Works good and good price!
1.0,Broke first time I tried to cut something. Not very well made.
5.0,great item
5.0,"Used it to even cut some small branches, works great"
5.0,excellent.  Strong and heavy duty.
1.0,"My wife just bought a pair of these. Third cut, and the blade gouged itself against the part it is supposed to ""bypass"". I had to take a file and file down a bunch of metal just to get them to function again. These are junk. Save your money."
5.0,"Getting another pair as I like these so much. I saw another one with longer, thinner blades, must have.  lola"
5.0,Good. Light works. Will buy again
5.0,Works as advertised.
5.0,First one appeared used with some chemical... Second one is great
5.0,Sweet tool good price
5.0,Works great!
5.0,Use this sprayer to clean my horse. Simply add some Dawn dish soap and spray away. My horse loves to have his bath from time to time.
5.0,excellent item it does the job so good .
5.0,loved it it so much easier than a drop spreader
5.0,Stretch out your fertilizer with more widespread coverage.
5.0,This sprayer really works great. By removing the diffuser this sprayer really sprays 30 feet. I used this sprayer to clean  my roof with high pitchs. Great product.
5.0,"This is a huge time saver. I use it for weed control products such as weed killer or grass killer. The instructions describe how to flush after use, but also clean the outside after use. Mine corroded on the ouside, but still works well."
5.0,"For those without a sprinkler system, this traveling sprinkler makes watering a lawn a much easier project."
3.0,"Sprinkler works well enough but the arms keep coming loose and requires frequent adjustment for proper water distribution.  Am wary of tightening too tight as I do not want to to strip adjustment.  Also,  the paint job is a little on the cheap side; less than a full season of use and it has already faded considerably into a very pale yellow. A minor point,  but points to overall quality of workmanship. If I pay a high price for an item, I expect a high level of quality!"
4.0,Seems well built. I have not yet gotten to try it as its rained 80% of the days since purchase. Maybe that's a perk of buying this thing? Lol.
5.0,"This little machine is must have for anyone who wants to water even a small yard.  Set it and check on it in few hours watering done.  I like the fact it shuts its self off most of the time but not always so I keep an eye it just in case it needs help.  I love not having to set a timer and move the sprinkler every few hours,  this is freedom!  Try it if you  don't Love it  return it,  I bet you will Love it and keep it.  No I don't have any connection to Nelson,  I have just been using these sprinklers for over 22 years and love the product."
5.0,great product
3.0,"Don't bother using on a new lawn. If you only have top soil and seed, it will push all of your seed and fertilizer out away from the sprayer leaving bare mud. In addition, it ends up just getting stuck in the mud. Only use on an established yard/grass."
5.0,"I like the way it is made so you can buy and replace the motor section. I had a different make and when the parts wore out you were lucky to find them,,,"
1.0,"We purchased for a new lawn.  Because of the mud and hay, it did not travel very well.  I expect that it will work once our lawn is established."
5.0,The next best thing if you cannot afford a sprinkler system!
5.0,Worked until my wife hit it with our tractor.
3.0,I hate to say this but it is just not sharp enough
4.0,"Good clippers/pruners. The Gelindo pruning shears are better because they align top and bottom blade to make the cut. Still, not a bad product for the price."
4.0,"Broke last pair after 15 years. Work well, good grip."
5.0,"Very nice pruning shears!  I've had 'em all over the years.  These work and work well.  In addition, the blade lock is within the unit, not on the outside held by a screw which will fall off.  Very pleased."
5.0,Quality pruning shears at a great price.  Fiskars is a great name in all cutting utensils.
5.0,Good quality shears.
5.0,"These are really nice shears. Sharp blade, cuts limbs very easily. Happy with my purchase."
5.0,These cut very well.
5.0,They work great.
5.0,These are great! They are very sharp and sturdy.  I've used these on heavy limbs and tender roses.  Very nice.
5.0,great
1.0,"I was very unhappy with this purchase. I have to honestly say I am not sure it is because our water pressure is low, but it would not mix and dispense any fertilizer{mircle grow liquid}. I don't know if I got a bad one, or what, but I know in my x-profession of interior landscape maintenance these were the best things out there."
5.0,"Works perfectly! Easy to use, easy to set up for the proper dispensing amount, and easy to clean. 3 easys= GREAT!"
5.0,"I was looking for a hose end sprayer and could not find any locally that were made of metal.  Everything was plastic, and had horrible reviews.  I found this model during a google search and noticed Amazon carried it.

THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!  I used it to spray some creeping weed killer, and it made the job exponentially easier!  I previously had used a pump sprayer and it took forever.  With this product I was able to get great coverage in less time.

I have lent it to a friend who needed to kill all his grass, and he too was extremely happy with the sprayer.  Saved him a bunch of time too!"
1.0,The hose connection did not have threads and was not usable.  Had to go through annoying return policy.  What a pia.  And waste of my time.
2.0,"this is not as intuitive as the old and basic ortho one.
Not impressed with the nozzle, not the balance"
5.0,works great
2.0,"I was really disappointed with this item.  It leaks at the connection from silver sprayer to the black washer.  In order to turn the flow off, I couldn't just let go of the sprayer.  Upon turning the water pressure on, the hose sprayed everywhere until I used a lot of force to uncompress the handle for the sprayer.  Maybe I received a defective item, but I don't care for this."
4.0,Good product. Only con is the size of the hopper. Could be larger.
5.0,Gilmour only makes exceptional products. It is the same as my previous one except made of plastic base instead of glass so it won't break.
5.0,"Set it and forget it, waters wonderfully."
5.0,Bought a couple of these so I could water front and back yards at the same time. Was planning to have a sprinkler system installed eventually but may not need to now. These things are awesome. Well-built and saves me from having to keep moving sprinklers around.
3.0,"I have gone through three of these. They are a good time saver in that I do not need to keep moving it as often, but it does need attention. The wheels can dig in in softer soil and it gets stuck. The bigger problem is that the plastic drive gearing inside gets stripped out and I cannot get anyone to sell me replacement parts. I would much rather spend 15 bucks or so on parts to rebuild.
While the company claims it can travel up to 200 feet, that is what I think causes the stripped gears. When it travels that far, it is then hauling behind it the weight of 100' of hose and all the water that is in it, which is considerable, along with the friction involved.
If this had metal gearing, it would be a lifetime product, IMO"
5.0,Works terrific and very fun to watch.
3.0,"Great at the start, but motor sprockets broke right at the 2 year mark. We ran it last week and couldn't figure out why it wasn't moving, my husband took the back assembly apart to try to see what was wrong and the plastic sprockets in the motor area were stripped off. Great while it lasted, but wish it would have held up better."
5.0,Oh this baby makes watering your lawn fun.  It has been a over a month of using it now and I am very glad I got it.  It take a few tries to figure-out how to best layout the garden hose and adjust the arms to match my lawn.  Otherwise this sprinklers is worth the money and even fun to watch.
5.0,Rugged design and reliable. Have had for number of years and it continues to work great.
5.0,I purchased two of these Raintrain's and they did an incredible job or restoring my lawn and they work exactly the way the instructions claim.
5.0,"I've had mine now for 14 years.  I have had to replace the arms because the machine hasn't been ""coddled!""  It is propelled by the water pressure and the centrifugal force of the rotating arms  You can make the thing back up by flipping the angle of the arm direction 180*  I now use it on  my daughters yard as they don't have sprinkler system here.  Its eco friendly in that a minimum of water is wasted.....two speeds and with the ramp and a good hose, very predictable as to time and area.  The area can be enlarged by pulling the hose thru and redirecting the path.....I think it worth the $$.  Cant comment on the newer manufacturing complaint but as it stands now.... this will outlive me! ."
5.0,"This thing works.  I had qualms about it because I think I bought some look-alike long ago, somewhat lighter that was always ""going off the rails"" falling over or just generally malfunctioning.  My first outing with this, the little ramp to stop it turned over, so it went off the rails at the end.  Not a terrible problem as it completed its watering mission, but I found it past the end, tipped over & spraying.  Second time, with the little ""stop ramp thingy"" well-anchored, it performed flawlessly.  One critique is the few controls (e.g., ""fast"" vs ""slow"") could be labeled a bit better on the device, so you wouldn't have to refer to the instruction manual to set them.  But I'm nit-picking here.  This is a good product that performs as advertised for a modest price.  Two thumbs up!"
5.0,Fiskars work great. No problems.
5.0,I've purchased several of these over the years and they do a good job. Bought this pair for the lady doing my wedding flowers.
5.0,Great pruners for the price!
5.0,"Nice high quality bypass snips, comes in useful for harvest time. Gives clean cuts and no real need to sharpen as long as you don't abuse the blade."
5.0,My wife loves these.
5.0,Great Quality!
5.0,"These are in my hand all weekend. I am a garden putterer and these are awesome pruners. Comfortable, sharp, all purpose. Love 'em."
5.0,love it!
5.0,"GREAT Clippers!!!
Cut well even through hard woods like mesquite!!!"
4.0,It's  sharp
5.0,Best hose end sprayer on the market and great price.  I had been buying cheaper sprayers that in fact were not much cheaper and always struggled with them working correctly.  This one is solid construction and works great with everything so far.
5.0,"Solid design, good, even spray pattern, easy to use. Just what I needed."
3.0,I loved it until it broke.
5.0,Best hose end sprayer I have ever owned.
5.0,Worked as anticipated.
5.0,Does the the job.  Looks to be durable.
5.0,"Excellent product for my garden, no leaks, easy to manage as compared to other sprayers"
5.0,"Just awesome. This might be the case with other sprayers, but I like that I can put all the remaining product back because it's not diluted. Really like how it works. Cleaned out after as directed and worked great the next time."
5.0,No leak
4.0,"Easy to use! Used it to spray the house and deck with Spray and Forget. No mixing, no mess!"
5.0,"Heavy weight sprinkler moves itself, good product, auto shutoff"
5.0,I've had this same sprinkler now for 3 years and it has never failed. It was a good buy and still does the job!
5.0,Love this little tractor.  works great.
3.0,Tips over on any sort of incline and i have yet to find a solution other than putting some training wheels on it.
5.0,old technology but works extreemly well.  Work saver
5.0,Used it all summer long on a 2 acres of lawn and it did great. I kept the moving parts lubed and had no problems.
4.0,Solid build with great coverage....
5.0,Excellent lawn sprinkler
5.0,"It's REALLY SLOW, moving, perhaps, 10-ft in an hour if I recall correctly. Having said this, it is effective in tracking my 3/4-inch hose. I tried to use it in conjunction with the new Miracle Grow in-lin feeding system. The latter feeds much too fast to be used in conjunction with this sprinkler. Next spring, I will try to figure out a somewhat different approach to automatically feeding my gardens. This sprinkler appears to be really built to last a lifetime and well worth the money."
5.0,"Much better than a previous brand purchased (sprinkler was green in color). Very soothing to listen to the water hit the different bushes as the sprinkler travels through the backyard. The previous brand did not have enough power to actually pull the hose behind it. This one has plenty of force to keep it moving and on track, dragging the hose behind it."
5.0,Nice pruners. Clean cut.
5.0,very solid and easy to use.
1.0,These came bent and don't really work. To close and lock them I really had to bend them back in place.
5.0,Just what I needed!
5.0,"These bad boys trim the bush. Super sharp, super clean cuts, basically a dream tool."
4.0,Works well
5.0,Works great and handles all the pruning I need to do.
5.0,Finally a shears that will last! I'm tired of constantly having to buy replacements every year. This one will last for several years.
5.0,Helps my garden efficiently
5.0,Fantastic!
5.0,Good product. Very well build. Mine came out a bit higher than the setting but not a biggie. My only suggestion is it'd be great if the sprayer nozzle can have different pattern.
4.0,Just a bit top heavy but it works like a charm.
5.0,"I love these sprayers. They beat the heck out of any pump up sprayer any day. You end up using more material, but you get much better coverage. Also I have checked the mixture rate by filling a bucket from it and it's always right on."
4.0,good product
3.0,"Leaks out of a vaccum port at the top--makes a real mess, while losing expensive herbicide/pesticides. Functions well if you can keep it upright so it doesn't leak."
5.0,"Good sprayer, mine did not leak anywhere.  Main trouble with use is not the sprayer, but trying to decipher/infer/translate chemical-producer's dilution instructions in a way that makes sense.  They often want you to buy *their* branded/ labeled sprayers, and refer to some pre-dilution scheme indexed on their sprayer, rather than offering standard measures and ratios.  But this sprayer seems better made, and worked well, after I mulled it over and did some conversions."
5.0,"Got this for washing my house. After removing the black plastic novel, it sprayed water mixed with bleach to the gutters of my two story house without leaking one drop. I do have great water pressure, this worked better then my pressure washer. I look forward to using it for my lawn and pond chemicals."
5.0,"I have used this sprayer for a good while now, and it is the best one I've ever had!  No contest!  I've used about every hose-end sprayer made and they all clog up very easily. Not this guy.  It delivers the product to the plants in no time at all, clean up by washing and letting it dry completely, and it's ready to go the next time.
Hope to never have to use another brand hose-end sprayer again. Yeah!"
2.0,"I've used this model Gilmour hose-end sprayer and I've also used the model with the teal-colored handle.  This one costs a bit more, but it's worth the extra cash as both its construction and design is superior to its cheaper cousin.  For example, I found that the point of connection on the cheaper unit was a veritable Achille's heel ie as I walked, the hose tended work loose fairly easily and, of course, as soon as the seal was broken, I'd get an unwanted 'shower'.  That mishap didn't happen once when I sprayed my 1/2 acre lawn with the 362 Pro.  UPDATE: 2.17.17:  I paid $19 for this item 2.5 years ago & now it's going for $50??  If you want this type hose-end sprayer, check out the Chapin G362 model.  As far as I can tell, it's virtually identical to the Gilmour unit and is available for $20!!"
5.0,Works good
5.0,A little glitchy at first but works great as expected!
5.0,"We just built a new construction house and knew that we were going to have new sod...I was kind of hesitant at first, but ended up loving this after using just a couple times! Make sure to read the directions so you get setup correctly. The stop ramp is also nice for when I turn it on and leave home. It's built very sturdy and weighs more than you would think, Top-notch product."
4.0,my yard was not big enough...
5.0,"Problem: having to get up every 30 minutes to move a sprinkler for the better part of an entire day to water the lawn.
Solution: Setup the hose and attach one of these, turn on the water and go do something else.

It works really great, and it's heavy and sturdy (much heavier than I thought it would be).  I also thought there was no way this thing was going to pull a 100' hose full of water, but it does -- really well.  I will say, however, that it does start to slow down a bit the further it goes because of the weight of the hose.  I usually just loosen up the slack once it moves about 30-40 feet and it speeds right back up.

Great purchase."
4.0,saves time
5.0,Works great!!!!! No regrets!!!! No issues at all!!!!
3.0,"I only used this for couple of times, I am not able to get it to stop at the ramp."
5.0,Did a very good job
5.0,works! I'm very pleased and love to use it if we're short on rain
5.0,"I really love this sprinkler but keep the dogs away.  The two arms are very soft metal and will bend if not handled delicately.  Also, about once in 10 times it won't stop when it hits the stop device so I don't trust it for overnight use.  Distance adjustments are easy but take time. You have to keep turning on and off the facet unless you are ok with getting wet."
5.0,Great product.
5.0,"Awesome shears.  This is my third pair.  One for the house, one for the deer hunting backpack, and one on the four wheeler."
5.0,"Good quality, feels strong and well built. Balde is sharp."
5.0,"Tough set of clippers! I'm a bee keeper, and bought these snips to aid in removing swarms from trees... I needed quality snips that cut clean and easy, not ones that build up force from squeezing and chops (thus violently shaking the branch)... super sharp blade and perfect lever action is what you get with these snips... I've only used it on about a 7/8"" branch, but it cut it like butter on a hot day... easy enough to use to snip away delicate little branches as well... great product but that's what I've always come to expect from Fiskar products and they never disappoint..."
5.0,Practical tool for gardening.
4.0,"Nicely made, fair price"
5.0,good strong and sharp edges.
5.0,These feel good in the hand and feel like they are very good quality! Will certainly purchase this again.
5.0,great product
3.0,definitely not the quality of year gone by ---sent one back blades no lined up--was sent another and can say ---this will be my last Fiskars------this one does not cut worth damn
5.0,"Excellent product, easy to use"
4.0,"not a bad gadget - seems to spray OK but don't plan on mixing stuff in the reservoir because that is a joke.  mix outside and then funnel it in.  Boom.

better than a trip to the stupid orange box store."
5.0,"I love this sprayer.  It is finely engineered, with metal parts used for key components, works great, and has a lifetime guarantee. The spray pattern is very nice and even, and adjustable.  When the spray deflector is removed, you will get a powerful stream to reach 20 or 30 feet into trees (depends upon your water pressure).

The bottle is only 16 oz, which is smaller than some other products, but that is not a problem for me, and is a good tradeoff, to get a product that works so well.

I do recommend carefully reading the instructions that come with the sprayer, and you will avoid most of the issues seen in the lower rated reviews here."
4.0,This sprayer is arguably the best consumer version I've come across.  It's a well built and solid performer.  A suggestion for use would be to remove the teaspoon reducer and put it in a safe place - it has tendency to work its way free and fall off during use.  I am fairly satisfied with this product.
5.0,Great
5.0,Works great - quality product.
5.0,"Good product, and was delivered promptly."
3.0,"A good sprayer, I use it to wash cars before detailing. The sprayer is very sturdy and it is easy to do mixtures with accurate measurement. In order to get a more direct water flow, the sprayer tip is relatively easy to twist in any direction: up, down, left or right. Relatively good and received it very fast."
5.0,It is simple but seems to work.
5.0,Excellent product! Now I can spray the tops of the trees!
5.0,Works great travels the hose with no troubles.
5.0,I love these sprinklers. The only thing I don't like is that the small button on the underside is meant to shut off the water when it reaches the ramp. It is plastic and sometimes breaks. You have to replace the whole motor instead of being able to replace just that part. The motor is costly and it requires a bit more mechanical skill than I have to replace.  It is not hard to replace if you have the right tools but I don't have the right tools....
4.0,"The only problem I have had on several of these sprinklers, is that they uses plastic gears, and if it gets stuck on anything in the yard and cannot move, the gears will strip and it becomes useless.  I have lost three to this problem.  They need to start using Brass gears."
5.0,It works great. It's spray covers more area than we thought it would. You can sit and watch it move around your yard for a long time! It's mesmerizing! Lol
4.0,"Great way to water area's that are hard to get to. Instead of going through all the trouble of shutting things down and relocating a sprinkler,  as they say "" set it and forget it""."
5.0,I like my train
5.0,This works great! I have a huge yard and had some sod laid so I needed to water everyday for 2 weeks. It was taking me 4 hours to water. Every 20 minutes I had to go move the sprinkler: with this I hook it up and forget about it
5.0,Excellent product works as well as advertised. Very pleased
5.0,No stress lawn watering. Like having an automatic sprinkling system.
4.0,Nice addition to my back yard. Easy to set up just make sure hose is offset from the automatic shut-off clip at the base of the gear unit.
4.0,"Good cutters, a little stiff at first, but worked in well."
5.0,Fiskars is Always a Well Trusted brand to buy!
3.0,Not very durable. Tends to twist easily and this causes poor cutting results.
5.0,"These are great. Amazing how much more enjoyable gardening is with a new set of clippers. My old ones were dull, so these are a treat."
5.0,like it
5.0,These really work well.
4.0,Very good.
5.0,These are nice heavy duty clippers that seem like they will last for life.  A good buy for the bucks!
5.0,I had a pair of my own and this was on my daughter's wish list. They are great. Have some nice padding and are ergonomic. Make pruning a snap.
5.0,"EXCELLENT TOOL, STILL WORKING JUST GREAT"
3.0,Was just average.
4.0,Best pre mix sprayer I can find. The all plastic sprayers are junk.
5.0,"Works great for the two times I have used it.  I was really impressed with the bottle and that it was NOT a flimsy plastic.  I have no problem turning the adjustment dial at all.  Overall, 5 stars."
5.0,"This is great for mixing and spraying any type of cleaner with a particular ratio.  I haven't used it to clean coils yet, but it's in my future."
5.0,Tank sprayer would not work to spray up in the trees. I needed a light weight sprayer to spray high up in the trees and this works really well. Shipped to me fast also.
4.0,"Works great. I like it.
Thanks"
5.0,"easy to use, no waste"
4.0,"I purchased this after the neighbor lent me his to use. The no mixing feature is great compared to a wand/pump sprayer. Just dump in the chemical you want to spray, dial in the recommended application level, hook to the hose and go. The real beauty is clean up. Just dump the unused chemical back into the original container. No excess that is already mixed to figure out what to do with. The only downside is the amount of control you have when spraying. I used to to apply insecticide on my dwarf lime tree and it has so much pressure it sprays everywhere. A pump/wand sprayer is much lower pressure so you get better control. But for large sprays like the lawn or big garden it's quick and easy."
5.0,"Love this sprayer, have been using now for about a year to spray for weeds and bugs around my home.  I wash it out thoroughly with plain water after every use, and it hasn't clogged, and doesn't leak while in use.  The dial on top allows for exact mixing of product.  The directional spray control is okay, but not great.  This is the best one I have used, and I have gone through quite a few.  I am an avid gardner/yard maintainer, so these types of products are used extensively here, and this one by far is the best one I've used.  Hope it lasts a long time, but if something happens to it, I will definitely replace with same."
5.0,Awesome sprayer.  Be sure to run it clean after by putting fresh water in the reservoir and letting it run.  Overall I cannot complain.  Works great.
5.0,Everything I ordered has been superb!
1.0,"I've had three of these Nelsen traveling sprinklers. The gears are made of a cheap plastic (china) and wear out rapidly. I've purchased numerous gear sets from Nelson and they last approximately one year, and that's not a lot of use. Nor do I use more than a 100' hose. I recently purchased a traveling sprinkler by National. They are very expensive, but worth it to me to not have to jack with repairs every year.

[...]"
4.0,This thing beats having to walk around the yard and move my sprinkler all over the place. My yard is on a hill so sometimes it tips and i have to go out and fix it. It is pretty slow moving and takes a couple of hours to cover my yard which is probably about .2 acres. The product is heavy and well made and requires minimal setup. If you don't want to pay for a sprinkler system and don't want to move around a sprinkler in your yard this is the way to go.
5.0,Works the watering of my yard and entertains my young kids simultaneously.
5.0,"I am impressed so far with this sprinkler. It was easier to set up and use than I expected from reading the other reviews.  At first I laid out a complex course and adjusted the spray arms for a narrow pattern, but I soon realized I could use a shorter straighter line through the middle of the yard and adjust the arms for a wider pattern. The arms are easy to adjust by walking up to it and stopping them, then I twist them to get the angled end pointing as high or low as needed. When stopped adjust it to spray farther than needed because when spinning the water doesnt go as far. The distance will change some as it goes over small bumps and grass, unless you have a perfectly flat yard, so just set it for a happy medium. The only trouble I had so far was, one time I put too sharp of a turn at the end and the valve missed the shut off ramp."
5.0,Used all Summer without hitch!!!
5.0,very good
4.0,Works!
5.0,Makes watering the yard easy.. set the path you want the sprinkler to go and it waters without you having to watch it.  But it is fun to watch it work .. :)
5.0,I bought this sprinkler after seeing one in my neighbour's yard. Received an excellent price and delivery time was not too bad. It has worked exactly as advertised and was saving me water. We are now under water restrictions so it is parked for the rest of the year but I have no complaints. One thing to be aware of is it has to be on a grassy surface. Any bare or muddy spots and it will dig a hole quickly.
5.0,"I had a Gilmour 390 and struggled with it for a good year.  It sucked.  But it sucked because often it didn't suck.  Crappola, and all though the 390 is cheap, it is not worth the trouble.  Now, the 362. I could not stand the thought of buying another hose end sprayer from Gilmour after my experience with the 390, but I will say the 362 has worked perfectly.  I really have no way to check if the concentrated mixing is properly calibrated, but it seems okay.  If I had to guess, I may lean towards it being a little stronger than the setting.  Just speculation.

It sprays strong and after 20 plus uses, works as new."
5.0,Works extremely well - sprays 20-25 ft.
5.0,"Wow. A simple product that's actually well made. Brass and other metal plus a pro grade reusable bottle. Very nicely calibrated dilution settings and both tbs and tsp settings. Wash (and dry) the thing out between uses and I'm guessing I'll last years. Plus it has an unlimited warranty.
Oh and it's only a buck or two more then the all plastic even dorkier models."
5.0,"received the product yesterday,
Using it as replacement for FullerBrush window cleaning sprayer, which recently died on me after 20 years.
Washed the outside windows and car  using the sprayer.
It works extremely well, as described.
I highly recommend it!

Using it as replacement for FullerBrush window cleaning sprayer, which recently died on me after 20 years."
5.0,"I am so happy that I found this sprayer. I had bought this same sprayer years ago from a nursery and loved it but did not clean it out as good as I should have and it become clogged. I think I actually left some product in the bottle and tube, so shame on me. I had looked for it at different places and could not find this same sprayer so I have been using other sprayers that I have not liked as much.  I did a search the other day for sprayers and it popped up on Amazon and I bought it right away.

This sprayer is so convenient with being able to fill with whatever product you want to spray and dial up the dilution.  Any left over product can be returned to the original bottle since there is no mixing of the water with the chemical.  So easy to use and has great range with the spray and you can switch to spraying up for trees or down for plants.

Make sure you read the instruction booklet for use and clean the sprayer after each use. For those that say it leaks, yes it does but that is the anti back syphon (SP?) feature that prevents the chemicals from being sucked into your water hose. So it is suppose to leak a little depending on your water pressure. It is not the chemicals coming out so it should be ok and once you know that is how it works, it does not seem to be a big deal.  It is only a once sentence comment in the instruction booklet, so easy to miss this fact.

Also the sprayer uses a tube inside the bottle and has a brass attachment that converts from tablespoons to teaspoon that is screwed on top of the sprayer head for storage. When I opened the box after shipping, this part fell out but I was able to find it. So be careful not to miss this part. It is only about a half inch long and could be easily lost if not properly attached on top. Losing this does not prevent you from using the sprayer, just from converting to the lesser teaspoon ratios. When converting to teaspoons,the piece fits inside the tube inside the bottle to narrow the amount coming through the head. Otherwise, as said, it is stored on top.

The instructions say that the sprayer is designed for spraying items that are a similar consistency to water. So if something is a powder or thicker liquid you will have to dilute to make sure that it flows correctly and does not clog. The instructions talk about how to do this so that you still get the correct spraying ratios of chemical. I have a Miracle Grow sprayer that I use separately for that product since it has larger crystals.  But if you have a liquid or dissolve the Miracle Grow, it should still work.

Once last thing: I did notice this time around that the box has a warning about the sprayer containing lead which I imagine they are required to disclose. It says that you should wash your hands after handling and not put in your mouth.(HA!) I would say that about any product that you use to spray chemicals.  If you are spraying any chemical such as pesticide you probably should use gloves anyway and certainly not put in your mouth.

I definitely would recommend this product."
1.0,Terrible product a waste of $20 worth of makes one for the same amount of money that you can pick up at Home Depot and works great
5.0,this was to replace one that I had for over 10 years. Would be lost without it. Hope there still make if I need one in another 10 plus years.
5.0,"As of this date, I have only used it one time.  I was very pleased with the product, ease of use and the results from using it.  Would highly recommend it ."
3.0,"Not as impressed as most other reviewers. Main drawback for me is the barely acceptable spray pattern. I expected a nice wide, even, and consistant spray pattern. Instead it's more of a splash pattern which works off the nozzle shield(black thing up front). I do like that the pattern can be redirected. I also like the spray handle and brass hardware. The bottle is clearly marked in both oz's and ml's as well. Chemicals thicker than water must be pre-diluted accordingly and powders must be pre-mixed with water. You must also hold the sprayer upright or your chemical will leak out. Therefore it can't even be laid down if needed. I think the price is fair, but don't expect a professional experience as advertized."
5.0,"I really like this sprayer for my organic foliar applications.  It will get my fruit trees up high and it is so easy to use.  For my use, the screen is a little small but I really like the volume and spray that it puts out.  I have purchased several others that would not get to the tops of my trees or give the volume of mist that I need for my application."
5.0,"These are overkill for the super light pruning I need to do of indoor plants, but I bought them because Fiskars is a brand that I've had good experiences with in the past. I like that they have a safety lock."
5.0,"Easy to use, good tool"
3.0,Have only used pruners one time and that was for a very short time---Will let you know how they hold up once I've used them for a while---
5.0,Best shears ever for shaping and keeping shrubs trimmed.
5.0,These are great pruning shears!!
5.0,"works great, right out of the package and about 2 hours of pruning"
5.0,Excellent and indispensable for garden work.
4.0,use them a lot...work well
5.0,"I have used these shears a long time and find them perfect for my needs, plus my wife loves them."
5.0,Work great for pruning!
4.0,"So far so good, wish one of the speed settings was faster.  Appears to be of good quality, though plastic parts are a bit of concern."
5.0,we had been buying sprinklers at our hometown hardware stores and going through two or three of them a year.  and we'd run out there and get soaked moving them around.  this takes care of all of that for us and we love it!
5.0,"Works fine. Adjustable settings, functions perfectly"
5.0,This sprinkler has done a fine job.  Settings are easily changed and aligned correctly.....it just putters along.  Very happy.
5.0,Awesome sprinkler for the lawn.  Nice tha tit does the entire yard and i dont't have to move it.
5.0,"I purchased this for my (then) fianc in 2009. We didn't have an in-ground sprinkler system then, so we watered the yard with sprinklers. I remember being so excited about this one. My fianc and I sat out in front of the house for 3 or 4 hours talking and drinking beer and watching this guy make its way around the front yard, following the path of the hose. Now, 6 years later we still use this occasionally. The kids like to see it throwing water all over the yard. This sprinkler has spent the last 6 years outside in the brutal Texas summers (and occasional winter freezes) and although the bright yellow color has faded to more of a pastel yellow, the sprinkler still works just fine."
5.0,"It works perfectly and is the easiest way to thoroughly water your lawn with almost  no effort!  It's fun, too!"
4.0,It saves time on watering. And does a fairly good job.
4.0,"I've used this traveling sprinkler for about a month now, and overall it has worked as advertised and I'm favorable impressed. As others have previously noted, this is essentially a ""poor man's in-ground sprinkler system"". When used as directed, it does just what you'd expect it to do. The reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 stars is that there are some caveats to its use. During the past month, I've encountered a number of minor performance issues, which all were correctable, but issues nonetheless. As the manufacturer states, this traveling sprinkler is only intended for ""established"" lawns, and it will not work in newly seeded, bare dirt lawns-to-be. The reason is that the back wheels will dig into bare dirt and just slowly spin, meanwhile the sprinkler arms keeps spinning making the dirt even more wet and soft. This is a design engineering trade-off, as one could build in a number of features to prevent such action, but it would significantly increase the cost and complexity of the sprinkler. My lawn is long established, but still has some areas with minimal grass and sure enough, this traveling sprinkler has stalled in some of these areas. A related issue is that the 'stalling' issue (i.e., wheels spinning and no forward movement) is more problematic when the sprinkler is pulling more hose. My lawn area is long & narrow and so when the sprinkler is pulling 75+ feet of hose, and it begins to traverse a lawn area with minimal grass, then it is much more likely to stall. These issues are all addressable by simply becoming knowledgeable about one's lawn areas that are more likely to problematic and re-routing the hose and/or effectively minimizing the amount of hose that the sprinkler is pulling while traversing these areas. In summary, this is a good product for the money. It's also surprisingly fun to watch!

Update 1 year later (August 2016) - I've now gone through 2 watering seasons using this sprinkler and I continue to be a fan of the product. A couple of weeks ago, the drive mechanism failed, though I don't know the reason(s) why. In any event, I contacted Nelson, Inc. and they promptly shipped me a warranty replacement drive mechanism, which I installed. The replacement process is conceptually simple, though as others have noted (and there are good YouTube videos showing the specific replacement process), getting the wheels off the drive shaft can be challenging and time-consuming. However, once that is completed, then taking off the drive train assembly simply involves removing 5 screws and then exchanging the old assembly for the new and securing it in place (with 5 new screws supplied by Nelson). We are having another long, hot summer and the Nelson Raintrain sprinkler is keeping my lawn healthy and green. I recommend it!"
5.0,This is a great sprinkler for someone like me with a large lawn and not enough money to put in an underground system.  The simplicity of set up and operation is sheer genius.  At last a green lawn!
4.0,"I returned several all-plastic sprayers to Lowes and Home Depot before ordering this one from Amazon.  I've got to say that I have yet to experience the problems I had with those sprayers.  My only complaints are similar to other reviews: the lack of spray pattern options and the fact that it tips over when set on a flat surface.  The latter drawback and make it more difficult to get set up, but this minor inconvenience is much better than multiple trips to the hardware store to return defective items."
5.0,"Good item. Directions are a little unclear on how to change from tablespoons to teaspoons, but I did figure it out. The orifice is small and can easily be lost because it falls out from the tube. I did lose it and not sure how to get another one."
5.0,"OVERVIEW: This was purchased with Spectracide 95834 Weed Stop for Lawns. I am very happy with this product, first of all it is incredibly simple to use ('plug and play' if you will) I poured my solution in and was ready to go! It is fully adjustable but was already set up for the correct ratio that I needed. I hooked this up to my hose before filling it with the spectracide to make sure that it would work properly without leaking or spraying (please do this, you do NOT want to find that you have a faulty item while it's full of poison). All was well, and I was able to spray my yard quickly and effectively.

PROS: Works well and as advertised, No leaking, Quick and easy to use.
CONS: None that I have observed"
5.0,Just arrived and plainly this is a sprayer made to last many years. Looks like old fashioned quality materials and construction.  Has very useful instruction booklet and looks like individual parts may be ordered if need be. I have always had good customer service with Gilmour on the rare occasions it was needed. Wish I'd known about this sprayer sooner.
4.0,"I'VE TRIED DIFFERENT PRE-MIX HOSE SPRAYERS BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN SATISFIED WITH EITHER THE SPRAY PRESSURE OR DISTRIBUTION BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST ONE I'VE FOUND SO FAR.  IT DOES HAVE ONE MINOR QUIRK...IT SPRAYS IN A FAN / FLAT STYLE WHICH I LIKE BUT THE ANGLE OF THE SPRAY IS SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SPRAY A TALL HEDGE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR, IT'S KIND OF ACKWARD.  WITH THAT BEING SAID...IT'S STILL THE BEST HOSE SPRAYER I'VE FOUND."
5.0,Works great
5.0,"quality that you pay more for, but you are not constantly replacing. if using thicker liquids, dilute first and adjust your application rate accordingly."
5.0,works well
5.0,"I have used the gilmour sprayers for years, and when this one arrived I was very pleased to see that the quality of the sprayer has not been compromised.  The heavy weight plastic bottle is of excellent quality.  The sprayer and intake valve are great.  I get many years of usage out of one of these sprayers."
5.0,Excellent purchase; I use this sprayer all the time and love the ease of the design and the durability.  No drips and even  coverage.
4.0,I wish they hadn't chosen to replace the metal gears with nylon. Time will tell if it is as good as the original model I had years ago......
5.0,Great I love it
5.0,Amazing! You lay out the hose where you want the 'train' to travel while sprinkling and it does - all the way to the shut down that you set. Easy and great if you have large or small places that you want watered but you don;t want to watch it until the job is done.
5.0,"Does a great job watering back yard, plenty of coverage and the fast setting moves very well even in thick grass"
5.0,A great contraption for watering the lawn.....hook it up and away she drives watering the lawn.....we love it...
4.0,"Good mechanical product, works awesome!

Large piece of paint chipped off during first couple weeks of use."
5.0,perfect
5.0,Love it
5.0,Great concept.  Now I am not stuck at home waiting to move sprinklers from one area to another.
5.0,"I haven't had a chance to use this sprinkler, but I like the way it is to be used."
5.0,"I used to have an Ortho Sprayette and loved it, yet that sprayer went out of production. After a year of climbing a ladder to spray my trees, I found this Gilmour Sprayer and absolutely love its spray, ease of use, and that it easily sprays to the height of my adult trees."
5.0,"She did the job. She did the job well. She continues to work. Never a problem, even trusted her to knock down yellow jackets nests, now thats trust. If you have had a problem with yours you must have had a dud, or I must have received a stud :P"
5.0,I bought this to assist me with my inset genocide. This was the best thing I could have ever bought. But I did get soaked because I forgot to use the rubber grommet washer. Once I put it on I was good to go. This is perfect!
4.0,"I used it for insecticide. It dilutes the chemical more than the set amount and also not as strong as I wanted, but it is helpful to cover  large area."
4.0,"My ortho broke (plastic) - bought this for a little more. So far, holding up well. Adjustable spray head allows one to direct flow to where you want it to be. I think it's better built vs. the ortho and will hopefully last a while."
5.0,"I have used the commercial hose sprayed weed killers purchased at the big box stores that have the hose connected bottle included but always wondered why the bottle never seemed to empty.  Well that was because it wasn't working.  The Gilmour 362 sprayer is a quality unit mostly brass and metal.  The sprayer container bottle seems small but perhaps that is for weight.  The only part to be careful with is the plastic deflector at the front that deflects the spray down.  It can be easily broken if not careful.  Instructions are okay but not overly detailed and you ultimately have to rely on guidelines on the weed killer used.  Not really sure what I was doing but tried a setting of ""2"" for a Trimec weed killer and it seemed to work fine.  Followed the cleanup procedure and the Gilmour was good to go for five more applications.  Would definitely purchase this again."
3.0,A lot of parts that matter on this are made of cheap plastic. Look forward to buying another in the future.
5.0,"Although I need a product like this, I've never had on last longer than a year. I'll give you an update a
a year from now. Also, the sprayer only has two directions ""Up or Down"". I would be nice to have some variety."
4.0,"Makes the job of spraying nutrients, or whatever you need, a lot faster to your plants than the hand-held bottle I used to use."
4.0,"This hose-end sprayer works extremely well and is simple to use but with one caveat.  Even carefully following the included instructions, thick concentrate is a problem."
5.0,Love them and they usually last me a few years.
5.0,"I specifically bought these shears to prune my indoor plants (for cutting stems and light branches). These shears are light weight, the safety feature is easy to use.

I'm not sure I would use these to prune my outdoor shrubs, but for what I need them and the price I have no complaints."
5.0,Great quality and trusted name.
5.0,Perfect.  I do tons of pruning an these never fail.  Never
5.0,"These pruning shears are a great value. They are sturdy, reliable, and sharp. I have used these a few times this season already and I feel confident that they will be put to good use for the rest of this year."
5.0,"Finally some pruning shears that I won't lose the spring from.  Sharp, easy to use, comfortable grip.  Decided to buy a second pair because we were fighting over who got to use them as we have a lot of pruning to do in our fruit orchards."
5.0,Sturdy and great manufactured!
5.0,Perfect
5.0,worked nicely clipping my shrubs that extend over to my driveway and need some upkeep. would need larger ones for larger shrubs or shaping but for the clipping I was doing they worked great. did not hurt my hands and were easy to use
5.0,just what i needed for my garden pruning
1.0,The picture of this pump and the actual pump are not the same. The cord is 1/2 the length stated in the description and the dimensions are not the same. After my first review I was contacted by the distributor and offered five dollors to change my review. The lady told me amazon.com chose the photo to display and it was not her fault the pump and dimensions were not the same as described. Classic bait and switch.
5.0,"Had purchased this same pump at a local home improvement store at twice the price and was going to use it for a Pondless Pond project to feed water to a Calling Crane Pond Spitter and a Turtle Bubbler, but the pump on my Bamboo Fountain quit working, so I used this on it instead and found this great deal at Amazon.com, so I bought 3 at the same time; 1 for the Pondless Pond project and 2 as spares since I have several water features and each one can use this pump because the water flow (lift) is easily adjustable."
5.0,"Not a lot of ways one can review this product. It either works or it does not. For me, it's working as expected, the Amazon seller was quick to ship"
4.0,"bought this pump to replace weak factory pump that came with fountain purchase.
 this pump works great, much quieter and has a strong steady stream. no problems
with it so far."
4.0,"Beckett seems to build a much better fountain pump than the others that I've tried.  We have an outdoor fountain that can be hard on pumps (the wide temperature changes in Texas and the debris accumulation).  The previous Beckett pump lasted far longer (I'd guess at least 5 years) than any of the other brands that we've tried.

I ordered another brand, and it wouldn't work after I installed it, so I had to return it.  Thankfully, Amazon has a ""no hassle"" return process, but I wish I hadn't disassembled the fountain, run the wiring, reassembled, leveled, and refilled with water -- only to discover it wouldn't work.  Then I had to disassemble again.  Cement fountain pieces are heavy and bulky, in case you wondered.  I bought another similar pump (different brand) from Home Depot and tested it in a bucket of water first, and had to return that one since it would only hum and not pump.

Finally, I've got a pump that works and have learned to stick with Beckett.  I've also learned to pre-test the pumps before installing.  The only problem I've found with this pump is that Amazon advertises a 15 foot power cord (the same length as my previous Beckett cord), but only a 6 foot cord was provided.  I'll have to attach and weatherproof an extension to reach the power outlet.  If this pump lasts as long as the previous Beckett, we'll be very satisfied."
5.0,"Perfect for my usage! I just wanted to spray some natural fish byproduct fertilizer on my yard. This worked great.

If you found this review helpful, please click Helpful below :)"
3.0,"cheap....that's about it.  you get what you pay for here.  it does the job, but not too sure about the actual mixing ratio it is supposed to maintain.  seems like a lot more than the advertised volume came out, especially at the beginning....then it came out a lot faster at the end. so it may be too dilute at first and then more concentrated at the end.  ?????"
3.0,"Not crazy about the weak flow I get from this. l have an OLD Ortho that worked like a charm, but the plastic wore out. (It was 20 years old!!!)"
5.0,"I own three of these for various yard chemical applications. Very good quality, doesn't tear up even when using harsh chemicals. I tried another brand of sprayer last year and returned it after one use because the quality was nowhere near as good as this one."
4.0,"it works fine, does what it's supposed to do!"
5.0,"I use sprayers all the time...I particularly like ones like this Gilmour, it is simple, though it doesn't have adjustable concentration, I like this one that gives higher concentration, for most of the chemicals I need to dilute, it works out well.  It is well balanced and easy to handle (Important when you are dealing with a liquid, and have hoses and other stuff in your hand.  I only wish it would spray further to reach the crown of my tree, but otherwise is very useful, I use it multiple times per week around my yard."
3.0,"At least it doesn't leak all over me.  This is probably the best of this type sprayer you can expect to find.  Having said that,  it doesn't spray very high...like for fruit trees etc.  Its OK  for garden plants, bushes, and the like.  I guess there is not a good one of these that really does the job available.  It is beyond manufacturers to make one that really works at any price.  I shall try using my pressure washer (1200psi) with the soap dispenser filled with whatever I'm spraying.  That should do the trick :)"
5.0,"works exactly like designed automatically mixes the chemical.simple yet very effective hopefully will last the entire ""bug season""good product very happy w/ purchase"
4.0,"I often spray ornamental trees with a mixture of chemicals, so the new single-chemical, ""dial a concentration"" sprayers don't suit.  Deflector is removable to permit spraying to the tops of trees (20"").  Only bad design feature is the lack of control of the type of spray as was a feature on older hose sprayers that are no longer available in our area."
3.0,"Starts out good pressure for cleaning the area around the pool, but after a year both of them lost pressure, and I need to replace them."
5.0,My husband uses this in our boot wash in our hog barn office.  He says this has lasted the longest out of the many brands we have purchased over the years.  I have 6 more on order.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"Do you remember how, back in the old days, things were made out of metal and would last for years and years? Well, this item harks back to those days. Perhaps, someday you might need to pop out the rubber washer and replace it, but otherwise, you're set.

I don't usually write reviews. However, just now I went to order another nozzle (my fourth -- we've got lots of hose hookups here) and it occurred to me that given my devotion to this particular item, I ought to note how good I think it is. Light spray, full spray, it does everything a ""spritzer"" is supposed to do. And it lasts. 'Nuff said."
5.0,I am very happy that I bought this nozzle. It is exactly what I wanted. Good quality and I highly recommend it. I really need it too.
5.0,"This is a great nozzle. I have used a lot of these over the years, but I can no longer find them in hardware stores, so I went to Amazon. It came from a company named Deerso. When UPS lost my package, Deerso was extremely responsive, even though it was not their mistake."
5.0,My wife wanted to replace our hose end sprayer.  There were a lot of choices.  I chose this one because if was metal.  It works great and she is happy.
4.0,Bought it for my husband who had never seen this type of sprinkler (my family had one when I was young).  Tried it out when we received it and he loved it.  Unfortunately severe water restrictions started the next day so haven't been able to use it since.  Looking forward to when restrictions lifted.
5.0,love it
5.0,I don't have automatic sprinklers in my backyard. This does the trick. It evenly distributed water throughout my yard
5.0,Wow ! Should have bought this sooner  - well before spending $$$ on those cheaper impact sprinklers - does the job extremely well and irrigates my 7000 sq feet back yard without a problem in about 6 hours
1.0,Giant pile broke five weeks after purchasing on relatively flat grass. now it travels 1/4 original speed on Hi. Gears are cheap and plastic and break easily
5.0,"The Nelson 1865 RainTrain Traveling Sprinkler is the best sprinkler ever in the history of sprinklers or grass. As a small urban homesteader, hydration is critical to my crops. And let me tell you, bra, my little rental house can crank out a gnarly amount of fruits and vegetables and, you know, other herbs and stuff, when the soil is properly watered.

I sometimes have problems with my short-term memory, which is one reason why the Nelson 1865 RainTrain Traveling Sprinkler is perfect for me. I can set it in one part of my grow area, and then it moves several feet on its own as it waters! That way I don't forget to move it around and dry out my herbs. Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuude! Is that freakin sick or what? Plus it's a totes adorbs little tractor.

I told all my buds in Austin, Denver and British Columbia about this amazing little sprinkler. It moves pretty fast (with an adjustable speed setting) and moving things fast is something I know all my friends appreciate. My good bra Diego from South Texas buys them three at a time! Of course, the last few he shot with a gold-plated Serbian AK-47 he calls Poco Paco. It seems like a waste of a fine sprinkler to me but its his money and he always seems to have plenty of cash.

And the Nelson 1865 RainTrain Traveling Sprinkler moves on its own while watering!

Wait, I already said that.

Anyhoo, the unit is easy to operate: just play Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon and put the sprinkler on its lowest setting. By the time you finish an 11oz bag of Doritos Nacho Cheese Flavored Tortilla Chips and the RainTrain finishes its full run youll not only have a lush, verdant lawn space but be able to pay Big Winkie back the money you owe him, plus vig and expenses.

Bra, you should totally score a Nelson 1865 RainTrain Traveling Sprinkler today. And remember to pay cash so The Man doesnt know what you're buying--or growing. Peace and love."
5.0,Great
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this sprinkler tractor!~  So easy to set up (just watch a youtube about it - takes minutes) and leave it alone.  Guess my only trouble is remembering to shut it off when it's done.  May need timers for that.  We live in the country and have about 3 acres of grassy area.  Really helps us keep it green in the hot summers.
This does not ""drive"" over pavement (or didn't for us, anyway)
It covers a really wide span of grass"
5.0,Love it.  Better than expected
1.0,Don't waste your money on this plastic piece of junk.  I've owned Nelson tractor sprinklers before and they were all heavy duty and I used them literally until they wore out.  I bought this one a year ago and the plastic gears and transmission are already broken....and it has had only minimal use. The water shut-off button is too low (or the rear wheels are) because it frequently shuts off from just touching the garden hose.
4.0,"Bottle little bit small, but the spray look fine because sometime it was stuck, I must clean a little bit at the tip."
4.0,"I use this to spray the FoxFarm brand organic liquid fertilizer (Big Bloom, Big Grow, etc.) around my plants every 2 weeks....it diminishes the power of the hose substantially, but it does work and the plants love the result....."
4.0,worked pretty well not hard to use  does have a tendency to turn over when you set it down. clean as told to in other reviews.
5.0,"I've been looking for this sprayer for years.  All you have to do is connect the sprayer to the hose, fill the bottle with the undiluted concentrate, set the dial on the top to the mixture desired and begin spraying.  I don't have the best water pressure but even with the mediocre water pressure I could reach the top of a three story building by standing on a step ladder.  I've only used this sprayer once but I completed the job in half the time it usually takes me.  My only complaint is that I haven't had this sprayer before.  Thw hose nozzle is solid metal and the mixing valve is made of heavy duty, rust proof brass.  Great product!"
5.0,"I have been using for insect/mosquito control in my customers yards as well as mine. Provides great coverage and easy to use. Seems to be made with quality parts. Based on other reviews, I have been sure to clean well with each use and have had no problems. If you have a large area to cover or plan on doing it in a commercial application, this is a great choice.

Update-03-28-15
Just bought another. Not because the first one failed, but because I wanted a second before the price went up anymore:) I have actually found this to be very effective with all herbacides. Solid , quality product!"
1.0,"when you open up the item, you are lucky if you read the sign before using it.. or you may never even notice - it says - Warning! the product contains lead, which can cause you cancer, wash your hands and never touch it with your mouth. Not on the box, but right on the bottle. Tanks very much for disclosing this information in the product description. Why and, again, why would you make it out of lead???????? seriously. I'm so sad i didn't not read negative reviews for this product, such a pain i have to deal with it now. No lead will be allowed in my house."
5.0,"I've used this only once so far this season, but found that it is well made, and easy to use.  I used it to spray trees, at least as high as I could spray (about 25-30 feet) it, and then ornamentals. Works very well. I've followed the manual by thoroughly rinsing that cleaning with soapy water before stowing away. This should ensure long service life.

It will slop out the top if it tips over, so figure out a way to hang it over a fence or a bucket while the hose is attached to minimize the risk of spillage."
4.0,Ordered this for some thin and thick product.. has worked with both and so happy with item..  4 out of 5 - because wish container was bigger
2.0,it works really well  as  a  pressure washer for  my  awning over  my  windows and for  cleaning  side walks. have recommended  it  to several  of my  friends.  joe
5.0,"I needed a sprayer that would be able to shoot insecticide on to my two story house siding to prevent spiders.  I also needed it to be able to spray high into a tree.  This simple device does that well and more.  When you remove the deflector, it shoots a powerful stream a great distance.  With the deflector it produces a great spray pattern.  I have 3 other sprayers made by ortho, and by far this one is my favorite.  It looks simple, but it is very well designed and does exactly what I needed it to do."
5.0,The best pruning shears.
5.0,ok
1.0,"I would like to return these shears but it seems it is not giving me that option. I ordered a pair for my parent's as well but I haven't given that to them because the one I kept for me ""sticks"" together each time I cut something. I don't know how else to explain, but I am not happy and would like to return for another. Again, I don't know if the other will be the same as I haven't opened it because it was for my parents."
5.0,EXACTLY as described! EXCELLENT quality! VERY pleased!
1.0,"I ordered these friskars for my mother for Christmas. She just opened them yesterday and tried to trim mum stems and the friskars broke instantly. Now, they are as good as garbage because they do not work, the balde does not close all the way- it is out of alignment. A complete waste of money and completely embarrassing that I gave someone a defective gift. I would NOT recommend this product or any other products made by this manufacturer."
5.0,thay work just fine says my wife.
5.0,Great. Easy to use.
4.0,"So far these have been good.  I only used them a few times on my palm tress and this product cuts with ease. My tress are juvenile not to thick, I like them.  The only issue is the handle grip was to slide off right out the packaging. Still a good product."
5.0,I have some stubborn soft green hedges that have outlived two sets of pruning shears. These are proving to be the sturdiest and most gunk resistant of the types I've tried. A previous brand would constantly get mashed bark and leaves stuck in the base of the shears making it impossible to fully open or close them. These are stronger built and snip through anything without allowing the fibers to become lodged.
5.0,Heavy duty and work great
4.0,Works exactly like it's supposed to.  Shipping was fast and I am very happy that it fit where it was supposed to and works accordingly
2.0,"Purchased the 200 GPH model as a replacement pump for my fountain after reading the various reviews. Before choosing this model I had read the manufacturers specifications and originally ordered this 130 GPH model which seemed would be up to the job.  I was informed by the supplier after a few days that they did not infact have that pump in stock so I ordered the larger model instead assuming it would work even better.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  This pump  bareley provides enough flow over a 3 1/2 foot high urn style fountain even though the specs say good for up to 4 feet - even at maximum flow setting and clean piping.
Would definitely suggest going to a much larger model - even twice the flow rate, and dial back if necessary to suit the need."
1.0,"I ordered the Beckett 130gph auto off fountain pump. It arrived on time and as described.  I placed it in the fountain, plugged it in, and....... nothing.  I gave it a little shake, heard a faint grinding noise and that was it.  I boxed it up and exchanged it for a second one of the same make.  Amazon's return policy made it easy to exchange! I got the second pump in a matter of days.  I again placed the pump in the fountain and this time was excited to see that it pumped.  But, alas, my excitement was quickly dashed away when the pump stopped after a mere 3 seconds.  But then, all of a sudden it started pumping after nothing for about 2 seconds.  It repeated this pattern, 3 seconds on, 2 off, for bit before stopping completely.  I am returning the second pump tomorrow and am currently looking for another brand of pump.  My advice, stay away from Beckett's pumps."
5.0,"not sure how to review a water pump. I plugged it in, the thing works, my fountain spouts water!

the only thing that I can review it on, is possibly durability. I bought a beckett pump about 6 years ago, and it finally burned out! So in terms of durability, I would say 6 years of continual use would qualify.

For the price, it's worth the investment!"
1.0,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering.  Since I was replacing an old M130 that overheated due to low water, I thought I knew what I was getting.

I did read the specifications which said I would get a 15 FOOT CORD but instead I only got a 6 FOOT CORD.

I don't know how I will make this work.

I will admit after all the things I have ordered from Amazon, this is the first time they disappointed me."
1.0,"The pump that arrived was not as pictured, but that didn't matter to me as long as the GPH was correct. I used it in a very small fountain  and it didn't pump water any faster than my old pump that was only 75 gph. After working for less than a day, it finally...ran...down...to.....a trickle. So I returned it."
5.0,"I had this model pump for approx 20 years with good service.
The only problem was annual sticking of the impeller.
Solved by lubricating shaft.
Went on vacation this summer and the care taker allowed the fountain to  go dry and the pump burned up.
Replaced with a smaller(80 gph)because the Beckett pump was not available locally and I didn't want to delay getting my fountain operating for the birds and animals in this Texas drought. Replacement pump was totally inadequate and filter clogged up every day. Order the Beckett 90 gph pump and it is as satisfactory as the original pump.
Quick and courteous service from Amazon...gwd"

To my dismay, when I received the pump, it only had a 6 foot cord. Reading other/previous reviews, I noted that another customer had made the same complaint previously. Guess I learned two things---read reviews in advance and do not necessarily believe the detailed description placed in the ad. for this to have happened to one customer is understandable--mistakes happen. However--when it happens to more than one customer over a period of time, it tells me that Pricebully does NOT consider customer feedback and attempt to avoid the same mistake down the road.  Leif Grytebust"
3.0,"Using to replace a statuary pump made in Germany which is no longer available but did a great job for the 5 years it was in use. The Beckett (M130AUL) I received looks different from the picture and is more squarish and flatter that the Beckett I ordered. It works OK but the flow rate, raising the water to a spigot 36"" above the bottom of the pump, Is barely acceptable and forces me to keep the height of the water in the bowl several inches higher than I did with the old pump. However, I will say that the pump is quieter than the pump it replaced."
5.0,"The pump arrived on time since seller delivered promptly.
I'm using it on a pondless fountain I built on my front yard and it has worked perfectly since (1 month ago).
It's a great buy for the price and I would absolutely recommend both the seller and the product.
When I purchased it, the product description said 15' power cord which is not right (it's 6'). I contacted the seller so they address this issue.
Other than that, the product is excellent."
5.0,"Once the hose is where you want, you can walk away and not have to worry about moving the sprinkler over and over."
1.0,"This seemed like it would be a good idea.  This sprinkler is built like a tank-or at least the outside casting is.  The nylon gears were stripped the third time I used it!  Now the question is, where can I buy either a new transmission or if I'm lucky, individual gears?  Very disappointed with this purchase."
5.0,Good product and shipping.
1.0,"Gear Drive striped out, Nelson would not replace gear set. They want $30.00 for a plastic gear,"
4.0,Works pretty good does jump off hose some times but does follow hose for the most part a decent product 
5.0,Great
4.0,Works well. I have to remember to take it out of neutral for it to travel. Need to be aware when it gets to the brake as the water is still running.
5.0,"Wonderful product, this is my second one  in several years. I would still have the first one if I hadn't run over it with my van. :)"
5.0,Love it!
5.0,Lawn sprinklers are amazing! We love them and couldn't be happier with our purchase.
5.0,"Would recommend to all gardeners.  Easy to use for a multitude of jobs such as spraying the lawn, garden or shrubbery with fertilizer or insecticide.  Quality construction for years of use.  I just bought one to replace a previous Gilmour sprayer that I had used for over 20 years.  By removing the black tip on the sprayer a jet stream that reaches at least 30 feet can be used to spray for insects in high places that a normal sprayer could not reach. Very fair price for a high quality product."
5.0,"I hate dandelions.  My 7 y.o. daughter think's they're pretty.  I don't care.  I want them dead.  The Gilmour 362 Professional No Pre-Mix Sprayer in conjunction with the Weed-b-Gon concentrate helped me murder those dandelions.  The construction is sturdy, and as far as I can tell, the 'dial-a-mix' on the sprayer works accurately.  One thing that would have been helpful is if they could have a tablespoon/fluid ounces per gallon conversion on the sprayer itself, but a quick google lookup helped me convert ounces to tablespoons per gallon.  I used to have similar devices, but they all had cheap plastic spray handles...this one should last a lifetime (or until they devise a way to permanently rid the world of those yellow flowering bastards that turn into fun puffy seedlings)"
5.0,This tool allows you to spray pesticide on your plants without mixing in a sprayer can.  It mixes automatically.  Easy cleanup also.  We'll built for long use.
5.0,"Good quality and easy to use. Highly recommend. With hose, very high efficiency for sprayer large area. Very good item and design"
5.0,"Surprisingly this thing is actually very easy to use, works really well and doesn't leak.  Would buy again.  Easy to set for Tsp or Tblsp mixing and seems fairly accurate."
4.0,"Better quality than most and sprays further, The price was good and had a valve to turn supply on or off..  JT"
5.0,"Purchased this to apply treatments to my lawn. works very well. No leaks. Seems well-built. I noticed on the box that Gilmour is a Robert Bosch company, which is good news I have a high reguard for many of their power tools.

There was a review that I read where someone may not use her pressure washer after using this thing, but I can NOT relate to that comment, as this sprayer does not provide a ""blasting"" stream of fluid(good news for my grass)."
5.0,"These are the easiest to use, easiest to clean up and wonderful for us senior citizens to understand how to use!"
4.0,"IMPORTANT- The nozzle has a ""clip,"" but you need a needle plier to secure it to , otherwise it doesnt work."
4.0,"After several disappointing purchases of Plastic hose end sprayers that turned out to be nothing more then cheap Chinese made plastic junk I;m happy to report that this sprayer does the job,  plus it also has some metal parts, The only thing I wish it had was  a bigger container, But luckily you can just screw the top part rite to your bottle of insecticide or weed killer (If Its The Same Size) and  spray away."
5.0,"This small simple device has saved me so much labor spraying my landscaping.
Just get one, you won't be sorry.

Easy to operate.
Easy to clean."
4.0,"This is a simple device that works well.  I buy insecticide in bottles that are designed with an integrated sprayer, to be attached directly to a hose.  I found that the Venturi tube (the tube that sucks the spray from te bottle) did not have enough lift to drain more than two thirds of the insecticide from bottle.  I now open the bottles--they are not designed to be opened and have to be forced a bit--and pour the insecticide into the Gilmour sprayer.  It makes a big difference, not only because the Gilmour sprayer uses every last drop, but because the Gilmour sprayer is manufactured to tighter qulaity standards than the disposabale plastic inesticide bottle, so the Gilmour sprayer makes a tightwater seal to the hose."
2.0,The lower settings did not seem to use any of the concentrate after half an hour of use so I had to crank the setting up to five instead of two.
3.0,"This is my error - but I couldn't imagine any sprayer would possibly be on the market that was this small!  I can't even use the mix I was planning for my mulch pile - one can of soda, one can of beer and one cup of ammonia - as it is WAY WAY WAY too small for that!  WHAT was I thinking not to check size.  LOOK at the thing!  It's TINY!!!!  What was I thinking????  (NOT thinking!)
Haven't used it yet - harumph."
5.0,"I have been through a few sprayers recently trying to get something that will both spray weed killer on my lawn and horticultural oil up into my 30+ foot Hemlocks that are infested with woolly adelgid. The plastic junk out there doesn't work. This sprayer has an old fashioned metal handle attached to a brass head that dials in the ounces per gallon. A brass spray nipple covered with a plastic diffuser delivers the mixture into a solid stream or spray. Pull the diffuser off and the stream just about hits the top of my trees. Replace the diffuser and a solid but fine spray angles down quickly soaking everything in it's arc. The device also has a clever screw out nipple that can be used for spraying teaspoons per gallon.

The old-fashioned look and construction delivers old-fashioned results!"
5.0,"I've been using a backpack sprayer for applying wet&forget, canvas waterproofing, plant liquid food, etc. It has been great if one doesn't mind carrying a 4 gallon backpack, constant pumping to maintain pressure and topping up contents for the 4 gallon tank fairly often. I needed something that doesn't require topping up content ever so often and unused content can be returned to original container! Hence, decided on this self-mixing hose-end sprayer. Both hose-end sprayer and backpack sprayer have its pros and cons. It all depends on your needs.

I tested the mixing ratio and it appears to siphon the content correctly depending on the chosen mixing ratio. No leak and the spray was consistent throughout a 1000 sq ft lawn coverage.

Features of this Gilmour 362 Professional No Pre-Mix Sprayer:
- Heavy duty Zinc handle (has a Hold Open Clip so you need not depress the sprayer handle all the time)
- Brass mixing head
- 16 ounces capacity (for your mix)
- 16 Mixing ratios/dilution rates (8 for teaspoon, 8 for tablespoon)
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 10 tablespoon per gallon
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 10 teaspoon per gallon (with teaspoon converter)

Caution:
- This product contains Lead but it serves its purpose well.
- The mesh strainer at the bottom end of the siphon tube is very fine and appears to be best suited for liquid only content. I would advice against any content that is too thick (fairly high viscosity) or has residue (powdery mix) to avoid clogging.
- The siphon tube does not reach all the way to the bottom of the tank. So if you have little content left or are tilting the bottle, it may not siphon anything and just sprays water!
- Always flush out sprayer (with clean water) to avoid cross contamination with other contents as well as ensuring no clogging for later use. I do this for all my sprayers and they still works great after many years.
- Requires hose water pressure of 40-60 psi. Otherwise, it may not siphon the content/mix correctly.
- The mixing ratio design is such that underneath the dial/mixing head, there are multiple holes with different depths. These holes are actually pressing on a ball-bearing that controls how much content will be siphoned. Therefore, when turning the dial/mixing head, you should feel a subtle click and you'll know that the ball bearing is correctly positioned. If not positioned correctly, it will not siphon anything!
- If it does leak, there may be a missing o-ring washer.
- If you have water getting into the bottle (and diluting your content), you may have a defective unit because this comes with a built-in anti-siphon mechanism that prevents backflow.
- The bottle opening is about 1-inch wide. I use a funnel to pour content in and avoid spilling.

Quality Control Problems:
I had to order a replacement to eventually get this sprayer to work. I called Gilmour and they said I should just get a replacement since it is within the return period. When it works, it's great!
First order - Missing Head Coupling Washer (without this, the mixing head does not depress the ball-bearing that is used to adjust the mixing ratio)
Second replacement order - Missing Teaspoon converter (without this, cannot convert to teaspoon mixing ratio)"
5.0,"Seller good, product works as expected, though for some reason I expected it to be bigger. About the diameter of the average cup"
4.0,"I used this sprayer to spread moss killer on my yard. It's is really nice quality and it feels like it will last a long time. I like the spray pattern and it was ergonomic to use.

One immediate drawback that became apparent when I went to fill it was the neck of the bottle is really small, about the size of a standard 2L soda bottle. This makes filling difficult and may require the use of a funnel, especially with something as staining as an iron-based moss killer. That is why I am knocking off 1 star, otherwise it is perfect."
5.0,"Just as expected, it works well and didn't find any downsides after using it one season.  Easy to read and set dial for concentration."
1.0,"Please note that this product contains lead, which is not disclosed as part of product description.  This information alone would have changed my mind."
4.0,My second one....first lasted 15 years.
5.0,Does a great lob of uniformly watering.
5.0,This has been a great purchase and I use it daily.
4.0,Very pleased with the traveling sprinkler. I am impressed with how will it is made. it jumps the hose at times but I believe it is caused by the hose kinking. Works as advertized.
5.0,I bought this to add to a unit I bought from home depot.  If you are on the fence don't hesitate.  This thing out performs the home depot brand big time.  It actually pulls the length of hose it advertises.  The speed settings are nice.  Haven't had an issue with it at all.
5.0,Works as advertised.  Buy two and race them!
5.0,Very cool invention.  I have been using it for about a week now and have been pleased how I can cover 3500 square feet of grass by only moving it once.  There are a few tricks to it but it is way more efficient than moving sprinklers throughout the day.  Seems very durable  and should last a long time.
4.0,It works well except when it hits a dirt spot while trying to drag more than about 25 feet of hose it gets stuck.
5.0,Outstanding!  Works great!  Solved my irrigation issue.
5.0,"This is by far NOT a poor mans answer to a 'built in irrigation or sprinkler system' . This is a smart persons choice for a great way to water your lawn. I live in a climate ( Cleveland Ohio ) that often sees torrid winters and cold temperatures thus a in ground system is just a hassle with mega maintenance . One of the great things it will mystify you neighbors, especially the young ones. Fun to watch 'Nelson' on the front portico with a cocktail and your buddies. BUY IT!!!!"
2.0,The opening is too small.
5.0,Good quality at fair price.
5.0,Great  snips
4.0,Great pruning shears. They seam sharper than my old stand by corona shears. Time will tell if that lasts. I will keep you posted.....
5.0,Perfect
5.0,very sharp and I really like the lock
1.0,The blade is not very strong and it started to catch on its under belly while trying to close it. When not even cutting anything it snagged while squeezing it. I had to shave off the loose metal so that i could close it. Cutting a 3/5 inch branch it started to bow out . The product is still fairly new and should not be having issues already. (only cut a few smaller things.)
5.0,"Perfect, wish that I would have purchased a couple more at the time."
4.0,These are perfect for trimming our yard.
2.0,"ok, nothing of being of very high quality"
5.0,nice alternative to what the box stores are selling within same price point.  good pressure to reach the tops of trees. recommend using a garden hose ball valve between this and hose
4.0,One thing that wasn't immediately clear to me... is that the front tip is a sort of defuser.  You can twist it up to shoot the water away from you or down or sideways.  It's easy to direct where you are spraying.  It makes spraying insecticidal soap on orange trees super easy.
4.0,"The sprayer worked very well, seemed to distribute the product in the bottle very well. Wish the spray could be adjusted to more of a center pattern."
5.0,I buy pesticides and herbicides in concentration.  ive been using the pump action for a while and it was annoying.  This thing works perfectly!
5.0,"This hose end sprayer is perfect for applying Rubenito Organic Fish,Seaweed, & Worm Foliar Spray to large areas such as lawns or large yards with lots of plants. it has a teaspoon and a tablespoon per gallon settings . I use the tablespoon setting at number 7 to spray my entire yard. clean up is a snap. great product"
4.0,Does what it is supposed to do. Much better than those cheap plastic sprayers. Had to play with settings though as it used a lot more mix than what I set it at. Should last a long time. Easy to clean.
5.0,I was skeptical but works perfect.  I used it to give my trees a soap and water shower.  Very sturdy; looks like it will be a member of the garden family tools box for years.
3.0,Haven't tried it yet but just from looking at it the chemical supply bottle is way too small. I hope to find a larger bottle and straw that will work. Hopefully it will spray upto 30ft as advertised.
1.0,"DOes not evenly distribute nematodes. I bought it so mix things but everything I have tried to distribute on my lawn so far, anti-grub spores and nematodes, and other things all didn't work. It almost feels like it got more of all the stuff I am spraying on my hands and on me than on my lawn. I followed the directions carefully and tried it out many times, perhaps I""m not that good at this but it didn't work out for me."
4.0,"I have only used this one time, but it is clearly better quality than the Ortho sprayers which I have used.  Tips from prior users were helpful regarding cleaning the unit thoroughly after use, being aware of its unstable base if you put it down, and adjusting the spray control.  I had no problem with the dosage dial, but there are small parts which require watching when you assemble and disassemble for use or cleaning.  Seems like good quality for the price."
4.0,works fine so far
1.0,"Worked great... for 2 months,  then the transmission began slipping. The transmission case doesn't open,  so you have to buy a whole new transmission $30. I could open the transmission case enough to see the gears are made of plastic and that plenty of dirt had been able to work it's way in there,  likely aiding the gear teeth in wearing. China...."
5.0,we love ours and so does our neighbor so we got them one for his birthday
5.0,works great!
5.0,My mother used one of these to water or yard when I was a child. Now that I water my own yard I realize that this truly is the best way to water. I can loop it to go around the pool and water areas that are hard to hit with standard sprinklers. You can start it and leave it (just check occasionally that it is still moving).  The water stays low so it isn't watering the leaves of the trees as it goes by.  It gives a good slow soaking.  Some of my favorite childhood memories was running through a sprinkler like this. It's just a great sprinkler!
5.0,It was great. Exactly as described.
5.0,"On Time, Great Product"
5.0,It works great. Easy to use.
5.0,Coolest sprinkler ever.  Just bought another one to give my sister for her birthday.  Because she was going to order one for herself anyway.
5.0,Works well. Slower than I thought but that's probably my water pressure. I would definitely recommend to someone who isn't able to move sprinklers or be home when it needs to be turned off.
5.0,Best value in the market.  Fiskars makes consistently great products.
1.0,garbage. It doesn't fully close so you can't cut anything
4.0,These clippers work well
5.0,Great quality!
5.0,Very good shears! Sorry I haven't written the review sooner. It is comfortable to use and does a good job.
5.0,Nice pruning shears.  Soft handles.
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"These are comfortable to use and are incredibly effective. It made quick, effortless work of pruning 5 fruit trees. It was able to clip through branches as thick as my finger with some minimal effort. YMMV.

I also forgot them outside, covered in sap, in the rain, for three days and they didn't immediately begin to corrode. So there is that. :)

Fiskars did a great job on these."
5.0,nice shears cant beat Fiskars!
5.0,"Well made, looks like it will last a very long time. Fiskars is the best in the business"
5.0,this little works just as it suppose to and it not very neat and spray were it is suppose too
2.0,This will only meter 1 tsp. or 1 tablespoon to a gallon... the concentrate to be used is 2 tablespoons to 100 gallons. I do not know how to calculate the dilution I need to put in the container to meter out at 1 tsp. to a gallon. 1-800 number was no help...
2.0,"I really expected more out of this based on the advertising.  I tried to spray castor oil through this (mole control) and it would not even move a drop of it at the highest dilution rate.  I then tried other lower viscosity liquids, down to even water, and it still did not create sufficient suction to evenly dilute and spray.  Back to the tried and true Hudson sprayer...much more work but reliable!"
4.0,"They don't last forever, but perform very well to the end of life.  Amazon offers these at a very fair price, and they are excellent for liquid food and pesticide delivery."
5.0,IT DOES THE JOB WORKS VERY GOOD  ONLY THING IS THAT AFTER ABOUT A YEAR IT QUITS WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD. THE DRAW OR SUCKSUION QUITS. GOOD THING IT HAS A LIFE TIME WARRANTY . BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS GREAT.
2.0,"The unit leaked from the first time it was used .. does the job, but trickles all over the person spraying."
4.0,"A mixture of brass and plastic parts connected to a cheap spray nozzle.  It works easy enough, but I wouldn't recommend dropping it."
5.0,"Its is a very good product. Make sure you always rinse it out.

All parts of this sprayer is made with good materials. No thin plastic or loose seals.

Make sure you re tighten the bottle back onto the sprayer....Well it is hard to explain with words but the gray sprayer where it connects to the brass part. There is a fitting that just screws into the sprayer. If it comes loose the sprayer will spray even when the trigger is not squeezed. There is no defect or anything wrong here its just the way it is."
5.0,"I have struggled to find a hose end sprayer to treat my shrubbery and lawn. This sprayer, although tiny, has a great spray pattern and is adjustable. It is also made out of metal so it is nice and sturdy. The bottle size is great for small trees and bushes but you may end up refilling for big jobs. At least it works!"
5.0,Works great....  build good for Chinese mfg'g...  used it several times without any problems.. Would buy again or recommend ......
5.0,"Works extremely well just don't pull too much hose in loose soil, it will get stuck but will shut off when it diggs down so deep and shut off valve hits the hose, shut off ramp works very well.  I bought two of these and glad I did use them just about every day."
2.0,This sprinkler works great for about a year. The internal gears are low quality. I used this sprinkler on level ground on each use. The gears that are propelled by the water to move the sprinkler across the lawn begin to make a clicking sound indicating that they are moving but they areally enept to drive the rear tractor wheels. These tractors are too expensive to have to replace every one to two years. Furthermore we live in a climate that only requires watering 4 months out of the year and this sprinkler is a supplement to our irrigation syatem. So it does not get used that much.
5.0,"Great little device for the right lawn.  Works the best on long rectangular or fixed width swaths.  You can just about set it and forget it.  Although there is some reservation on the forget it part.  Don't let a day go by before checking if it completed.

If you have an odd shaped lawn with narrow and wide paths then it gets a bit challenging.  Either increase the spread and overshoot the narrow areas or reduce spread and miss the edges on the wide areas.  If you curve the track (hose), don't bend less then the instructed 8' radius, because it will jump the track and bee line until it hits something to stop it.  And, the water will continue to flow.  That is a real experience for me.

The next best thing to water your lawn would be an underground sprinkler system.  It does a good job on what it was intended to do.  Be careful in handling, particularly the fragile nylon gearing and sprinkler arms.  The body is solid metal and will likely last forever."
5.0,I'm able to water my entire lawn with only two trips outside.  The auto shutoff is very nice.  I'm so glad I found this before spending thousands on a sprinkler system!
4.0,"This is my second raintrain.  They are durable and do a fantastic job.  I have a large property and run these on more than 75 feet of hose.  They will have some trouble dragging the hose uphill, but otherwise only really soft turf will be a problem (they will dig a rut if they get stuck).  In more than 10 years, the only thing that ever broke was the stop device that mounts to the garden hose: it has a spike to hold it in the ground that is hinged to the plastic.  I have VERY rocky soil and broke one, bought a replacement and broke that one too.  I put in a bolt to replace the pin, which is press-fitted to to the plastic underneath, and it is absolutely fine.  ONLY real shortcoming is that on uneven terrain, the unit can fall over.  If only the wheels were a few inches farther apart it would be PERFECT.  Now if somebody came up with an aftermarket fix for that I would buy it immediately."
5.0,My dad gets way too excited when he watches this thing. He's probably showed it off to all our neighbors in a 3 block radius. Admittedly it is pretty cool but this dude watches it with a huge smile on his face like a kid who's just been told he's going to disney world.
5.0,"What could be simpler.  Loved it so much, I bought two!  Hook up the hose, stretch the hose out in the yard, turn on the water and go drink a beer.  Love the shut off platform at the end.  Best ever if you have more than a 1/2 acre to water."
5.0,For a large yard this is a must and works great.
4.0,i have been useing many types of sprinklers....this 1 arrived today and i have to say its great does a great job my yard is 100 by 150 deep and it covers 90 percent ..
5.0,Got a long and somewhat narrow yard so watering was challenging.  Struggled to get the entire yard watered without moving an ordinary sprinkler.  This is awesome!!  Runs the hose down the yard and shuts off.  No fuss and gets the entire yard.  This thing can even turn corners.  I thought it was broken at first but it just moves really slowly even on the fast speed.  Really like how you can change how far and wide the water goes by adjusting the silver spray ends.  This can even move through thick uncut grass.
5.0,I use these ALL the time!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE them!
3.0,"Works, but not the sturdiest quality."
4.0,Very nicely made and practical tool.
5.0,Shears work well. Pleased with their performance.  Good price.  Recommend this product.
5.0,Best shears we have!
1.0,crap!!!!!!!!
5.0,"Finally, pruning shears that are small enough to fit my hand! I'm an old woman with not a lot of flexibility in my hands, and have trouble finding tools that I can use."
2.0,Connecting screw already broke in less than 2 months
4.0,work great
5.0,"great product.  Sharp blade, comfy handles.  Everything about it is top quality"
4.0,This thing works great for smaller areas where multiple applications are needed. Saves a great deal of time and work when you want to apply liguid fertilizer or herbicide. Well worth the price.
5.0,"Pros
-- This has a well made feel to it.
-- The reservoir is heavy plastic.
-- The brass components are easy to clean and flush for transition between pesticides and herbicides.
-- The sprayer nozzle is also fairly heavy-duty.
-- Utilization of contents seems even and portioned properly by the dial setting
-- Spray pattern is like a wide fan
-- Reservoir pivots so that it is always perpendicular. This is both a plus and minus.

Cons
-- Can not adjust the spray pattern
-- Replacement parts are hard to find (haven't found any yet)
-- No separate cap for the reservoir (it would be nice to remove the sprayer head and leave the chemical in the sprayer capped by a spare cap)

I have a small garden center and we do some spraying when needed. I can treat an acre of growing area, switching off to different hoses for different zones along the way in a very short time. I also feel like the (organic) products that I use are being distributed at a proper dosage and efficiently."
5.0,"This product makes it SO much easier to apply pesticide, herbicide, or fertilizer products to your yard and garden.  It is easy to adjust and fill.  I will never go back to using that damn pump sprayer!"
5.0,this is a nice dispenser for the garden.  it is very handy.  it has a meter that allows different rates of flow.
5.0,"This is a great general purpose sprayer.  I bought it to clean the house with ""Spray and Forget"" after the built-in sprayer on the first quart bottle broke, and it worked perfectly.  Now I can buy the bulk/refill size liquid concentrates (cleaner, fertilizer, etc.) and save money too!  I was very impressed by the overall quality and performance, including the variable ""mixture concentration"" settings ... just make sure you clean it well per the instructions once you're done."
5.0,I've used this to apply insecticide several times and it is easy to use and well made. I did follow the instructions to clean it well after each use and have not had any issues with clogging or leaking.
4.0,"I like this sprayer a lot.  It is so much more convenient to not have to mix the chemicals.  The only thing I do not like about this product is that it is top heavy and you can not just sit the bottle down, it always tips over."
1.0,I bought this unit because it looked better constructed than some of the cheaper ones.  It clogs (even if one strains the material to be sprayed before filling it) and is therefore pretty useless.
5.0,"Have had other sprayers.  This one is easy to prepare mixture ratio and puts out a good fan spray, gets the job done in no time."
5.0,"I have had Gilmour mixers for years.
They have always made spraying easier and quicker.
I recommend them to all my friend gardeners."
5.0,"A bit pricey, but what a great toy, I mean product. Works great and no need to keep moving hoses and sprinklers. made with real iron."
5.0,Good product for an good price.
5.0,So far so good !! I just love not having to move the sprinkler til it is done doing the entire yard !!!! I even run to the store and leave it to do its work !
5.0,"Awesome sprinkler.  Follows hose wherever you put it.  Shuts off wherever you put the ramp.  Adjusted it to cover a 15 foot wide path maybe 25 feet long.  Kids love playing with it while it is running as well.  Well worth the price, this is a solid and well made sprinkler."
5.0,Have had this thing a year and love it. Still works perfectly. I recommend it
5.0,"The best lawn sprinkler made !
Just lay out the hose where you want to treat turn the water on and turn it off when the lawn is done !"
5.0,this sprinkler is well worth the money it works like they said it would it's a little heavy to drag around with a hose but nevertheless worth the money
5.0,"This is by far the best sprinkler I have ever owned. I thought the concept of a moving sprinkler was ridiculous, but this thing is solid and crosses my yard via a 100' 5/8"" hose in about an hour on the high setting. I'd highly recommend this to anyone that needs to manually move a sprinkler to cover their lawn."
1.0,"Cheaply built plastic gears failed in 2 months Replacement 1 month, the gears that make this sprinkler travel is low quailty"
5.0,Excellent coverage and very easy to use!!
3.0,"The metal used to make these doesn't seem to be that strong. Mine cracked after winter at the base. They are cheap and good in a pinch, but they don't make them like they used to. I would consider this disposable. Perhaps they have an upgraded model, but I'd rather put my money on a sure thing."
5.0,nice
5.0,Good quality.
5.0,"An oldie and a goodie.
A great priced, flexible spray nozzle that cant be beat.
Save your money on more expensive nozzles and buy this one right here."
5.0,"It is inexpensive but not cheaply made. Don't expect a $20 nozzle. It works just fine, though, for watering or washing the car."
5.0,good buy
5.0,Simple and effective. Can squeeze softer for softer pressure. Can drop on ground and leave outside in a pile of leaves and won't break.
5.0,Just your traditional water sprayer. no leaks.
5.0,works well
5.0,"I only buy gilmour garden fittings, the quality is unmatched, always a quality product from this manufacturer"
3.0,it's good.  i tried to use w/ miracle gro lawn food and had trouble at first.  you have to mix the lawn food w/ water and then put in feeder or you it won't work.  the bottle is small so you have to refill often.
5.0,Its a budget way to spray but on bigger yards the hose get to be more work. Most yards would be ok. I have a few acers so I use it for smaller places wher I don't want to put it in my pull behind.
3.0,The top opening is too small to allow for easy filling of anything in quantity.  Miracle Grow and similar fertilizer products have to be dissolved in water before adding and then carefully poured into the small top opening.  The sprayer will spray down or up.  On a positive note it does get some distance and power when spraying.
5.0,"I bought this and sat it in a shed for many months -- I am not a go-getter when it comes to taking care of all the fruit trees, roses, etc., especially when it means getting out a bunch of equipment. I'm also too cheap to get pre-mixed chemicals.
When I finally got around to using it, I discovered how suddenly simple it was to use, compared to the backpack style mixer I used previously.

Best thing: pour an the concentrate -- without even measuring it -- adjust the dial, use it, and pour whatever concentrate is left back in its container. Very, very easy. I've been using it regularly since, with noticeable improvements to the trees and plants.

Construction is good -- it's holding up excellently."
5.0,"I needed a sprayer for insect control. I tried 3 other sprayers and not one did what I needed. I needed a sprayer that could send a ""controlled"" but powerful spray up walls, get under the eves, and the option to send a stream 2/3 stories high to reach the furthest peaks and gables. Just seeing the variable control this sprayer has assures me it would work equally as well for other applications, including fertilizer. THIS IS THE UNIT. There are videos on YouTube showing demonstrations of this sprayer. Outstanding sprayer."
4.0,would give this 5 stars butttttttttttt I wish this held a bit more solution and was easier to keep from leaking. Overall it works with any powered or liquid fertilizer. Def recommend this for anyone wanting a quick way to treat their lawn. (plus you cant beat the price!).
5.0,Makes it easy to spray yard chemicals and accurately meter them. Seems to be well made and of good quality.
4.0,"I bought this sprayer because it said it was made in the U.S.A. and has a lifetime guarantee. I was surprised to see MADE IN CHINA  stamped in the handle. It works fine, just a little disappointed that it wasn't all made in the U.S.A."
5.0,easy to use sprayer  and does a great job for spraying many different products around the yard.  have been using this sprayer for years  and can always rely on it for easy use
4.0,It works like it's supposed to.  It's fairly easy to use and since I need more words to describe a plastic sprayer I add these to the mix.
4.0,I've been using it for 2 months and so far no problems. Took a star away because the shut off ramp didn't work. Understand that this for a lawn not a pasture and that there are limits. Make sure that there are no obstructions along the path.
5.0,Bought for our large backyard and it work very well.
5.0,"MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS TRAVELLING SPRINKLER.  It is well-made, easy to set up and a lot of fun to watch... Too bad it has been raining here in the Rocky Mountains so much this month... we haven't needed it.  The only thing better than using this sprinkler I suppose is not needing to water your lawn ever!  We use it on a 15 foot by 50 foot area..... we have experimented with both speeds.  Almost mesmerizing to watch."
1.0,"Did not last a year and the manufacturer does not respond to emails requesting replacement parts under warranty.  The instructions say that the unit must be returned for repair and it's heavy, so it's probably not worth it.  Also, this cannot be used on new lawns because it gets stuck in the mud."
2.0,"The transmissions on these things aren't very durable -- it is a well known issue (google it).  We got 2 seasons out of ours, then we noticed the thing wouldn't traverse the lawn as well.  For this kind of money they should have a more durable system.  Otherwise, we liked it a lot, but for this kind of money they need to figure out this problem figure out a solution."
1.0,"This product failed (completely) on the third time I used it.  When I went out to check on it's progress, it was stalled.  No water was coming out of the arms and the unit was not moving.  After ensuring that there was still water pressure, I turned the water off, checked to be sure that the filter screen was clear, and finding no issues, reconnected it to the hose and turned the water back on.  Still nothing.  So, I have to agree with the others that have had catastrophic failures.  This unit is of extremely poor quality.  Do not waste your money on this unit.  I have ordered the higher priced unit made in the USA and distributed by Rittenhouse."
1.0,"Worked long enough to outlast the return/replacement policy.  My original Nelson watering tractor lasted 8 years, which also had screws that held the body together.  The new defective tractor only cleats together.  Spend the extra $20 and buy it from a local store!"
5.0,"Awesome Device, I use it regularly almost every day during the summer."
3.0,Good.
4.0,Other then getting stuck love it
3.0,"These are very difficult to cut with. Its like they never oiled them from the factory. These cut pretty good though, but for the money i paid I wish they were a little more professional grade."
5.0,"I love my shears, this is my second pair. My husband said that he accidentally lost my other pair that I bought. I have tried others shears and they didn't do a good job, had to work too hard and the others hurt my hands. This time he paid."
2.0,"Very disappointed by the lack of quality. First larger branch (maybe 1/2"") and the blade bent and hits the lower jaw now. Always heard good things about Fiskars, but my experience says otherwise."
5.0,"Works great. I wish it had a hole in the handle though, so I could hang them on a pegboard."
1.0,"These are cheap junk and bend easily, causing you to ruin the blade."
4.0,As expected for the price
3.0,Don't clip as well as some others I have.
5.0,"I admittedly don't do a ton of gardening, but I was very impressed by these Fiskars shears ability to dominate practically any size branch/stem that I could fit into its jaws. I cut down several large branches off a tree in my front yard and when processing it to smaller pieces, these shears could even tackle half-inch thick branches.

I'd say that if you plan on using these for general gardening, cutting flower stems or thick weeds, these bad boys will tear through those tasks. If you need to cut thicker items, these will also do the trick but likely wear them out much faster. When my pair dies, I definitely plan on re-ordering the same pair."
1.0,The most frustrating to use its  blade refuses to stay tight having a inlay nod to keep tightening by a bolt  having no concept in its technology  what so ever.  You never will need to change the blade it never will get worn enough to worry about it
4.0,"Better than most. Now, spring and summer will carry these to do my trimming as shrubs and trees need trimming, Not wait until fall and have to get out the big stuff to trim."
3.0,This doesn't have the spray force I had hoped for or expected.  The connection for the tank to the spray nozzle keeps coming loose and requires tightening as you use it.
1.0,"hate this thing more than anything. I skimped on spending money for a real sprayer so i bought this, what a waste. It took forever to mess with to get it to work, then, screwing around dragging a hose behind me dealt the final blow. The hose dragging may not seem like much but, do that for an period of time and it gets old quick. That hose weighs a lot filled with water lol. Got a backpack sprayer and never looked back since. imo, just spend the money and get a real sprayer"
4.0,"If you're a cheapo like me, you've researched better ways to spray your yard instead of the 1 gallon hand sprayers.  This item is a step up above the big box stores and what they offer.

With this item, you can mix the concentrate that you need, whether it is bug spray, weed killer, or liquid fertilizer.  You hook it up to a hose, dial in the rate you need (based on label of the concentrate), and start spraying your land and yard.  Be aware though, you'll need to move faster than you think as the pressure of the water will use up the concentrate pretty quickly.  However, that means you'll spray your yard really quickly!

The dial on the top could use some work, but the unit itself is very well constructed.  Just moving the dial with your bare fingers is a bit tough.  Grab some gloves so you don't nick your fingers."
5.0,This product is so handy. Never thought I would use it as much as I do. Take any liquid product and make it into a spray. Use it in the yard and on my plants for feeding and pesticides. Love it!
5.0,A commercial grade sprayer that doesn't leak.  This is a quality that is important when applying chemicals.  This is superior in every way to the plastic sprayer I previously had..
4.0,"Works great. Having to soak the thing after use is kind of a pain; wish you could just rinse it out, but I get it. Well made metal parts, not plastic. Definitely above the average."
4.0,"I researched sprayers and more and more.....there is so much junk out there for almost the same price...just get pay a bit more and get something that will last! And save yourself the frustration for sure ! So I did my research and this is what I got!  I am very happy with it..its solid, well made, and will last me a long time taking care of it of course. Great product, works great, as I used it to fertilize my lawn, and weed killer through it....(cleaned it well in between these cycles of course) So if your pondering ?? This is it GET IT ! :) I am happy I did !"
1.0,"Unfortunately, this purchase was a total waste.  I cannot use it in good conscience given the warning label that comes in the box: the brass component (where the water sprays from) contains lead.  I had bought it for fertilizing my vegetables, but who wants to eat lead?  For that matter, who wants to contaminate any soil, anywhere?

I'm not sure how to even dispose of this responsibly."
4.0,"This sprayer does exactly what it needs to do.  It sprays extremely high and far and is also very precise.

The only down fall is if you set the sprayer down and it tips over, whatever you have in the bottle will start leaking out.  Also, it's hard to know which way the dial should face for the setting.

Otherwise, we use it for everything like mold prevention, weed control, and pesticide treatments."
5.0,Works great. Killed every weed in a very large lot behind my house without walking out into them. Seemed to apply the correct amout of product. Best sprayer i've owned. Fast shipping.
5.0,Built well and works excellent. Gives the yard a good soaking
5.0,"Husband loves, works well.  Set it and let it go"
4.0,"just bought a 2nd one. clever idea and works well. just started using it so i can not speak for quality, but seems to be well made"
5.0,This is my second Raintrain.  No problems at all withy first one.  Only reason I had to purchase second one was the first one was no longer in my possession
5.0,It's all I thought it would be.
5.0,Excellent product
5.0,excellent
5.0,The tractor makes my life so much easier.  Set it up and forget about it!!
5.0,Great product...huge timesaver
5.0,One of the coolest sprinklers ever made. Set the track up and let it go. Its so nice not to have to move the sprinkler around. It's very well made and sturdy. Its really heavy as well. I expect this thing to last me years.
5.0,"I have had a pair of these before and loved them! I get a nice clean cut and am able to cut branches up to 1/2"" with ease. The blades don't wobble and it fits comfortably in my hand."
5.0,"Very sturdy build. Sharp blades. Easily cuts through small branches. It's a little on the heavy side, but built to last."
5.0,Great experience
2.0,Made too cheaply.  The item didn't connect and my husband was bleeding.
5.0,Item arrive on time and quality is excellent.
5.0,"Always dependable, always Fiskers."
5.0,Very sharp and functional.
5.0,"Love them, work well"
5.0,I bought a pair of these along time ago and the performance was unbelievable. I had about 10 large trees cut in my yard to let more sunlight in so my grass could grow. I use the firewood in the winter so the tree people left them in my yard. I use the sticks from the branches to help start the bigger logs catch. When I looked at all the those tree piles I said to myself I am going to probably have to re buy a pair if not two. I could not believe it they did the entire job. To get an idea of what they did my nicely stacked twigs and small sticks was 7 feet long and  4 1/2 feet tall. And these were my old pair of Fiskars sheers that I was cutting oak and hickory with not your soft stuff. And yes they were these small ones. Now granted for the larger sticks I used bigger shears but still. When I was done the blade had chipped in spots and was dull and could not be resharpened but they still work! I went to get a new pair to cut flowers with and stuff that needs a sharp blade. I could not believe the prices at the big brand stores in my area. I said let me check on Amazon and honestly they were less than half the price by far! They had other brands that were much cheaper at the stores but they always tore up in a few weeks or months. The quality on these Fiskars sheers are unbelievable! They fit well in the hand and don't leave blisters even after many hours of use. I have nothing but good things to say about these and this price on Amazon is a real bargain! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001@yahoo.com
5.0,"Very sharp, keep away from your fingers :P"
5.0,"gilmour 362 is an excellent product...i like this sprayer...will spray a long ways, trees etc...covers large area in a short time...delivered quickly also.."
5.0,This is a very good sprayer that hardly drips. This has a measuring tool on the top that lets you adjust how much water should pass to get the solution ratio correctly.
1.0,We needed this so we could use the garden hose to spray.  It worked great and we're using it for a lot more things than thought possible.
5.0,"I had borrowed this thing from my buddy so much that he told me I had to order my own or figure something else out.  it works great.  I did notice that because the internals are made of copper, you may have to clean it really good after you put it up for the year."
5.0,"This is an excellent, well-built sprayer which performs flawlessly when the directions are followed properly. It delivers a powerful spray which is strong enough that it can be used safely even when there is a mild breeze. You do have to keep an eye on the bottle so you will know when it has run out of whatever weed killer, etc. you are using. Clean up after each use is essential, but it couldn't be easier - simply fill the bottle with water and spray until it is empty. Then let it dry and it should work fine the next time you need it."
5.0,Have used this product in the past (30 years ago) and had not seen it in a long time.  Works great.  I don't know if it mixes as it should but seems to do so.
5.0,"This is the perfect box elder bug killer.  We get thousands of them in the spring and fall, I load this up with a little dish soap and water and kill them in minutes.  You can take off the tip for a solid stream that hits my second floor peak, and put it back on for a large sheet that clears the walls in seconds.  This is a must for any house with box elders."
5.0,"I purchased this sprayer to spray tall trees and am very happy with it.  It is very rugged and buit to last.  I liked it so much, I ordered one for a relative and he is also happy with it."
4.0,"I've used this with a lawn weed killer and with an herbicide.  The mix was just right according to the dial settings I used and what the instructions said.

With the herbicide, I didn't add anything to the mix.  It was nice to be able to pour the unused remainder back into the original container.

I couldn't do that with the lawn weed killer, unfortunately.  I needed to add a surfactant, so what I had left couldn't go back into the original container.  I just put it into an old plastic bottle for the next time.

Anyway, I consider this a must have item for anyone wanting to keep a lawn.  Just care for it as per the instructions."
5.0,"I was tired of buying a sprayer every year because the previous one stopped working.  This was terrific, easy instructions and worked perfectly.  (Don't forget to clean it when you are finished)."
1.0,Not happy. Doesn't go more then a few feet with out locking up and having to get moved. Not worth the money spend on it
2.0,"Nice sprinkler while it worked. The body is cast iron but that's about it. I didn't mind the wheels being plastic. They make the sprinkler a bit lighter (the body is quite heavy). The block that stops the sprinkler is plastic with a metal stake and feels really cheap. I worried the weight of the sprinkler would push it out of position, but it does its job. The biggest disappointment is with the gears. I should have heeded the reviews about them going bad, but I figured I could probably just replace a gear when it wore out. Wrong. After two seasons the gears are grinding and the entire transmission is one self-contained, made in china, plastic unit that can't be serviced. A replacement is about $20-30 plus shipping.
I was looking for a sprinkler that would last and this isn't it. Instead of sinking any more money on it I'm going to buy an all-metal one from National Walking Sprinkler. Made in my old home state too."
5.0,none
5.0,Great little device to water our entire large lawn
5.0,I live on six acres. so this is AWESOME.... just set it on a 100 foot water hosr and let it go. :)
5.0,nice
3.0,Over priced.  Should have bought locally.
4.0,Heavy as heck. And a lot bigger then you think. Its monster version of the plastic ones. Will hold up very well in the years to come. Not recommended for small yards for the water presure has to be so high to turn the arms to have it move along the hose/path.
1.0,Doesnt work
5.0,"2nd one in 10 years, first one finally rusted and gave up, took 10 years though."
5.0,Way better than every more expensive nozzle I've ever used.  Seems indestructible and works like it should.
5.0,JUST WHAT I WANTED.  WORKS GREAT
5.0,"As expected, works great and well made."
4.0,vary nice hard to find
1.0,"Not for serious use.

This junk lasted about a year.  Then the mechanism went all gummy.  See how in my photo it stays on full power even without squeezing it?  The quest for a durable hose nozzle at any price continues.  I regret my purchase."
4.0,Very happy with purchase and would buy again.
1.0,Poor quality. Neck is literally busted
5.0,"Can't beat it for the money, works great, the only thing I don't like about it is, it is built in China, but I liked it so much I bought another one, hard to find things built in America anymore."
4.0,It shoots out a powerful spray.  My only criticism would be it is hard to get a soft stream unless I turn the tap down a bit.
5.0,Works great just like a simple hose sprayer is supposed to work if you miss the simple days of just having a trusty hose nozzle that stays how you want when you want this is it torque and rugged unlike the new plastic crap.
5.0,I have own and used these for 20 years and have several. Purchase 4 more to use at different properties and give away to friends. Very handy and they do repair them for free for life!!
5.0,"So far I've used this with concentrated Round Up, fruit spray, and a bug spray. It connects to a hose just like a sprayer. There is a little round dial that you set for your concentration. The tip of the sprayer has a little curved, black cover that helps shoot the spray in a slight downward direction. This sprayer has worked great."
3.0,Can be tough to use with certain thick liquids to mix in the container.  I never quite got it to work properly.
5.0,I have tried other sprayers and found this one to be very good. the other hose end sprayers vlogged up and were trouble to use.
5.0,"Finally a well built sprayer.  I bought it because I needed one that you could adjust the mixture rate.  I have used it several times, and as long as you clean it after each use, it will keep working.  I just wish you could adjust the spray pattern a little more.  But overall I like this product."
5.0,"This is the best sprayer I have used. I had one previously that lasted for many years. I was trying to find a replacement locally with no luck. Bought an Ortho Sprayer from Walmart and was totally dissatisfied. So I was truly pleased when I found this on Amazon.
I would certainly recommend this product."
5.0,"Use this for bug spray, herbicide, pre-emerge, you name it.  Love the fact that it is adjustable and only took a little time of measuring my walking speed and the area to be covered to get the output rate for pre-emerge just right.

Had to take it apart only once because I didn't clean it when I should have, but since then, no problems and no leaks."
4.0,"I used the sprayer to apply a herbicide,  when attached to the hose it was easy to use, I have see if the mixture rate set on the dial for the chemical used does the job on the creeping bent grass, It was a lot easier and faster then using the hand pump sprayer for a large area."
5.0,Awesome for being able to control chemical to water ratio.  Spray goes out a good distance.
5.0,"This is such a well-made, durable sprayer.  Adjustable for all your needs and you get such a better product for the price.  Most other models are nothing but plastic components in the sprayer ."
5.0,Exactly as described.  Excellent experience.
5.0,A++++........SELLER
5.0,"These are great.  Keeps lawn nice in the heat of summer.  Great options as far as water distribution.  Fun to watch.  Multispeed.  I have found if I put it on a lower pressure faucet, it may not move on low speed."
5.0,"Overall, I'm very happy with this product.  However, it's more delicate than it leads on.  The outside is heavy cast iron while the transmission and internal gearing is plastic.  I had the product for a couple of weeks, setup with a timer to water at night.  I woke up and the tractor had come off the hose and slowly made its way to the fence.  It sat against the fence spinning its wheels and stripping the internal gears.  The benefit here is that the product has replacement parts; you can basically rebuild the whole thing.  So, I replaced the transmission ($35 I think) and was back in business.

The tractor has 3 speeds (fast, slow and neutral) and the blades are adjustable to change the diameter of water spray.

I'm giving the product 5 stars because it works as expected (except for jumping off the hose once in a while) and repair parts remain available.  Just don't push it too hard (i.e. be sure not to pull too much water hose).  The turning radius requirements are in the instruction manual, but are also right on the back of the tractor."
4.0,"Have had a couple of these and my father also has one. Unfortunately, the guts are plastic/nylon so it is not as durable as hoped. We bought this sprinkler because it was about as cheap as getting replacement parts and repairing the old one. Too bad. My father, however, spent the time to repair his and it is working again.  Hopefully, we can use one of these for parts to repair the other.  Money probably better spent on a cast iron walking sprinkler if you can afford it."
5.0,Used several of these before we installed a sprinkler system.  Still use them in the back yard.  They work well when used as instructed.
2.0,"This sprinkler was supposed to the the only one of it's design to buy but it worked for only a few weeks before the internal gear system failed.  I was told the gear kit is replaceable but after finding that it's all made of plastic I tossed the whole thing in the trash and went back to my old style metal sprinkler.  You'd think, considering the price of these things, that they'd make them better."
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT. CHEAPEST ONLINE
5.0,good product good value
5.0,"Works great but on fresh seeding where mud can develop it can churn without advancing.  If you use a hose with an extension hose, it can hang up and not advance at the coupling of the two hoses.  Turns should be a wide arc of the hose and not right angles, approximating 45 degrees.  The spinning arms are adjustable but turning them down slows the advance speed and can muddy the areas. Best watering method I've used without constantly changing sprinklers. Covers a wide area quite evenly."
4.0,Sharp lasts and cuts thick vines easily.
5.0,Great product. Very sharp
5.0,Good grip. Strong and sharp.  Excellent gift for the new married couple with a big back yard.
5.0,"Sharp, efficient, and gets the job done! I love this powerful tool...handheld and allows me to finish my gardening faster, which is always a plus. Great bonus to have in your gardening set."
5.0,"Great deal, good product."
5.0,These pruning shears are great! I have used them on flowering plants and bushes around my house. The shears have been sharp for me and I have not had any problems with them! I also love the lock on the shears to help keep them stored safely.
5.0,Work great
1.0,Dulls quickly
5.0,My go to garden tool. Fiskars is top quality.
4.0,"Works well on most things, but like many clippers, smaller, stringy type plants seem to get turned sideways instead of cutting. It still works better than most of the cutters I have used over the years."
5.0,"Remove the old, attach the new. The old one was a DRUMM multi nozzle that started leaking like crazy, so I decided to come ""bacl to basics"" and so far, so good. This nozzle fits a 3/4 connection - this is pretty standard. Had no problem to adjust it - wasn't even necessary.
I'd like to find only the nozzle, to screw on the tip of this one... but so far, so good."
5.0,Very nice value priced unit. Excellent fit and finish.
5.0,03/26/2018  For the price does every thing any other sprayer does.  I have used and all ok.  wjc
4.0,The cheap ones are almost always better.
5.0,Perfect nozzle with great control.
3.0,"Item did not include the rubber o-ring  (or  hose gasket).  Without this, the nozzle leaks no matter how tight you screw it onto the hose.  I  don't know if  Gilmour is super cheap and no longer includes the rubber gasket  or if  this is just a packing error."
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"Very sturdy nozzles with almost all metal parts, hopefully it will over last all my previous plastic ones."
4.0,Works as expected.
4.0,Hopefully it holds up as well as the one my grandma had when I was growing up!! Seems pretty well made if something breaks itll be the spring.
5.0,"this is a good item, great disbursement control.  best hose end sprayer i have bought....highly recommend.....you should buy this today"
5.0,Great quality. Doesn't seem flimsy at all. I use it to spray weed concentrate. I've already made my money back.
1.0,it had the leaking problem since the first day i ordered another one had the same problem chinese made cheap quality .
5.0,this is the esiest applicator i have ever used.  It is almost hasle free and mess free. Easy to clean and store.
5.0,"This thing really performs as described, no pre-mixing and a snap to clean. It is easier than using the spreader."
5.0,"I have a small green house and I use I all the time
Easy to use and clean
Good product"
5.0,"The sprayer worked great right of the box.  No leakage at all.  Someone previously mentioned problems understanding the mixing proportions for dry water soluble fertilizer.  The ration is 5 ounces of water to whatever amount per gallon.  The ratio that I use is 5 to 1 (5:1).  In other words. five ounces of water to one tablespoon of fertilizer.  Your ration might be 5 to 2(5:2); five ounces of water to two tablespoons of fertilizer.  When you spray the five ounces, that is the equivalent of one gallon of premixed spray. The bottle itself is marked for up to fifteen ounces.  The setting on the sprayer should be set at ten.  Hope this helps."
5.0,Best sprayer I've ever owned! You won't be sorry buying it. Clear instructions and I really like the way you can spray app. 30 ft. straight up
5.0,"The sprayer performs extremely well. It is easy to understand, easy to adjust, and easy to clean. The spray pattern works in a 360 degree manner making it possible to hit any area at any angle.  Lightweight yet durable. Worth the money, especially when getting professional results."
4.0,"This product works exactly as described straight from the box. Perfect for concentrated bug or weed spray.
Only down side is that there are a few small parts that Gilmour doesn't offer replacement for."
1.0,"I have to of these Both broken unless to watch it all the time it will get stuck and it has ?gears that make it impossable to replace  the water driven ""motor""  AND unless you have a machine shop.. the large wheels will not come off for a replacement motor ..flip it on it's back and stuff flowers in it LOL LOL"
2.0,The plastic gears will break in a heart beat if you let the grass get too high. Need to find a better build one soon.
5.0,"This is a great way to keep a big lawn watered. We haven't installed a sprinkler system yet but needed to plant some new grass. This kept it watered and is actually kind of fun to watch-my Grandkids thought it was ""magic""!"
1.0,The spray arms were not included in the box. It is completely useless without those pieces! What a waste of money! Now I need to buy replacement parts before I can even use the sprinkler.
4.0,"Never fails with a guy without in ground sprinklers, keep eye on it once in a while , cause off she goes on her own when jumps the hose."
1.0,This is not worth the money.  The one I bought broke within 3 weeks!
4.0,"Have not tried this item as winter has arrived here in Colo.  this was a replacement for a  Nelson which was backed over by a delivery truck.  The previous model was tremendous and provided years of reliable service  This unit appears to be sturdy and well made although not quite as heavily constructed.  Generally, we expect the same level of performance from this unit. We rated it some what less than perfect because of the lighter gauge metal and the stop device is quite different than the one we previously used. We hope that it will stand up to the task."
4.0,works great
5.0,Great sprinkler!
5.0,Basically a train set for adults!
5.0,The hand grip is very nice for smaller hands as well as giving the power necessary for small branches.
4.0,These are strong and work great. Just what I needed to get the pruning done on my roses and help make faster harvesting of small veggies in the garden. Easy to use with one hand and lock the blades closed.
5.0,"good quality, easy to handle, cuts nicely."
5.0,Works quickly and efficiently to trim small branches.
5.0,Works great
4.0,Work great.
5.0,You get what you pay for! Fiskars are great quality!
5.0,Good quality.
4.0,As advertised.  Sturdy.
5.0,These things will cut through just about anything! I love them!! I would definitely recommend this product.
1.0,"I bought the Gilmour because it was recommended to use with the Spray & Forget House & Deck product. When it came, we could not figure out how to convert the measurements to use the product in this sprayer. When I called Customer Service at Spray & Forget I was told that I CANNOT USE THIS SPRAYER with their product!! They don't know who linked it here on Amazon and they have been trying to get it unlinked to no avail. So, if you are buying SPRAY & FORGET products, DO NOT BUY THIS Gilmour Sprayer!!"
5.0,I bit difficult to adjust but that means once you have it set that it stay set. Easy to clean.
5.0,This is an exact replacement of an older Gilmore sprayer. It's easy to use and clean. I've been able to get up pretty high when spraying my trees which is a plus. It has a spreader nozzle for lawns or whatever. It's of good quality and looks like it will last.
1.0,"I just wanted to let people know that the brass part of this hose-end sprayer contains lead.  The warning label on the sprayer states: ""This product contains lead, a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.  Do not place your hands in your mouth after handling product.  Do not place the product in your mouth.  Wash your hands after touching this product.""
  I decided to return this product because I was planning on using it on my organic vegetable garden and I don't want to take the chance of lead leaching into my soil, then into my plants and then into me.  I wish they would have told me about the lead before I bought it."
5.0,"This is the best Garden sprayer I have ever had. Works like it is suppose to, and easy clean up."
5.0,"BEEN USING THIS MODEL SPRAYER FOR OVER 30 YEARS TO SPRAY APPLE, PEACH, PEAR, GRAPES AND ANYTHING ELSE IN THE YARD AND GARDEN. NOTHING BETTER FOR THE DAILY SPRAYING IN SUMMER"
5.0,This sprayer works extremely well! I use it to fertilize my flower beds in the summer. You just put the liquid in the sprayer dial it to the correct dosage and spray away. No wasted fertilizer as you can pour that back in the bottle. I have used fish emulsion fertilizer in it and was concerned it may clog up the sprayer but that didn't happen. It works perfectly!
5.0,"My old, now not functioning sprayer had a tank about twice the size. It no longer works, so thus this purchase. All this means is three fill ups instead of two to spray my lawn, not a big deal."
4.0,Used to spray my one apple tree--works really well--mix was easy--should have bought this a long time ago. The apples are happy too.
4.0,"I picked this up to use as a pseudo-power washer for my stucco wish a TSP/bleach mix.  It worked fairly well, but I was left with some clumping in the bottom of the container as it sucked up the fully dissolved solution and left the undissolved granules.  This type of sprayer will not mix water into the solution, but merely pull it out with a siphon effect.  I can't blame the design, only my own negligence for not reading into the details.  All in all, it works well and puts out a nice directional fan of water/mix at a decent pressure that can be used for a variety of purposes."
4.0,"Happy Happy Joy Joy! It was just as it was advertised, so it gets four stars, what else is there to say! They would get five stars if they went above and beyond what was advertised and expected.

Imagine if your grocery store was like Amazon, and you had to rate every product you purchased! How annoying would that be?"
5.0,Better than my old green one.  Seems to go a little slower so I get a little more water on the lawn.
5.0,This product works great.  No issues at all after 1 year.  Very solid.
5.0,Works very good. Wish I had gotten it sooner.
5.0,Perfect for windy climates.
1.0,"I bought myself and my sons each one, they aren't made like they used to be,they sold to a different company and the new company put plastic parts instead ,all 3 of them were junk within a year, my neighbor still had his he bought 15 yrs ago when they were made with steel parts."
5.0,"We have two traveling sprinklers--one is another brand. One of the originals (not Nelson's) that we bought worked fine for one season and then this spring, one of them just stopped working.  Our new Nelson has been wonderful this past summer and is visibly better than the older sprinkler that we have.  More solidly built, better range, etc.  My husband and I are really happy with this sprinkler and will probably buy another one next spring. We have more than an acre of ground that they have to cover and the Nelson's are real work horses.  Highly recommend."
4.0,"Pretty good sprinkler. Easy to set up, but feel the spray wands are a little cheap for a metal sprinkler. Could be my water pressure, but seems to get easily hung up when it first starts off. Satisfied with it."
5.0,So happy to find this item!  My husband had one a few years ago and it was lost...not sure how.  He loves the quality of the sprinkler.  It saves so much hand watering in a yard that has no sprinklers.
5.0,Proud to own it.
3.0,ok not great
5.0,Excelente la recomiendo
3.0,"These worked well for a short time, but broke after a handful of uses."
5.0,"These work great on helping me to prune my flowers and baby bushes.  The comfort grip on these makes it for a relaxing day by the garden, I forget I am even pruning my plants"
2.0,Worked well for 1 week and then the blade bent and they won't close.  I've used this style for years and never had a problem.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,Anything Fiskars is high quality.
5.0,Does the job. Feels good in the hand.
5.0,"Great product, have used them in the past. Good price too."
4.0,work great so far. nice and sharp
5.0,"I found this by chance, and for me it is a true miracle.
Cleaning out the basement has never been easier, I just fill this thing with soap, connect to a house, turn the volume dial to the highest, and the place smells delicious."
5.0,"I use this sprayer to water the lawn with concentrated Bifen XTS.
It kills the sod web worms that have been so hard to get rid of here in Florida."
5.0,this is a quality product and works well at dialing in your delievery rate.  i was attempting to spray my yard with a cutter bug control in the store bought bottle.  it was horrible.  i was able to dump the concentrate into the gilmour 362 and effectively spray my yard with a heavy application!  next i will use the professional grade pest/bug control i purchased called demand CS.
5.0,"I wanted something to use to apply insect killer to the outside of my house.  I also didn't want to have to stop and pump every 5 minutes.  This gadget does the trick.  I hope you're good at math, though.  Figuring proper proportioning can get a little nerve wracking,
Instructions are included, so we fellers can get our wives to read them for us and help us."
5.0,I use this to apply chemicals to my lawn. It works very well except with very viscous liquids. Once I thin such liquids with a little water it works just fine.
5.0,"I ordered this with the expectation that it would be the best value for the average home owner.  Unfortunately, it arrived non-functional.  It was cross-threaded between the canister and the spray gun.  I tried to correct this, but the parts are plastic, and were ruined.  Additionally the spray gun did not completely shut off when released.  All of this made the unit worthless.

I called the customer service telephone line, hoping to take advantage of their lifetime warranty (vs. Amazon return).  I was instructed to send copies of the sales receipt to their generic email.  I was also told that the units are handmade, and sometimes this happens.  No further explanation.

1 week after emailing, a package arrived.  No fanfare, just a replacement unit.

I tested it today, and it is exactly what I expected.  The best value for the discriminating homeowner.  Perfect and highly recommended."
5.0,"Works well ,Easy to use except removing small plastic nozzle and small refill hole. Quality of product appears very good.
Good day."
4.0,"Was much easier to use than the 2 gallon tank sprayer I originally tried to distribute flea poison over my yard.,"
1.0,"used it right out of the package,  More water came out of the base of the sprayer then the nozzle the little gold piece on the top fell off.  had to look in the grass for that for 20 minutes... RETURNED!"
5.0,"Having wanted a sprayer for a while now, I was reluctant to buy one of the all plastic ones found at my local farm type store. I found this one on Amazon, read the reviews and decided to order one. I have used it 5 or 6 times so far this year and it works great. I do always follow the manufacturers advice and ensure it is thoroughly cleaned after each use. With the quality construction I expect to have this sprayer for mant more years."
4.0,"I really like the raintrain traveling sprinkler. It works well. I am so happy I do not have to run out and change a sprinkler every 30 min. The only thing is that it is a little heavy but has to be to dig in and travel along the hose. It does not work real well on long grass, but if you push the hose down in the grass, it goes good. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,good for a lawn but not for a riding ring.
4.0,It was just as I had remembered it.  Fantastic.
2.0,"Had this sprinkler for 4 years now and went through 3 gear boxes. The last one tore up after 3 runs. It got stuck on the shutoff ramp and stripped the gears. I liked the sprinkler when it worked but, I'm done with it now, I'm through, with buying gear boxes, it's a waste of money. I could have bought a National for the money spent on the Nelson to date, check National Walking Sprinkler website they have different models for different prices."
5.0,Sprinkler works great!! Shipped quickly!!
5.0,"This sprinkler has been a great asset to our lawn care, it sets up easy enough and does a great job watering a huge area. Not sure how many seasons it will last but it feels heavy duty and we got our money's worth this year already."
5.0,Works great.
5.0,"We have found this to be by far the best sprinkler on the market.  Sturdy, and just set it and let it go.  I would recommend the Raintrain."
5.0,This unit replaced one that was nearly forty years old.  This one works just as well as its predecessor.
5.0,"good price, good delivery, very satisified"
5.0,These are great. Fill bottle and set desired strength and spray.  Makes home pest control and weed control a breeze
5.0,"I purchased this item to spray soluble fertilizer on my garden. The mixture I'm using is somewhat viscous, about midway between the consistency of water and molasses. As such, it was not siphoning properly...well, not siphoning at all would be more accurate. I found that for my purposes, I had to remove the small filter screen at the bottom of the siphon hose, once that was done the mixture flowed properly and everyone lived happily ever after."
5.0,"So we bought this for our mother in law, she loved it. I guess you really cant go wrong with an item like this."
5.0,"These metered sprayers make proper application of liquid chemicals (fertilizers, killers, controllers) a snap.  The meter allows very finite amounts per gallon.  It has a spray lock, so you don't have to continually squeeze the handle AND you can make amounts per gallon even more finite by changing the position of the me tering screw on top.  Easy to handle and clean.  I love mine and my yard looks great."
1.0,"I have not yet tried this sprayer so cannot state how well it will work.  There is some kind of material caught in the filter basket that fits at the bottom of the siphon tube.  Until I can get this material out, I doubt that the sprayer will work well.  I deliberately bought some items from Amazon used to try to save money and my guess is this was one of those items.  If so, the reason the previous owner may have returned it is they tried to use it improperly with a dry material and it clogged the filter causing failure of operation.  The filter basket should have been checked at the warehouse before repackaging and sending out the refurbished unit.  So far I have not been able to budge the material from the filter basket with a Qtip.  I'll have to try other methods."
5.0,Love this sprayer. Not having to mix any chemicals beforehand is a plus. I've had plastic handle ones in the past and they were really junk and never lasted. This one is solid and professional grade. I highly recommend this sprayer.
5.0,"I have used numerous sprayers as a golf course superintendant and I am sure that any home gardner such as myself will find that the Gilmore 362 sprayer will meet and exceed there best expectations. I have used the Gilmore 362 sprayer several times and have not had any problems with it. I would recommend the sprayer to anyone that is looking for a quick and easy way to spray ther gardens, trees,shrubbery and flowers. It is well constructed and the nice thing is that you can order replacement pasts straight from Gilmore."
5.0,"I had one and lost it in the garage or lent it to someone, this is a replacement item. Great for spraying chemical around the property."
4.0,"I bought this to squirt washing solution on my solar panels after giving up on a pressure washer.  WOW - this does a really great job.  You have to take off the plastic disperser to get distance (the top of my panels are about 25 feet away) but it does a really terrific job.

My only complaint is I haven't found a way to keep it from tipping over when I store it.  So I do have to empty it after each use.  Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars."
4.0,"Satisfactory performance, bought it to spray an apple tree in my backyard and so far it has been performing well"
5.0,trims well. i love these
5.0,Good product
4.0,Nice pruner
5.0,I was able to successfully chop my finger off with just one cut! These shears are great!
5.0,"Always the highest quality.  Clean cut, easy pressure to make cuts, even larger ones."
5.0,Received very quickly.  Pleased with these shears.
5.0,"fiskers is to pruning what butter is to toast. twigs, sprouts and limbs melt like butter"
5.0,Excellent product very well made.
5.0,Fiskars are the best. Very solid and super sharp. I was able to prune branches up to 1/4 inch on muliple bushes for about an hour with zero hand fatigue!
3.0,"Okay so I bought this pair of medium duty bypass pruners at the same time as the Fiskars light duty bypass pruners.

And to tell the truth the light duty pair are better

When I use these I need the light duty pair as well. because for me these only cut branches around 1/3 inch in diameter any less than that and they don't cut properly!

The woods they work well on are:  Maple/Crepe myrtle /peach /and Bradford pear They hate pine /cypress /oak and more.

Pros:

Works well on some branches 1/3 inch in diameter.

Good hand feel.

Strong blade.

Cons

 Will not work on twigs.

They squeak even when oiled.

 Id give it 2 out of 5 on twigs.

And 4 out of 5 for the things they actually managed to cut.

Would I recommend these?  Most likely not.

I might try to get a replacement from Fiskars in case this pair is just a dud.

Oh and a little tip:  its a good idea to wipe the blades and moving parts with a lightly oiled rag or paper towel to prevent rust and help keep the blades sharp.

Thanks for reading my review!"
5.0,We love this Traveling Sprinkler. They wanted 4k for underground sprinklers. This does the job just as well
4.0,Does a good job of watering a large area. Doesn't go well in dirt or straw (trying to grow grass)...the wheels will tend to spin with the weight of the hose. I had to go out and move the tractor out of the hole several times and pull the hose up so it would continue to travel. I was probably trying to do more than the tractor was design to do. Probably meant more for established lawns. Does shut off automatically.
5.0,Love it. It's windy we're I live and this works great even in the wind.
4.0,I have two of these. They do a good job. They will pull a lot of hose. I use quick connects on my hoses so once they pass a connector I will remove a hose. I lay out about 250' of hose in the back yard. You have to be careful about using smaller flimsy hoses and don't make corners too sharp or it will jump off the hose.
3.0,"So sad to see it was made in china ,.........."
5.0,"Works great, thanks."
4.0,I was a bit sceptical when I looked at this sprinkler but it has performed as promised!
5.0,love it
5.0,I am surprised but this product has held up well for a few years already.
5.0,alot better than Orbitz.
5.0,Best hose nozzle available.
4.0,Simple. Basic design. Good for washing the car and watering flowers. Great price!
5.0,good productcheap pricelike it
5.0,Nice basic hose nozzle.
5.0,Wish it was made in the US but what can you do.
1.0,"Every time you need to lay the nozzle down for whatever reason it WILL land on the spray lever and send a stream of water right at you leaving you soaking wet, especially in the winter months. This is Murphy's Law with any rear trigger garden sprayer and believe me, there is nothing you can do to prevent it. It will get really old really fast too, unless of course you actually like being unexpectedly soaked to the bone every time you need to use your hose. Get one that has a FRONT trigger and this won't happen,

You're very welcome!"
5.0,Well made.  Sturdy. Easy to control flow.
5.0,squirts fine
5.0,For the money these work great! I have bought costly hose sprayers and tried this. I am glad I bought this and works great!
5.0,All good. Classic product. They work good!
5.0,Couldn't have asked for a better sprayer.  Works great  with a hose' gets the job done and seems very durable.
5.0,"Like others, I had problems over the years with the Miracle Grow sprayer, and stopped using it. With the Gilmore sprayer, no problems at all. It states that it is for use with liquid products, but the Miracle Grow products that are in granular form, dissolve very easily and can be used in the Gilmore sprayer. I used the lawn fertilizer in it and and it worked great. Also easy to use because it's lightweight."
5.0,"One of the best tools I have purchased.  Well made, easy to use.  Does the job quickly.  Well worth the price."
5.0,"I was skeptical at first, but after reading reviews and wanting to try something different... this was a good and cheap investment. For years, I have been using and constantly buying 2gallon sprayers, in which only lasts 1 season because the wands always either cracks or leaks. Sometimes its hard to measure out correct amount of formula.. Can't believe I have been wasting all these years, now I stumbled on such a simple & convenient  gadget as the glimour nozzle sprayer. I have used this so far 2 times, for killing weeds & grass from asphalt driveway &  rocked driveway. Very easy setup, pouring the correct amount in ounces & setting dial to 10. Works out great so far, very fast & easy spray results than using pumped sprayers. In my opinion this also sprays evenly.
Where the grass area meets the graveled rock drive, I can spray evenly & line the sprayer very well. I haven't tried using this in other instances, but  in this circumstance, this works great.... now after my first spray, I do get a small amount of leak of water running down hose... but this is a very well solid sprayer.... Very highly recommend this."
4.0,Works well .  It's a sprayer. Does what it should. Won't stand up with the handle on it and leaked stuff out but the handle should have been removed after use.
5.0,"Easy to use, solid and a great even spray - great deal for the money and feel like it will last a long time much better than the all plastic ones."
5.0,"Our old sprayer we had gotten for free finally bit the dust.  Went looking for a new one and almost made a purchasing error...but fortunately, read reviews here and found the Gilmour 362.  He has used it a few times now, and LOVES it.  Very well built, easy to use (does take reading the instructions carefully) and has a great spray pattern and spray power.  We are fighting two-spotted spider mites with everything we have...and the spray from this is powerful enough to help knock the pests off the bush as well as deliver whatever agent we put in it."
4.0,"Several reviews mention leaking, but mine works fine with no leaks - the two spray options are just what I need...fine downward broad spray and stronger stream - I use it to kill weeds that grow in the cracks of my long asphalt driveway - I deducted one star because dilution range isn't large enough for concentrated Roundup - Roundup requires 12 Tablespoons per gallon and the sprayer only goes to 10 Tablespoons per gallon - that's a glaring design flaw that it can't accommodate such a common chemical that this sprayer would be used for - I just finished spraying it at 10 Tbsp. per gallon, which might work anyway...we'll see - this beats the pump-up sprayers for ease of use"
5.0,Works great.  I did not keep the other one rinsed out after every use and had to buy a new one.  If I take care if this one it should last a long time.  Really feeds the plants on the ground and thru the leaves.
2.0,"I thought this would be great for foliar feeding as well as spraying things like neem oil. However, the spray is too strong for my vegetable garden and there is no real way to reduce it. I could turn the water down, but then it will not mix the solution properly because it won't have enough pressure. It also leaks, so I had water dripping down my arms. It might be fine for spraying lawns, but I don't need anything for that so it was a waste of money."
5.0,these are the only clippers I'll ever use
3.0,"Get what you pay for, it works, it's sharp. not fond of the skinny type metal they use nowadays. It will get trimmings jammed in the blade once in a while. While it can open nice and wide, it doesn't quite do it on it's own, you have to help whatever spring it has. Always wanted to try a Fiskars, had heard so much about them, didn't realize this one was made in China...not sure if that's the problem or just the specs. I'll keep it, like I said, for the price it's not bad. Next time I'll spend more and find a better product."
5.0,"Had had a pair before but lost them, works great and delivered in a prompt manner"
5.0,Awesome tool that does the job. Very sharp and very well made. Highly recommend it.
5.0,Great for those little gardening jobs. Cleans up well and stores easily.
4.0,Work just ok
5.0,I love these Fiskars shears. They are as good or better than more expensive ones I have owned . I am very happy with them.
5.0,Great tool.
5.0,Hardly need to use that much pressure great for pruning branches would buy again
3.0,"These jam up too easily on simple tasks. Next time, I'll opt for something better."
5.0,"Sprayer that sprays things where I point it as long as I have hooked the hose up properly, which is kind of a pain since they didn't add a little hose connection at the bottom. You either turn the sprayer or the hose. But, it sprays."
5.0,"This product did what I wanted.  I had a row of privet hedge that has been there for 100 years, I cut it back but it continually crept closer and closer.  This hedge was 15 foot tall and so thick it had grown impossible to cut back.  I bought the sprayer that attaches to the hose.  I filled the sprayer bottle, set it to spray on 10, it sprayed a wide path to the tops of the brush.  I soaked the entire row in less than 15 minutes, and 6 days later all the leaves have dropped and nothing's left but the trunks and sticks, making them easy to cut.  When I cut these sticks I will paint the stumps for maximum effectiveness.  Do not spray on windy days the spray will drift, cover your head and wear a breathing mask and glasses.  The spray is not really toxic to animals or birds as I understand it, but do not spray around their water.  Shut your animals up until it dries, don't take any chances.

This will not kill every varieties but it does get rid of privet hedge.......I did notice the drift destroyed the chickweed in my yard."
4.0,"The sprayer works fine, though the hose fitting is an American thread which I couldn't get in the UK. I had to modify the sprayer. There didn't seem to be anything of this calibre though available in the Uk."
5.0,This is really working great compared to similar items I've purchased in the past.  Has a wider and stronger spray which cuts down application time.  Just wish the bottle was a bit bigger but not really and issue since it's easy to refill.  Will definitely take others advice about cleaning it after each use to prevent clogging.
5.0,"Out here in Texas flatland where nearest store if 40 miles away, if you can find it then, Price is good, product does exactly as it was described. strong;, and easy to use"
2.0,"I need to mix dry chemicals and followed instruction, 1st time it worked good , 2cd use did the same thing, but the unit did not spray the proper amount of chemical it's  too lean.  Ortho sprayette has it beat as a hose end sprayer, but is no longer made.  It did spray about 20-25feet , I'd earlier purchased a Gilmour 486 model, useless only sprays 12 feet at the most I'm trying to spray apple trees, product not as advertised.  It would be nice if some one could design a fool proof hose end sprayer that does distance  at least 25 feet and works well with liquid or powdered chemical.  I did rinse the unit out and it's not plugged"
5.0,I love my Gilmour sprayer.  I can't believe that in forty years of gardening we were not introduced sooner.  Saves so much time.
1.0,"The bottle was made in America!  That's it.  The rest  stamped ""MADE IN CHINA"".  Broke after the second or third time using.."
4.0,"First time I used it I realized that the tablespoons per gallon of water dial was difficult to set. The marking of where to set it was hard to find. In still not 100% sure I have it set right.

The spray is wide and cannot be changed or adjusted. I don't mind this much. It soaks my plants well. It's also top heavy.

I have been rinsing it out after every use like another reviewer suggested and I have not had any clogging.

I love that I can pour my solution unmeasured right into it. And then back into the bottle of fertilizer when I'm done.

This has been the easiest way for me to fertilize my garden. I love it!"
5.0,My old one wore out after about 20 years.  I got another and it's better than ever!!  Don't waste money on the products in Lowe's and Home Depot - this tops them all including the expensive models!!
1.0,"Had one for a decade, loved it. Bought a new one, box said made in china. Product is now cheap plastic junk. New one had problems first time I used. Stay away."
5.0,"Covers the back or the front of my 1 acre yard in one pass, and shuts itself off when it's made the trip.  $55 for this sprinkler or $5,500 for an in-ground system?  Nothing to think about!"
4.0,"After a summer of use, I am quite satisfied with this traveling sprinkler.  Seems very durable."
3.0,Tough going up even the slightest slope. It does the job but not without help. Not as automatic as I had hoped. Only recommend for flat or level lawns.
5.0,Like it
4.0,"Love, love, love my little tractor.  Just attach the hose, turn on the water, and let it go.  However, you do need to keep an eye on it.  Sometimes goes off track, can get stuck in the mud, and sometimes does not turn itself off...but I totally forgive it.  Would not trade it for anything because it's so fun to watch it doing it's job, happily chugging across our parched lawn.  Would like to have about 3 more but I would get nothing done during the day.  Love this heavy weight, cast iron critter that has watered its way into my heart."
5.0,It does exactly what I hoped it would do for me. An excelle4nt product.
5.0,loved it
5.0,Works just like it should.
5.0,Works great!!
5.0,A++++ great product!
5.0,"We used these on our Haas VF2, VF4, and UMC750s to replace their faulty ones. They work like a charm and don't leak."
5.0,Works great
5.0,"I love it, old school and works great."
5.0,Great durable everyday hose nozzle.  Have used them for years.  They do get hot in the sun.
5.0,this is my favorite cleaner sprayer.  it is so durable and doesnt leak.  I bought 2 of them.  I would give these out as gifts to people.  You can't go wrong with this sprayer.
4.0,What can I say? It squirts water. Should cost less.
1.0,Less than a month of light use and it cracked.
4.0,Worked!
5.0,"Best having a metal heavy duty handle, than these plastic ones the local stores carry"
5.0,"I have used various garden and tree hose-end sprayers for 20 plus years. Most of the hose-end sprayers are made cheaply, like the Ortho products. They are made completely from plastic and fail after the first season usually. The most critical part of hose-end sprayers is the numbered dialing disc that allows the fluid to be siphoned at various amounts based on the manufacturer's formula, i.e. 2 tablespoons of chemicals per gallon of water.

The Gilmour professional hose-end sprayer head is made from brass and comes with a nozzle attachment that allows the spray to fan out for lawns or bushes. If you want a long distance spray for trees, just remove the attachment. Also this sprayer allows you to add chemicals without premixing them. Anything left over, just pour it back into its container.

I bought two of these sprayers, one for my trees and one for my lawn. I highly recommend this product,"
5.0,This is the perfect device for spraying trees (worms) and for spraying high spots on the house exterior before pressure washing.  I prefer not running bleach through my pressure washer and this is a great substitute.  It takes a little longer but it does a better job and mitigates corrosion of the pressure washer fuel pump.
4.0,"1.  Works well.  Good instructions.  Mostly brass.  Will easily reach a second story window.

2.  Really needs a bigger jar option.  If you were doing a large lawn, you might be doing a lot of refilling.

3.  Always clean/rinse out after use.  Residual chemicals drying in the nozzle will clog it.  Easier to do before than after.

4.  Some hose-end sprayers ready-to-use have a short range (making them difficult to use) but don't tell you what their mix ratio is.  Have to call them.  Even them some say they don't know.

I recommend it & would buy it again."
5.0,"I had a cheap plastic sprayer that worked pretty well, but eventually fell apart.  I decided to replace it with a more quality product.  This one is very nice.  It works extremely well and sprays both a wide short broadcast or a long stream to reach into trees.

I used it to spray Permethrin spray for mosquitoes, flies, and ants.  The combination is fantastic.  Great product, good price."
1.0,If what you want to spray has a higher viscosity than water. This is not the sprayer for you. Look elsewhere.
5.0,My Yellow Delicious tree came up with cedar rust fungas and this sprayer (with alittle help from a step ladder) let me get my fungicide to the top and through out the leaves. It also has settings for teaspoons or tablespoons per gallons so you can set your delivery rate as needed.
5.0,I used this to spray Permethrin around the outside perimeter of the house.  We have lots of flower beds and hedges with lots of mulch and the roach population living in the mulch was starting to make its way into the house.  We are talking those big outdoor roaches.  What I like about this sprayer is that it requires no premixing.  You set the dial for the number of tablespoons/gallon required and go to town.  It distributes the product very well.  Clean it after it use and should last a long time.
2.0,"my husband said it leaked all over the place, until he discovered it was missing an o ring which seals the sprayer to the bottle. Once he cut his own seal from a rubber inner tube, he said it worked just fine."
5.0,"I've only used this a few times, but it worked with bleach and well dissolved OxyClean.  The flow control worked very well and I was able to get a high enough concentration for OxyClean sprayed to kill mildew on the side of my house.  It wasn't strong enough to kill mildew on my roof though.

My only complaint is that the reservoir isn't bigger.  Otherwise, it's well built, works as expected and I would buy again."
5.0,"Have had one for over 20 years, but now I have 3, marked the bottles for use for weed and feed, round-up and bug spray.
Makes it very handy."
4.0,"Always wanted one of these, and it works great. the auto shut shut off works great. follows the hose with no jump offs. I do have a flat yard. haven't tried it on curves yet. Now it's just a matter of seeing how it lasts. Hopefuly will get acouple of years use before having to replace parts. At least you can order all breakable parts. Recommend! *******Update 17 April 2017  Well the gear box went out today on my sprinkler. just quit spinning while it was working great. Had an old onr from my son in law gave me that was ten years old that the wheels were falling apart on so was plenty used. Took out the transmission and put in back in mine and its running great again. Am still happy with it but suspect thats a weak spot on the newer ones like mine."
1.0,"This used to be a quality product, but... Internal gears are now made of very cheap material and break quickly. I have gone through two of these in the last three years. Instead of moving they just sit there and click as the gears slip over each other. Now very high priced junk, don't buy this unless you are prepared to spend $85 every 2-3 years!"
5.0,"I have used these sprinklers for over 20 years and they are hands down the best!!! We have very hard water and it just takes it and keeps going.  My last one is still working but it is very old so I thought it was time to purchase a new one.  You won't be disappointed with this sprinkler, especially if you have a lot of yard to water.  I set it and leave and come home and it is off.  I love it!!!"
5.0,works as good or better than the one it replaced
1.0,"I have had one of these for 5 years. In concept it should be a Joy to own.  The cheap plastic gears strip easily, I am on my 5th replacement set. the tractor jumps off the smaller diameter hose, making the bigger heavier hose  the choice. Hence the cheap plastic gears strip more easily from pulling the heavier hose.  Also the plastic ramp does not always shut off the tractor. Customer support from ""Bosch"" yes it is a Bosch owned company is poor!."
5.0,These things are great.
5.0,"Nothing better if you have an established yard that is hard to water.  It doesn't pull heavy hose well that is really long, so I go out and pull the hose through and it goes on its Merry way."
5.0,"Tractor Sprinkler, where have you been all my life!  for 16 years i have tried various sprinklers and sprinkler systems (like multiple hoses) and I just got tired of dragging hoses around in the dark (I'm in Texas and water at night).  16 years and never knew about this beauty...until my cousin reminded me my Grandfather used to own one.  I bought it and let me tell you, its one of the best purchases I have ever made!  No more dragging hoses (except for set up-but I can do that in the daylight and turn the water on later), the ""tractor"" does all the dragging for me.  I water my entire front yard in one go--and since I live on a corner lot that means a turn is involved, the tractor handles the lazy curve no problem at all and pulls about 75' of hose with no sliding or digging. The auto shut off is an excellent feature too.  I love the variable speeds, I use ""slow"" and it takes about 3 hours to do 75 feet--a good, thorough soaking.  I also like the ability to twist the rotating sprinkler bars, I can control the height of the water spray ring with this.  The tractor is steel and I'm sure it will hold up well.  the wheels are plastic, but very solid with spikey grips on it that handle my rarely mowed grass with ease. Overall worth the price.  Do yourself a favor--stop dragging hoses and let this baby do it for you!  You won't be sorry...."
3.0,It's good quality for what it is.  And the same as the more expensive versions at your local store.  My only qualm is that it has a center of weight that is high.  This causes it to tip when on inclines.  So don't buy this if you plan on running it on the side of a hill.
5.0,"I wish I would have found this product years ago. I was debating whether to have a sprinkler system installed ($3000). But then I found this sprinkler and it does what needs to be done for a fraction of the price. Just lay your hose out in the pattern that you want to be watered and just watch that it does not jump off of the hose, pretty simple. You do still have to monitor it from time to time but it's a lot cheaper than installing a system."
5.0,"Look amazing, they are a gift so I will ask how the product does by the family receiving them.
Seem very well made!
Mrs. W"
5.0,Perfect for trimming your own flowers/plants for arrangements. I brought them to a floral arrangement class and even got a compliment by the teacher ;)
3.0,good
1.0,I purchased these because of the sale price.  I have an old pair of the same model Fiskars that is much better quality.  These are cheap looking and poor quality. The blade material is too soft. They seized up after only a few uses. I'm back to using the old pair.  The fact they would put this product on the market definitely changes my opinion of Fiskars.
5.0,These things are sturdy and chop things well. They've seen some light use in the past year and I haven't had to sharpen them yet.
5.0,Did the job.
5.0,Sharp - just what I needed for pruning a ficus tree.  Easy on the hands.
4.0,"Very good quality, very good price"
5.0,Excellent tool
5.0,Work very well
5.0,"GOT UP ON THE HOUSE AND SPRAYED THE TALL TREES AROUND THE HOUSE
WORKED LIKE A CHARM BETTER THAN PREVIOUS ONES"
5.0,I have used many types of sprayers but none holds a candle to this Gilmour sprayer. That's why I purchased a couple more of them.
5.0,this is a well put together tool it will suit my needs on my small farm.  price was right too.  Works very well worth the money if you wantto spray your yard and need to meter chemical.
4.0,This sprayer seems to work well for me.  I have used it to spray liquid fertliizer and bug killer on my garden.  I have also used it to help spray cleaner on my house windows.
4.0,"I have used this with spraying EM (effective microorganisms) on our garden, chicken coop and yard. The only problem I had at first is bits of wheat bran (from the EM concoction) were getting stuck in the brass inlet hole. The solution was to strain the EM before using it in the Gilmour.

I have also used it with a wettable powder, Agro-Winn mineral powder. I placed about 7 oz of the powder in the container and filled it with water nearly to the top. I then sprayed it at the maximum amount (10 tbs per gallon). Overall it did okay but did clog several times. Solutions I found where to continually gently shake the sprayer while in use, to keep the mineral powder in suspension and not settle to the bottom where it could clog the intake. Also occasionally releasing the spray handle would allow the intake tube to clear and then starting again it would start spraying again. Probably also next time I won't put as much powder in at once.

I have given the sprayer moderate use over about a year period and it seems like it will keep on working for a while. Worth the money so far."
5.0,I used it to clean my house with bleach. Did a great job. I put a ball valve on the end of the hose to quickly change from the sprayer to a nozzle.
3.0,"Haven't used it yet, but delivery was fast, and it is what I was expecting. Nice to know it is on the shelf....ready to go."
5.0,Sprayer works great.  Good control compared to the cheap plastic ones in local stores.  I highly recommend this sprayer for lawn and fruit trees.
1.0,"I only used it about 3 times and it no longer works (everything is staying in the bottle and not pumping up).  It has leaked ever since I first started using it.  I thought I could fix it, so I put two rubber washers in it (one where the bottle screws in and one where the hose attaches to it) hoping to stop it from leaking.  It worked that one time, but now needs a small rubber washer between the metal nozzle and where the plastic bottle screws in, but I don't have a small one.  I think this leaking is causing the bottle to not have enough pressure to be able to pull up liquid products.

The metal dial bent while I was changing the measured amounts at the top.  That dial was always really hard to turn.  I don't know if this affected anything, though.  Also, I thought it was going to be like a regular hose nozzle and not turn on until I squeezed the handle.  It was always on unless I turned the water off.  If I would have known this, I probably wouldn't have bought it.  It's been fun sitting it down to turn on the water, and then running to it as quickly as I can without getting wet...

Maybe I just wasn't using it correctly, and tightened it too much.  I have no idea.  Nothing looked stripped.  I've never used anything like this before, and maybe I missed something in the instructions.  I already threw the packaging away, and to me, it's not worth trying to exchange/return.  I'll probably just go buy something similar locally, or get a small rubber washer and see if it fixes it."
5.0,mixing and pumping tanks kept me from doing the weed control and fertilizing and fruit spraying.  now i can dump it in and spray away. just make sure you don't run herbicide through the same one you use to fertilize or spray fruit trips. I've bought several and plan on having one for each thing.  maybe hook up some quick disconnects for weed control one and leave it loaded for quick easy spray.
2.0,Plastic wheels and plastic gears; that's a sale killer in my book.
4.0,shipping was fast and product was as described.
5.0,"This is a sturdy, reliable item. I now own two and they are great at broad or small coverage. Highly recommend, especially since you can buy parts as needed, if needed."
2.0,"Slightly disappointed with the Raintrain.  Initially worked well but I have a large area to cover and only two spigots coming off my house.  When I used an extra hose to reach the furthest corner of my property (3 - 50' hoses), the Raintrain couldn't pull the weight of 1 -1/2 hoses (once it got far enough where a hose and half was 'behind' it) and make it all the way across the yard.  I've been forced to shorten the area in which I set up the stopper and then re-set the whole thing again.  Not really what I wanted.  I had hoped to set this up in the early evening and have it cover the whole back yard overnight."
5.0,"This item makes ""keeping the lawn green"" very easy.....rather effortless.  Fun to watch it travel along its' route."
5.0,"Parents had a Nelson traveling sprinkler years ago,a sibling is still using it.  We now have one and are thrilled with it.  Set it once and it is watering the whole yard!  Excellent quality, heavy cast, expect this to be passed down through our children as well !"
4.0,this is a great time saver but requires long hose runs.
2.0,"I've owned this sprinkler for 4 years now.  In theory, this is an awesome sprinkler.  In practice, it falls short.  While I didn't necessarily think this was going to be a 'set it and forget it' type of device, I also didn't expect an issue 75% of the time that I used it.
I like the heaviness of it, and I have not had the gear-stripping issues that other reviewers have.

Here are the issues:

One must be very exact in placement of the hose.  If you want to make a turn, you must have that turn constructed just so...or it will jump the hose and get stuck.

It throws water quite a distance, but I am not super-impressed with the amount of water it gives during the 'low' setting, which is supposed to soak.  I don't think 1/2"" of water on my lawn after nearly THREE HOURS of running is a 'soak'.  High gear gives even less.  The neutral setting doesn't seem to make sense, as this throws water in a circle pattern.  Only the outer edges of the circle actually get water.  So, if you have it in neutral, there will be a large radius surrounding the sprinkler that won't get water at all.

My biggest peeve of all with this sprinkler (and the reason I am no longer using it) is the horribly designed automatic shutoff button.  There is a button beneath the sprinkler that is supposed to push in when the sprinkler climbs the shutoff ramp and turn it off.  Our backyard has some areas of thicker water grass.  If the hose is over top of one of these clumps, the sprinkler will shut off.  I am not talking a big 2"" tall clump...I am talking maybe 1/2"" difference in grade.  Few things are more frustrating than setting this sprinkler and leaving it for an hour or so, only to find that it shut off 20 minutes into the path.
On the flip side, we've had it climb the ramp and NOT shut off as it should...thereby soaking the foundation wall of the house for a good 30 minutes.

We've ditched this sprinkler in favor of the old school metal 'fan' type.  Sure, we move it every 20-30 minutes, but we can water the entire yard with almost an inch of water in about an hour and a half, which is half the time and twice the water of this overpriced, inefficient sprinkler."
5.0,"This is the best lawn sprinkler I have ever owned. I don't need to worry about moving it to another location, it waters the entire lawn and then shuts off when it reaches the end. I Love It!"
5.0,"I purchased this product 5 yrs ago and had to reorder because it finally stop working.

I glad I had to order a new Raintrain because it's even better than before.

Thank you Nelson for making such a great product."
5.0,Love it!
5.0,"Big enough ,"
5.0,Cheap and works great for the price. Can drop on the driveway without breaking.
5.0,GREAT product for the money.
5.0,"Classic metal hose sprayer nozzle.  Good build, finish and operation.  Apply a little oil/grease to the piston occasionally to keep it working nicely.  Everything I'd expect from this age old design--glad they're still making it."
5.0,This is my second one.  The first one is over a year old and works great.  Much better than more expensive ones Ive used.  I use mine daily as long as its not frozen.
5.0,Arrived early and more than heavy duty enough for home use.
5.0,awesome
5.0,This guy outlasts the other versions sold in stores by years! Highly recommended!
5.0,good value
5.0,"I've tried all sorts of different ways to put down ""weed b gone"" but this is by far my favorite way.  After I bought this I remembered my dad having a great looking lawn when I was younger and I'm nearly positive that he used one of these.  The only thing I would change about this would be to see if it had a little more range on it.  I suppose that has more to do with my water pressure though.
Would definitely buy again.  My lawn already looks MUCH better."
5.0,"Got it to wash my horse with.  Does an excellent job mixing the shampo,making suds.  Spray is not too forcefull."
5.0,"After what feels like using every hose end sprayer on the market and deciding they are all trash. I took and chance on this Gilmour 362 Pro and LOVE it! I used a 36% permethrin insecticide diluted down sprayed the entire outside of the house and yard. In the past I have been nearly carried off by sand gnats and mosquitoes. Not anymore, it was total annihilation and I win. No more crickets, gnats, beetles, centipedes, roaches, spiders. Permethrin is also a commonly used termitacide so I try to spray under planters, stones, and things sitting around in the yard where if you turn it over you will find termites on the surface. I had ants trailing along under my paver walks... not anymore.

Take the fan sprayer off, add permethrin, shoot wood lines, leaf beds, where ticks and other nasties hang out waiting to make you life hell. (NOTE: PUT THE LITTLE BLACK DEVICE SOMEPLACE SAFE, I LOST MINE ALREADY ON DAY ONE). I plan on buying another for herbicide(I have a lot of wooded property I need to start clearing).

If you are looking for a hose end sprayer or just a better way to dispense lawn chem I highly recommend this sprayer."
5.0,"I needed to spray a 25 ft. maple tree with a fungicide.  I used the direct tip and could reach almost to the top with my home water pressure, which isn't too great anyway.  The numbered dial on the top is easily to adjust for the amount of material to be mixed with the water.  It is also a firm click type setting which won't change while using the sprayer.  I have used it on other shrubs in our yard with the fan tip to get a broader spray.

It would work fine with soluble fertilizers.  I don't plan to use it with herbicides just to be safe though I'm sure that if one cleans the entire sprayer, including the bottle,  thoroughly it could be used for that purpose too.

This is a heavy duty product that I think will last a long time.  Just remember to clean it completely after use."
5.0,"This product couldn't be easier to use.  The instructions are easy to understand.  It is a high quality unit with a lifetime replacement policy, which I do not forsee having to use.  It allows you to adjust the spray pattern to a fan pattern for covering larger areas, such as your yard and then a stream pattern which is good for direct application or higher, hard to reach areas, such as spraying fruit trees.  i have a sizable amount of grass which I use this to spray broadleaf killer over and with the fan spray pattern, it makes it quick(er) and easy."
5.0,"I love this thing, it makes it so easy to apply concentrated weed killer and insecticides!!  Great product, I highly recommend."
5.0,"I would recommend this sprayer to anyone looking for a well made sprayer!  Very good quality, heavy duty and very simple to use.  Purchased online from Supreme Hardware.  Fair price.  Came well packed and shipped quickly.  I would buy from this retailer again.  You won't disappointed."
5.0,"Bought this one, not only because it was priced reasonably, but also because it was
very well reviewed. There is a reason for this, it works.
Keep in mind it is for liquids only. I tried to take some dry fertilizer and soak it in a coffee can
so I could spray in the back yard. (I have chickens now and didn't want them eating it).
Save your time and do not do this. It will plug up the screen pickup.
The only other thing I noticed, is that I had to open up the metering valve to get a good flow."
4.0,"Even though the Gilmore sprayer did not reach the top of the tree's, as expected, it did do the job it was intended todo. I like the fact that you can fill the jar with concentrate, and then, dial in the tablespoon amount or convert it to the teaspoon amount, a nice feature. I would recomend this product for the right job."
4.0,"I'd give this thing 5 stars if Gilmour would sell me additional screw on containers.  They recommend not re-using the container if I use certain chemicals... but they don't sell additional containers.  Otherwise this thing is fantastic, a huge back saver."
5.0,"We do not have a sprinkler system, but strive to keep a nice green lawn during the hot months of summer.  This really does the trick.  We can do our entire yard in a matter of hours letting it travel on the hose.  You can adjust the arms to spray a wider or smaller pattern.  Make sure you use wide turns to prevent it from getting hung up.  Very happy with this purchase."
2.0,Do not Buy if you have ANY slope to you're yard. It will easily fall over.
3.0,can't get it to move. good coverage when using it in one place
3.0,"Would not buy another one, would be great in a straight area."
5.0,"Very good as a traveling sprinkler.  You just need to keep and eye on it as some times it jumps the hose and goes on little side trips.
Works very good."
5.0,"iI have had this for more than a month and it has saved my lawn.  Can't afford a sprinkler system this year, so this is the next best thing."
5.0,Super  sprinkler.
5.0,"Nelson is a heavy duty metal traveler, not the plastic that most of the market puts out. This is the second season of work and it does the job that it was designed to do"
4.0,Good!
5.0,LOVE IT. Just as ad said.
5.0,"I got these shears for my mom because I have a pair of Fiskars shears of my own, and they've been very reliable.  These shears are very comfortable to use and easy to lock and unlock with the orange slider in the middle.  The blade is sharp, and the shears have been effective for clipping small branches, blackberry brambles and vines, as well as pruning rose bushes.  Highly recommended for an easy-to-use, long-lasting pair of shears."
5.0,I like all the Frisker products as they fit comfortable in the hand and are good quality.
5.0,very good
5.0,These work great! They cut just about anything! Much better than scissors. I can't believe I waited so long to buy these!
5.0,Sturdy and powerful.  I was able to work through just about anything that would fit into the jaws with this one.  Works well for left and right handed users.
5.0,"I bought these to replace a pair I bought in 2014. I read the packaging on the new pair and saw a lifetime warranty. I called the company to see if I could return the old pair to be fixed. A very fine, friendly fellow offered to mail me a new pair as a replacement. It was a pleasure dealing with Fiskers. I will continue to buy their products."
4.0,The shears work well however I have only had them a short time and they already need sharpening.  That is why I gave them a 4.
5.0,I lost mine so had to replace them and I chose these.  A very good choice!  They work better than any I have purchased before.  Nice and sharp.
5.0,Work fine.
5.0,"Really nice pruning shears. I've used Fiskar shears for many years and always been pleased with the quality. I needed a replacement set and bought these, expecting them to have the same excellent quality but also the same sometimes-difficult blade lock that my older Fiskars have. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this new pair has a very simple slide-up-and-lock feature to lock the blades. This requires a simple push with the thumb instead of the old balky and difficult to use locking mechanism that had to be forced into place. Nice improvement, Fiskars!"
5.0,Good quality old school sprayer! Just like you remember from the old days.
5.0,"Recommended by Wirecutter as a good budge nozzle, and I agree with them. Works perfectly and if they corrode, I can easily afford to buy more. I've tried expensive ones and they still corrode or worse, get stolen."
5.0,"Old school rules!  Forget the new school, fancy garbage that breaks quickly.  Tried and true, works and lasts."
5.0,"Yep, it's  a metal hose sprayer"
4.0,"Very solidly built. My ""fancier"" nozzles have fallen apart due to having many moving plastic parts. I expect this will last longer. You regulate the spray by squeezing harder to make it a stream, or squeezing less to make a soft spray. One downside is you can't do a soft spray in a small area, such as a single pot. If you are doing a soft spray it will be very wide."
5.0,"Top accesory for my boats hose, strong and great material"
5.0,Yaah! Durable metal [forget the junky plastic ones]. It puts out a good stream of water.
4.0,"Like the hose, however, I wish there was some kind of rubber on the handle to prevent slipping with wet hands."
2.0,sprayer has rusted in less than a year and leaks.....
5.0,This thing is amazing. I know it's a weird thing to say about a hose nozzle but this thing is well built and powerful.
4.0,A lot of our land is on a hillside so that is not good for Mr. Raintrain!  But on level ground it is great!
5.0,Fantastic
5.0,"This traveling sprinkler was better than I expected. I expected it to be light and cheap, but it is heavy. The wheels are plastic but a tough plastic. I have a rough yard, and though it gets stuck in the mud from time to time. It is expected with my yard not being fully grassed. In the grass spots it does amazing, and we have a lot of wind hear, and the setting for when it's windy works amazing. I love this sprinkler and I am looking at buying another."
4.0,I could sit and stare at this all day.
5.0,"Pretty cool, always wanted one of these and almost bought it here. But at Walmart yesterday and it was $39."
3.0,"I bought one of these 5 years ago and it's still going strong.  Guy at the Ace says he's had customers use one for 20+ years before it needed repair!  I bought a second one about a month ago so I could water new sod in two places at once.  Well, the new one's gears are stripping after only 2 weeks of use.  The old one will dig itself a trench if it runs into obstacles, and can pull 40' of hose uphill.  The new one now gives up easily and just ""clicks"" trying to go up a low slope or pulling 20' of hose on level ground.  It will roll a few inches then... ""click"" and roll back an inch or so as if the gears slipped.  I expect more from a $75 product.  Not sure whether to bother dealing with the warranty, says it could take 6 weeks round-trip meanwhile my sod still needs to be watered at least a couple times per week."
5.0,Hood Stuff
5.0,"Great watering tool.  Treat it gently and it will last a long time.  You have to understand the plastic gears are fragile.

I knew that coming in and I've treated it carefully, and it has worked flawlessly."
3.0,"The concept for this product is pretty good. The product is very durable however, we have 3 acres of Bermuda grass to water (up until recently we had an irrigation water available, it's no longer available to us). We tried it out for 1/2 a day and the Raintrain traveled about 30 feet in 3 hours..  At the rate the sprinkler moves, it would take us a month of constant watering to finish.  The other issue is the sprinkler arms only stream water, there is no spray or a way to adjust the way the water is dispensed.  We get more water out of a rainbird. We've decided to devise our own portable sprinkler system with PVC pipe and sprinkler heads!"
5.0,This gadget goes back to the 70's but it's very efficient. I love it.
5.0,Bought these because we were doing our own flowers for our wedding. These pruners handled over 800 stems right out of the package...can't go wrong with Fiskars!
5.0,great
5.0,works as stated
5.0,Great quality and easy to use
5.0,"Cant beat price at less $15,comfortable and holding up well so far"
5.0,I use these to cut my dog's catfish jerky which is very hard.  They work well - very sharp and easy to hold soft handles.  The blade is short but for what I use it for it works.
5.0,Great product
3.0,"nice and sharp, comfortable, blades hold up well. Foam handles slip off of mine after about 2 summers of light/moderate use."
5.0,Gets the job done.
5.0,Very nice and easy to handle.
3.0,There is lead in the brass part of this product. You should wear gloves when using this and wash your hands afterwards.
3.0,"My sprayer wouldn't work at all.  I called Gilmour thinking maybe it was me.  They were very nice and ran through checking it out, and then said they'd send me a repair kit.  While waiting I looked at sprayers in the stores and decided this Gilmour  seemed to be of higher quality than anything I saw.  The repair kit came.  I failed to fix it.  No instructions.  I gave up.  Amazon kindly took it back.  Now I don't want one at all.  The others seem to not measure up, but Gilmour let me down.  If you have a handy man around the house I'd recommend this one."
4.0,"I don't know why I didn't get one of these a long time ago.  I have been buying the pump sprayers for years and they just don't last.  If you don't clean them out, you get one use out of them.  If you do clean them out, you still only get a handful of uses (at least in my experience).  This little unit is  made better (brass instead of all plastic junk) and is super easy to clean by just flushing clean water through it for a few minutes after you have exhausted the concentrate inside.  It's nice, it's clean, I recommend it."
5.0,"I've used it a couple times and I'm impressed. The little red knob (mentioned by others) looks a bit fragile - probably should be a brass nut. The diverter works well, but would be nice to have other nozzle attachments for different spray patterns. Take the diverter off and it'll spray 30 ft easy.

I got it mainly to dormant-spray my peach trees. In the meantime, I'm using it to fertilize my yard and garden with Miracle Gro. I've been using the Miracle Gro sprayer, which lets you spray for 15-20 minutes on one bag of fertilizer. But I've never completely trusted the way it mixes water and fertilizer. The other problem with it is what to do with the leftover. Depending on when you stopped spraying, there's no way to tell the strength of the mixture left in the bottle.

The Gilmour instructions for pre-mixing are easy to follow and work like a charm. For Miracle Gro, mix one tablespoon in 5 oz of water, pour it into the sprayer bottle, set it to 10 and you're ready to go. For longer spray time, mix 3 tablespoons in 15 oz of water to just about fill the sprayer bottle. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure you can double (or more?) the strength of your pre-mix and lower the sprayer setting accordingly. For example, mix 6 tablespoons of Miracle Gro with 15 oz of water and set the sprayer to 5 - just make sure it's well dissolved before putting it in the sprayer."
4.0,"This is a very good product.  The concept is great.

I would like a short boom following the brass nozzle for spraying into taller trees.  I would also like a longer flexible tube at the bottom of the spray can so all of the fluid at the bottom of the container is sucked into the nozzle when the sprayer is tilted.  This is why the 4 star and not a 5 star.

One caution. You may need a higher concentration chemical spray mix to get the right amount on what is being sprayed."
5.0,I bought this at the suggestion of my neighbor who works in the fertilizer business.  HE said that it was far more precise and useable than the ones readily available in regular garden stores.  HE was right.  It mixes well and at levels that are more in keeping with the needs I have.  The fact that the nozzle has a movable shield really helps to keep the bricks around my beds free from things such as iron stains. I would highly recommend this item.
4.0,"PRO's:

*NO LEAKS!!  Not a drop!

*Numbers easily readable on dial

*Dial indicator nub on side nice addition

*Metal hose nozzle way better than cheap plastic

*Diffuser gives perfect spray pattern, arc, and distance when pointed up

*Well-anchored fine mesh filter on end of siphon tube

*Hose nozzle swivels on rest of unit to ward off likelihood of breakage

*Brass parts lend quality

*Bottle cap is nicely knurled, secure(!), turns independently of
 brass parts above it, and is comfortable on fingers

*Design allows for fairly easy calibration of time/amount ratio with a little
 trial-and-error (""I want to disperse such-and-such an amount in 15 minutes,"" e.g.)

*Unit not too heavy in hand, and has nice balance

CON's:

*Knurled rim on indicator dial is saw-like and uncomfortable.  It hurt my
 fingers and I cried

*Siphon tube too loose a fit

*Diffuser begs to be broken - should be made of metal

*Red stop knob on hose nozzle won't win any confidence awards for lastability

COMMENTS:

I could kick myself for not getting this sprayer long ago.  I spent way too much
time cussing the leaky cheap plastic green unit with its crummy fittings.

TIPS:

This is a high-end piece of sophisticated scientific dispersion equipment -
please treat it as such.  It must be kept surgically clean to function properly.
It has tiny orifices, and if they get gunked up, the unit will bog down.

Do yourself a favor and practice with plain water first.  Get to know your unit - it
is your friend.

Torque the little brass siphon tube plug (stored on the top of the unit when not
in use) down snugly so as not to lose it"
5.0,"Quality little sprayer, use it for pesticides and fertilizer for the lawn. Seems as though it should hold up very well over time."
4.0,"So this review could be premature but oh well.  Unit worked fine, make sure to read the instructions.  The nozzle provides for a wide spread of whatever concoction you are putting down."
2.0,"Out of the box I thought this is a toy.  The bottle capacity is 16 ounces (a can of Coke is 12 ounces).  Most sprayers are 36 ounces. It's less than 1/2 the size of Hudson, etc hose end sprayers.

On the bottle there is a warning: ""This product contains lead...""  However, the chemicals I spray on my lawn are no safer than lead.

Made in China. What isnt?  Perhaps that's how Gilmour can get away with the lead content."
5.0,This actually travels and save many trips outside to move the sprinkler.
2.0,It requires at least 50psi to operate. My well puts out 40psi max. So it does not work.
5.0,Very good product. Works as described
5.0,Love the flexibility of adjusting for yard size and not having to drag hoses around the yard for other systems.
5.0,"Best $75 I ever spent.  I have very low water pressure and wasn't sure this would work, but it does, and saves me many hours of moving and rearranging water hoses."
5.0,"Ohhhh, Yap, that one a great one too. thanks"
5.0,I love these sprinklers...this is our second and will continue to buy for watering large yard!
3.0,"I owned the competitor Orbit green tractor until the gears broke.  Thought I would try this fancy yellow brand.  I read reviews that indicating this one would stay on the hose track.  My experience is this tractor jumps the hose track at the slightest curve.  Maybe the nose isn't as heavy as the Orbit green tractor, which had no problems staying on the track."
5.0,I have one that is 35 years old that still functions as new.  Run them at the same time and both fulfill my needs in a perfect fashion.  A great product!
5.0,Works like a charm and so nice since we have a big yard with no sprinkler system. We love it.
5.0,Squirts real good.
5.0,Exelent
5.0,Just as discribed!!!!!
4.0,"Decent hose head for cheap. The stream doesn't quite get as concentrated as I would like, but great for the price."
5.0,Works great!  Sprays different patterns based on squeeze pressure used. There is a knob that can adjusted to set the handle distance and change the spray pattern when fully pressed.  I prefer the maximum power and focused jet.  The output pressure of this nozzle is stronger than the last 3 hose nozzles I purchased at Lowe's or Home Depot.
5.0,"Just your basic old fashioned well made, reliable, works fine-lasts a long time nozzle.  Doesn't do tricks or amuse you with fancy ways to squirt water, but will be squirting long after the fancy ones have gone south."
5.0,It looks indestructible and performs better than the shower-head style I have used in the past.
3.0,"Really love it, but the rubber ring tends to fall off if you unscrew."
2.0,I bought two and both have issues with the hand lever getting stuck in a spray position.  Frequently need to manually pull back the lever to stop the water flow.
1.0,These are made in China now and start to rust after a year's use outside.
4.0,handy
5.0,Worked as advertises -- great solid feel and easy to use.  Have put though a tough summer pruning bushes and small branches with no issues.
4.0,It's a Fiskars so it's gotta be pretty good.
5.0,Excellent shears. Highly recommend them.
5.0,"Great quality, just what I was looking for"
3.0,"I loved how smooth of a cut these gave and also how easy they were to grip. Unfortunately, after using for about a month and accidentally leaving them out in the rain one night they were rusted. I've never seen something rust so quickly.  Not really sure what happened. As long as you make sure they are put away they are good."
4.0,I like it!  It handles well and has a very smooth action.  Does the job!
4.0,Good
5.0,"Friskars always makes good tools, and this is no exception.  Thanks!"
4.0,Lock is flimsy and difficult to engage/disengage
3.0,"The sprayer on this product puts out a somewhat misty stream of water which makes it perfect for applying herbicides or pesticides to foliage.  However, if you want to apply fertilizer to soil around your plants, it takes a really long time to get the full amount of fertilizer onto your soil because the water delivery happens so slowly."
5.0,"when I first tried to use it,it would not siphon any liquid from the bottle(I was trying to spray liquid Bifen)indicating that it was not spraying anything except water. The next day I ran water only in the bottle figuring that if it would empty the water than it must be working. I then filled the bottle with 2 oz. of Bifen and began spraying, this time it worked even when I filled the bottle with 10 oz. it kept working. I think I'll keep it since it does spray nice, the only hassle I would say is that the plastic spray diverter is a little hard to remove (probable made that way so it will not fly off too easy during use!)"
5.0,"FINALLY!!!! A hose end sprayer that works and works well. Did lots of looking before finding this Gilmour in Amazon. I'm a machinist/ millwright and was interested because of the metal components. Read some reviews and ordered it, used it the first time today and it worked great. The nozzle directs spray where you want it to go and the metering apparatus it accurate. It's easy to mount and remove the container and the unit is easy to clean and back-flush. Just can't say enough good about it. The amount of flow and reach is just what I will need for my fruit trees as well. Well worth the price."
5.0,"I originally had a chameleon sprayer which did not work well at all.  I purchased the spectracide brand weed killer and filled up this Gilmour 362, set the dial to 2 tablespoons, and went to town.  All my weeds in the yard are now gone in two weeks.  The design is great, cleanup is easy, and this will last a very long time.  I am very happy with this purchase and thank everyone for their reviews of this product."
5.0,"I have had several different types of these over the past few years.  This one is the most heavy duty out of all of them.  It works much better than the others as well.  The others are bad about having leaks everywhere, which causes you to get wet.  This one does not have that problem."
1.0,"the red button pictured in the product illustration pulled off on my first attempt to use the sprayer. this button is necessary for the trigger to function.  unfortunately, the product passed its return period before i attempted to use it.  it appears to be a defect in assembly.  i cannot comment on how the product actually works since i can't use it and i can't return it for refund or replacement.  your mileage may vary."
5.0,this is prob the easiest thing to use! we got it to go with our mosquito barrier. Love the fact that you can adjust the direction of the spray as well as the simple cleaning! so glad we settled on this sprayer!
5.0,Easy to use. Does spray up to 30 feet as described. This has allowed me to spray trees and bushes.
4.0,"This is the 2nd one of these I have purchased.  The last one was 20 years ago.  Clean out the device after every use and it should last you many years.  The new ones have a backflow device in the base of the spray handle which sprayed all over me when I wasn't spraying the pesticide.  I got a good soaking from my arms downwards.  Is this a design flaw, mfg. error or ?"
5.0,Good solid product.  Easy to adjust.  I used it to spread 2 4-d in the yard with excellent results.  Great deal
5.0,this is a replacement and Nelson still builds their products to last.  Works well.
1.0,"If  arms are set low for a small area, it won't track on the hose.  If arms set for a wide area, the arms fly off.  If set for maximum area, it jumps itself off the hose.  Too bad the one we used for 35 years finally gave out - it was reliable and easy to set up.

Revising this 2 star review to 1-star.  I have struggled with this sorry, heavy thing for over a year, thinking I will get the hang of it.  I give up.  We've spent more time adjusting, readjusting, and readjusting some more than we've spent watering.  There is something basically wrong with it.  I called the mfg. to ask what I was doing wrong & rep said something about the motor probably being damaged, that it happens a lot.  Too bad we had a rainy spell right after receiving it, so it was too late to send it back.  Buy it if you must, you may get a good one, but my advice is NO."
5.0,Great sprinkler. Auto off function works well.
1.0,"gears are already broken, it won't move forward"
5.0,Performed exactly as advertised and it is built to last.  Use it daily to water my new 1 1/2 acre lawn.
4.0,Does the job.
4.0,"It has two gears, fast and slow. I was using it in the fast speed and it somehow got stuck. Now it acts like the gear is stripped and does not move in the fast speed. It still works in the slow speed and I like it very much."
5.0,"I've had these sprinklers in the past, and this one works perfectly.  We'll see about long term reliability."
5.0,This is my second one. The first one lasted about 20 years. The only thing that wore out is the connection to the water hose. My yard is fairly large and the sprinkler has to make several turns. I think that's the reason the water connector broke
4.0,"Had ours for 15+ years and still going strong. This sprinkler is particularly useful with odd shaped lots. The arms are adjustable for different diameter broadcasts. The cast iron body makes it very stable and provides very good traction. Have not had the chance to test it to the 200' max length but can certainly handle 100' length with no problem. Reason for 4 stars is the front wheel doesn't look wide enough to pass over [commercial-grade] hose couplings made from heavy duty thick brass - I believe the width of some brass couplings will cause the sprinkler to derail in some circumstances. Otherwise, it's a VERY solid, reliable product. Recommended."
5.0,"Love it, but it's metal so it gets real hot in the sun. Make sure to keep that in mind when you store it somewhere."
1.0,"After 6 months of use, started rusting."
5.0,This thing is built like a tank. So far no issues at all. It has plenty pressure for tough cleaning jobs. Everything is metal with no plastic bits at all. No rusting at all and I've had it awhile now. This is definitely the best hose nozzle I have ever found.
5.0,Works great and very convenient to use with my drain king.
5.0,"Bought two of these after reading about them on Sweethome.  They feel solidly built and are cheap.  Spray is nice and continuously adjustable but nothing fancy.  Zero leaks, unlike my previous multi-pattern plastic sprayer.  Seems like they will last a while but even if they fail in a year the price is right.  For those who are health conscious these are made in China and I'm fairly certain they will leech lead into the water if you don't properly drain your hose, but even then you probably shouldn't be drinking hose water."
5.0,Great nozzle. I bought specifically for the threaded end. Works perfect.
3.0,"I bought this because it looked like the old school nozzles I remember my parents and grandparents using. Those things would last forever. Although this one still functions fine, the finish has began to chip off and is rusting after about a year."
4.0,I haven't used it much but it seems to be good quality.
5.0,"Gimme some of that old time metal stuff.  Unfortunately this is made in China so I won't buy any more, but the quality is top notch."
5.0,"After replacing all the fancy hose nozzles twice per year, I found an old metal bare bones nozzle like this one lying around and used it.  I had forgotten how well this old simple style worked and how reliable it was, so I bought several of these for all of my hoses.  I will never go back to the crappy multi spray pattern ones that just don't last!!"
4.0,"Great quality, seems to apply pre emergent and herbicide quick and easy. Just make sure there is no wind, great product"
5.0,I have used other sprayers this one is tops. I actually bought 2 one for fertilizer the other for pesticides
5.0,Bought this to use for spray permethrin around the yard and house. Works well and the ratios are easy to adjust. Like that I can change the metering guage from tbs to tsp. My only concern is the longevity of the spray head that forces the water to fan out. Would have been much more confident if it was metal.
5.0,great product works as advertised!! tried many other sprayers over the years this one works really well. i love it
3.0,"Based on the other reviews, I hoped I would be able to use this unit to wash my house.  Although it reaches the very top floor, it does not have enough power to remove the mildew.  I've been reading and that may be related to my water pressure.  I can use it for  a good rinse or applying detergent but it does not have enough power to remove the soften stains once the detergent has dissolved the grim.  I may use it later this year to spray my fruit trees.  It looks like it will handle that job much better."
1.0,"I was really looking forward to receiving this item but it arrived in New Zealand with an essential part missing from the package.  if you could find it and send it to me I'm sure I would change my rating.  The part # is 48677 and consists of an Anti-Siphon Unit which includes an anti-siphon barrel, anti-siphon Disc and Rubber Diaphram.  I am assuming that's the reason for the water spitting back at the operator rather than shooting through the sprayer."
4.0,I found the sprayer easy to set up and use.  Only issues are that the sprayer is calibrated for tablespoons per gal. and the ingredient is dosed as ounces per gal.  Also the deflector makes it awkward unless there is a large quantity in the reservoir.
4.0,"Gilmore now seems to be owned by Robert Bosch, perhaps Bosch can bring some German quality back into this very good product.

 Over all I've had this spray for years and it works well as advertised, however the chrome plating over time begins to peel and get nasty. Corrosion can be a problem, be sure and clean it well."
4.0,"This was my first time using an end-hose sprayer as a home owner. I was really impressed with the simple design of this item. The metal screw located on the top can be inserted into the pipe that feeds your solution into the sprayer. This action changes the amount diffused into your spray from tablespoons to teaspoons. The instructions also include helpful conversions for ounces. My only concern with the item comes when you must (at some point) set it down. On its side, I had a problem with my concentrate leaking slightly from the top. When working on a large yard, they'll be some point you must set this down so having a sprayer that could rest on a flat surface, or withstand being tipped to the side, would be helpful. All and all, it's a good value for the money."
1.0,"Continues to draw product even when NOT depressing handle.  Unfortunately I was unable to use it when I purchased it (in the winter) until more recently.  Therefore my return window has ended.

A complete disappointment.

It also contains lead which is weird and concerning."
5.0,Exactly what I expected. No exposed springs or coils that typically get lost.
4.0,Worked as expected
4.0,Great pruners m very sharp and nice silicon handles . Good quailty
5.0,"sturdy, does the job every time."
5.0,"Well made solid cutter typical of Fiskar brand. Though not a replaceable blade, its tough blade lasts and lasts through hundreds of cuts. The price is right for its awesome longevity!!!!"
4.0,Easy to use and easy to sharpen
5.0,This pruning shears worked well and was able to cut branches almost 1/2 inch in diameter
5.0,Better then my 20 year old favorites. Precise and easy on the hands.
5.0,Just as expected. Very nice!
1.0,"Bought first pair and they did not cut well at all.  Sticky. So I called and Fiskar sent me another pair, same thing.  I will never buy another Fiskar product again.  Not impressed."
5.0,"Love it!
Just be careful with the plastic on the arms; wants to leak but don't over torque or it seems like it will break."
5.0,"This item works well & worth the money. It is solid & heavy. It is slow enough that I felt the areas got watered enough without repeating the path. I like that it stops when it gets to it's destination. You barely see it moving, it goes so slow, so it takes awhile before it is done."
5.0,"It works wonderful, I'm fixing to purchase our 2nd because the hubby likes it so much. It does shut off when it reaches its ramp, I was a little weary whether it would but we have been pleased."
4.0,"This sprinkler is really intended for established lawns which require deep watering. Product moves slowly and saturates the soil as designed; this type of watering is ideal to help foster deep root growth.

If you have a newly seeded lawn, this is not for you.  The hose, which the traveling sprinkler drags behind it, will gather all of the straw you may be using to protect and help moisturize your seed leading to bare patches in your lawn once it's established. Additionally - this sort of deep watering on a non-ground covered surface will result in water runoff, and this runoff will take your seed with it! So be careful!"
5.0,"I have a irregular shaped yard with a large tree right in the middle and no in ground sprinkler system. Originally I bought some of those sprinklers you can daisy chain together but the pressure was so low by the time it got to the 3rd one it wasn't very effective. Plus the short hoses used to connect them nearly disintegrated after their first summer in the sun. The next year I bought one of those big sprinklers that sprays water way up in the air while sweeping back and forth, but because of the tree I had to move it to properly water the whole lawn which was a PITA. Then I saw this raintrain at wally world (for half this price by the way) so I decided to give it a go. I just lay my hose out in a little circle around the tree, set the train on it and turn it on. It properly soaks my entire lawn way better then any sprinkler I've had so far. I've only had it for a few weeks but my lawn already looks greener then it has in a long time and I even have new grass growing in some of the little dead spots. And my lawn is bumpy and slightly sloped and it still works great so don't let the warnings about needing perfect flat lawns scare you off. As long as the gears hold up it'll be worth every penny."
4.0,"There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a ""traveling"" sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.

Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.

Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it."
1.0,Not very happy.  It went off the track and ran into a tree which caused the gears to strip.  The gears are cheap plastic.  I would think you would get a better product for the price.
5.0,The best item I have ever bought on Amazon. This sprinkler is by far the best and cheapest way of watering the lawn for some lazy person like myself. Once setup it does the rest and you don't have to worry about it.
5.0,"Works great!  Has an automatic shutoff so that if it gets bogged down in the mud (mine has twice now), it will stop spraying water until you come rescue it.  Adjustable spray diameter, adjustable speed.  Great product."
2.0,"What do you expect with Cheap plastic gears. I only got 2 summers of use out of my tractor and now it's broke.
-The yellow stopper thing is also poorly designed. If you don't have the hose perfectly straight and on flat ground the front wheel will slide right off and not stop the tractor. If they only made the sides taller it would work perfectly. I'm dissapointed and will not bother buying another."
5.0,Very sturdy and well made.  Very strong spray.  Easy to hold the handle down.
5.0,best one for hosing down driveways
5.0,Hook it to garden hose. Turn on. It sprays water out.
5.0,Works great and made well.
5.0,"Very simple, easy to use sprayer."
4.0,don't leave in rain to rust? works great!!
5.0,"Has been the only nozzle (in a long, long time) to last for one complete season! Yay! Next year will be telling.
We gave up on the fancy nozzles with different spray patterns etc. They kept breaking or leaking in no time.
Of course you can adjust it to mist, jet, or flood - just by the amount of pressure you use on the handle.
Old school, but it works and it has lasted!!!"
1.0,I have really strong water pressure and this thing leaks like a sieve.
5.0,A simple hose nozzle that's all metal that hopefully lasts a long time.  My dad had one of these that he left outside all year long and it lasted over a decade.  I went through 3 of the adjustable plastic nozzles with the dozen spray settings and none of them have lasted over a year.  Let's hope this simple one puts them to shame.
5.0,"Perfect from gardening to washing vehicles. These original nozzles are far superior to all those other fat, alien looking nozzles with different settings. They are plasiticky and always break/fail. Buy one of these and be happy."
5.0,Just buy this and use it.  You will not have any conditions where if fails. This is a great sprayer.
3.0,"The sprayer appears very well made! I like the fact that you do not mix chemicals with water in the reservoir. The problem I had was my water pressure is so low that no chemicals will mix and if I up my pressure I am concerned I will burst the plastic supply pipes my townhouse has! When/if I ever get to use with appropriate water pressure, I will revisit my rating. PS.The booklet with the item does specify the necessary pressure range, not manufacturer's fault."
1.0,"was good not as everybody were satisfied. Sturdy product, but mine got broken in 3 month. The red spon popped off and I tried to fix it but not easy, so couldnt."
5.0,"This product is built well and works well.  I didn't have any problems with this sprayer.  Previous feedback stated problems with spraying at different angles, but I did not experience this problem."
5.0,Just the right item to use with Florel. Easy to adjust and provides a very high stream to hit the tops of the fruit trees.
1.0,If you are planning to spray any concentrated insecticide (most of them form emulsions with water) this sprayer will not work in the 1-2 tsp setting the liquid doest not suction well.
5.0,Seems very well built. Very easy to use. Just fill it. Put the dial on correct setting and spray. Then clean it well.
2.0,"It does a basic job.  The teaspoon conversion adapter is okay, but there should be some kind of marking on the dial to tell you what the what the default measuring units are (tablespoon or teaspoon).  This can be important if you need to reacquaint yourself after a season without use or if you let your family member borrow it.  Also the arrow could standout more, so the user can rest assure its on the right setting.  Maybe it should have been painted ""black.""

The above is just improvements that could have been done.  If you compare other sprayers, the dials are much bigger and easy to read and have no need to use an ""adapter"" for teaspoon conversions.

My biggest gripe, is the little red snap cap (on top of the squeeze handle) fell off.  Its just a pressed on piece of plastic and its a pain to put back on.  It broke off only after 4 uses.  They should have used a metal nut or something more durable.  Now I am not sure I can depend on it staying on for my next spray."
5.0,"I have an older version of the Gilmoure No Pre-Mix Sprayer, which I have used for many years. I took it apart to clean it and misplaced a part. So I bought this Gilmour 362. It is slightly easier to use than the old one because of the dial-a-mix features. I found the misplaced part to the old sprayer, which gave it to my son. He said he would rather that I had given him the new one. But he accepted the gift because all he had was a pre-mix sprayer that required several stop and mixes to get the job done."
5.0,"Ordered this for my brother and said he loved it. He had read good reviews on the products and requested this specific model. After I asked him what he had thought of the product, he said it was great and really met his expectations. The quality of the product seemed better than the rest we had seen at the local stores."
5.0,These pruning shears are the perfect size for my hand. I can get so much done in a short amount of time. They don't spring far open so I don't have to pull them back together with my hand fully extended. This is my second pair of these. The first pair I just wore out and used them for 5 years! I would recommend to anyone! I love them!!!!
5.0,Nice little shears.  Comfortable in the hand
5.0,Very easy to prune most anything in the yard and garden. Will be easy to sharpen.
1.0,"These are horrible.  They are so tight that I have to pry them open every time I make just one cut with them.  Very frustrating and time consuming with these pruning shears.  I tried loosening the shears, but then they wouldn't cut at all."
2.0,Worked for about 4 small cuts then broke and pieces went flying. Poorly constructed. Invest in a better set.
5.0,Cut nicely
5.0,Excellent cuts thick branches well
5.0,"Only used it a couple times, but cuts easily and is very comfortable"
4.0,product was as expected
5.0,As expected
4.0,"Every time I use this item, I find myself staring at it. the kids have fun playing in the streams too.

This thing is heavy cast metal, and I consider that the only negative.

So, the way it works is that water escaping from the arm tips propel the arms around, and that drives a gearbox and wheels which propel it forward. The back wheels are like old time tractor wheels with small spikes in them  This is very effective in preventing slipping, The front wheel is cup shaped to fit on a water hose, which acts as a guide. So, you can water from one end of the yard to the other, as well as oddly shaped areas.  This will follow the hose however you place it.  So you can make it weave back and forth or even water in an ever widening spiral.  Just be sure that you do not have it drag too much hose as it goes.  The guide says 100 feet, and I believe it.  After it runs for an hour, I drag the hose closer to it so it does not have to pull so hard to move it.

There are two speeds you can choose, as well as a ""neutral"" if you want to water in a fixed spot.

The width of spray is easily adjustable by twisting them up higher or lower.  You can make a very narrow or very wide band.  You can adjust it very precisely, if you do not mind getting your shins wet.  I turn it on, then walk up to the sprinkler.  I then stop the arm in mid rotation, pivot the water arm up up for more width, down for less, then let it rotate 180 and do the other arm.  This is by far the most effective way to adjust it.  Another reviewer mentioned how hard it was to adjust,  then mentioned shutting it off, adjusting the arms, then turning it on.  You will spend all day getting it right with that method.

It even shuts itself off.  You have a stopper that you attach to the hose.  Once it bumps against the stopper, it shuts itself off.."
4.0,When set up as directed It worked as advertised. The weakly constructed hose connection is the reason for the 4 stars.
5.0,"I had concerns when I bought this. So far all of my concerns have been answered.
Concerns:
-it does not sprinkle by the tractor! True. However, as it moves the leading and trailing edges of the water gets to the area so all of the grass is being watered the same amount. It is probably not good to be used as a stationary sprinkler.
-can it get past the joints where two hoses are connected? Yes, I used a hose that had a large connection to see if it could get past it. It had no problem with it.
-can it pull three houses as it goes? Yes. I connected three hoses and put the sprinkler at the far end. It walked all the way with no problems.
-will it shut off? Yes. When it gets to that included .... Ramp thingy it does shut the sprinkler off. I set it up and left for the morning. When I came back it had finished its path and had shut off.
-Does it leak? No. I think if it leaks for you, you need to look at your hose. Maybe it needs new washers. What ever causes the leak it probably is not the fault of the sprinkler.

It has three speeds high low and neutral. I have not used the neutral but both the speeds are good. The high speed is good for a quick sprinkling.  Low is good for a deeper sprinkling.
The sprinkler is heavy. It is solid and seems to be well built. I think that if I take care of it, it will last a long time to come."
5.0,"This tractor sprinkler is big, solid, and stable. It stays on the track you lay for it, and it does an excellent job of watering your lawn. I feel confident enough in it to leave it alone to do its job, but must admit, I also enjoy sitting and watching it do its thing. It is a bit mesmerizing! Its biggest drawback is also its biggest plus --- it is heavy --- but you wouldn't want it any other way!"
5.0,The Rain Train is outstanding! I like the new model since it has a handle and makes it easier to carry. Bottom line---The new model is superb!
5.0,"Love it! Has worked great for me. I have about an acre yard & about 12 trees - I move this a few times a day to cover the whole area, or leave it in one spot to soak in. It doesn't go up hills- so just turn it around- it will go down the hill no problem!"
3.0,This product does as it is advertised. I use it quite frequently during dry periods in the south. It is worth the purchase and giving it a shot.
5.0,My dad is super picky about watering his grass. He also hates the commitment to having to move his sprinkler around constantly so I bought him this for Father's day. These sprinklers are amazing and make a great gift if you've got someone who loves their lawn. I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend purchasing one!
5.0,I love that there are three speed settings. This helps me get all parts of my lawn even though I have a small amount of time to water. This is very efficient.
5.0,Absolutely the best product I have ever purchased!  It's amazing!!!  I highly recommend this product!  It's great for people that have a busy lifestyle.
2.0,"Cheap coated mystery ""metal"" (MIM with a stamped handle) construction with some brass and plastic bits. Unless you remove it from your hose and bring it inside after every use, eventually that coating is going to chip off and the nozzle will start rusting as it's exposed to the elements. From a value perspective, do note that you're spending about 1/3 the cost of a high quality machined brass nozzle."
5.0,I used it to wash my car. Need some tools to connect. But after that works prefect.
4.0,"Good product, wish it was still made in the U.S.A. I want to help President Trump make America Great Again by employing American citizens."
5.0,Solid and easy to use!
5.0,"This Gilmour hose nozzle is a good value and is sturdy, too.  It allows variable water pressures, from sprinkling to high-intensity cleaning. I like how easy it s to use and attach to my hose. I have tried those flimsy plastic nozzles, but they don't last more than a month or two. Indeed, you get what you pay for. This nozzle is a good value."
5.0,"After trying the ""industrial"" nozzles with their cheap plastic triggers, I went back to the tried and true workhorse of hose nozzles. These things last for YEARS with little care except taking them in for the winter"
5.0,This is holding up well. Had it for maybe 6 months. I drip it on the asphalt and it's holding up to the abuse
5.0,This thing is great. It's the nozzle that you remember from when you were a kid. Just a basic squirty nozzle for cheap that doesn't do all the extra bs like spraying in 17 different patterns. And it's metal not plastic. I think I'll buy about 10 more.
3.0,Be careful not to lose the washer sometimes it pops out when you remove the gun from a hose. Ordered like 3 or 4 more of these cause they are cheap as in don't expect them to last forever..
5.0,Better than other multi-spray nozzles at a much better price
5.0,Great product. Very well made and is a breeze to use. Quick to clean out after use and love that you don't waste any product.
5.0,Sprayer works great for spraying the yard with the Talstar insecticide.  Easy to use and easy cleanup.  Can highly recommened this product!
5.0,"I had been looking for a hose end sprayer with enough power to spray moss killer on my roof.  Bingo, this was it, a great price and a good stream.  I have also used it on the yard, loving it."
5.0,"I purchased a this exact same sprayer some 15 years ago. The only reason I purchased a new one is that I lost my old sprayer in a move from our old home. The sprayer meters the product in the jar very, very, well in my experience. June 29 2013, The product had a minute leak in the plastic threads where the bottle is attached to the metal sprayer. I paid it no mind. Unfortunately, the leak has become a gusher. I tightened the part and the leak became worse. I updated the review. I had been unfair to the manufacturer. Confused by the poor perforemance, I completely disasembled the sprayer, reasembled and noticed that the main seal had a fold on the edge. I reversed the seal and carefully threaded it back in to position and it now does not leak. Defects in assembly sometimes happen and I should have been more patient. I have now revaluated the rating back to a 5 star."
5.0,I have used this sprayer several times since I bought it and it works great on all types of liquid fertilizer.  Very easy to use
4.0,Seems to work well. Interesting design. Spray bottle smaller than I expected but does the job. Easy to clean. Recommend
5.0,Very good garden tool. I have been using this for over a year now.  It mixes the liquid chemicals orrectly and provides great coverage when using.  It is easy to use and easy to clean. I would recommend this to others.
4.0,I chose this sprayer because it looked to be made out of metal.  The connection to the hose is plastic.  There's some fancy mechanism that I suppose is to let the air out of the hose but all it does is help the connection to leak.  The spray is fantastic.  I would give it a 5 if it didn't leak and if it would stand up on its own.  The leaking is minimal but it still leaks.  Im going to end up making a stand for it because it will drain if it falls over and it is 100% guaranteed to fall over.  Those two things are minimal compared to how it functions.  I would say I get a distance of about 15 feet and a perfect pattern of about 8 to 10 feet wide at 15 feet.  I use it to spray bleach in dog kennels before pressure washing.  It is the best one I've used so far.
5.0,This is the best sprayer I have ever owned. The only problem I have is that the little spray diffuser fell off and now I need to replace it.
3.0,"I bought this to spray Miracle-Gro on my garden.  I use the powder and try to pre-mix, since using straight powder in the cannister doesn't work.  It works *okay*, but nothing special- and the adjustment options seem to really only do one of two things: use all the nutrient near-instantly, or barely any at all after 10 minutes of use.  Sadly this isn't much better than the crappy all plastic POS that Miracle-Gro ships with their product.

To be fair, this is designed for liquid mix so I will try pre-made liquid plant food and see if it works any better."
5.0,Just what I needed.  Fair price.
5.0,"Nice product, easy to work with and the padding stops you from getting blisters."
5.0,Yes
4.0,"Great price and they work well. For the medium duty yard work I do once every couple months, these are perfect"
5.0,"Comfortable, can use for both hands.  Can't hand more than an inch thick brush, but nice, clean cuts."
4.0,"The paint definitely chips off after the first use, but I've now had them for several months and they've met all of my floral arrangement needs."
4.0,ok
2.0,"Does not cut clean, but they do work"
5.0,extra sharp for hard cutting
4.0,"These really are not meant to get wet. I accidentally left them in my yard when the sprinklers went off and a few hours later, they had dried and have been stiff ever since. They still work but they take more effort to use. Learn from my mistakes!"
5.0,I have had one of these in the past. They are truly worth the cost! Turn it on and forget about it. We have limited watering times here and I am able to be in compliance with this sprinkler.
4.0,"Haven't had success with it travelling as far as the ads say it will before the wheels begin to spin and it turns over.  Once I found out how far I could trust it, we get the job done very nicely.  I had one before which froze and busted and the unit had been phased out so I ordered this one.  It appears a little more sturdy than the John Deere model."
3.0,"They warn you to not let this sprinkler travel on cement, but I didn't read that until too late.  Would be  a great sprinkler except for this problem...  Unfortunately, this apparently strips the gear mechanism.  POOR design..."
5.0,Have used Amazon many times-always a good experience.  Have owned Nelson traveling sprinklers in the past and were happy with product and needed to replace old ones.  They came promptly and price was very good.  Would recommend to any one needing to buy traveling sprinklers and would recommend using Amazon to purchase them.
4.0,We have only used it a couple times but so far we are very happy with it. It is not heavy and hard to move/change locations as other reviews have indicated. And I have been pleasantly surprised with the corners that it is able to make. And with the adjustable angle of the arm it can cover a large area down to a pretty tight one. So far it has been worth every penny!
5.0,"When I opened the box, I immediately realized I had purchased something meant for a much larger lawn. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot and was impressed at how well it worked. The rotating arms are easily adjusted meaning you can water a large or small area in a single pass. In my case, the sprinkler can water my entire lawn following a straight line. You can also get creative if you want to water longer by laying out the hose in intricate way. It's sort of fun too as you start looking at the lawn like a game of overlapping pipe dream.

In the end, the build quality, efficiency and flexibility of the sprinkler has won me over so I'll be keeping it. It will likely survive long after I move to a bigger home."
5.0,Great product keeps you worry free for the most part. When working correctly the thing you have to do is move the water hose.
2.0,Bought it in August. Worked great last summer but now the housing and the connection of the sprinkler head to the body is leaking like crazy. With all the water pressure leaking away the speed and watering is diminished. Will see if I can tighten the screws or something.
5.0,This is the easiest and best sprinkler on the market for watering large areas.  Set it and forget it with the automatic shut off wedge.
5.0,we rally love our sprinkler have used it a lot it is worth the money have had no problems thank you
5.0,Good price that works as stated. Using to spray castor oil mixed with dish detergent on yard for moles and voles.
3.0,"after just a couple of uses, I find it doesn;t jet as far as claimed. Maximum range is about 18 feet, not the 25-plus itsuggests. as I was spreading moss killer on an inaccessible  roof, this was critical."
5.0,Works as advertised! This product surpassed another sprayer which didn't project as far as this one. I would recommend to others.
5.0,"If you don't want to sweat the small stuff, this makes life so much easier. Just pour the concentrate in, plug in the hose and get going. Made lawn maintenance that much easier in the summer.

Had a gallon/2 gallon/5 gallon sprayer and the constant mixing/carrying around took way more time besides being exposed to more chemicals each time I had to mix  and pump it. This one blows them all away and held up nicely for one summer of use. Will update later on if anything changes.

* This product does contain brass - which can cause cancer as per California guidelines - not a negative, but something to be aware off, as with any lawn care products. Use disposable gloves and do not touch the brass part."
3.0,I've had several different pre mix sprayers over the years. This one is right there in the middle of them all...actually when I think about it they all pretty much rate the same. Bought to use mostly on applications of algae and moss solutions on both cement patios and roofs. It does a decent enough job but you've got to watch close when you use it to make sure it's pulling the concentrate out at the prescribed amount. It isn't all that difficult but it's not as one would like to have all that no thinking done for you either. But overall this one is made well enough and not too cheap. I hope it works for 4-5 years at least and I believe the bottle has a universal opening so if need be could switch out the bottle to replace. The length of the bottle will be important as the hose that sucks the solution up is only the length of the orginal bottle. That too may be easily replaced or not. I didn't look into it with this item yet. It works...it's not great...but it works as long as you pay attention to it.
5.0,"After struggling with the Ortho type plastic hose-end sprayer I finally gave up. Stores in my area don't carry the Gilmore sprayer that I used years ago, so I was happy to find it at Amazon. It proved to work very well with Roundup and Monterey Weed Impede. It also appears to be more accurate in metering the dose as I was able to cover the same area with much less material. The Gilmore sprayer is much less frustrating to use as the two plastic sprayers I tried continually stopped and clogged. It took much less time to spray and the weeds died without any misses from a clogged sprayer. I bought two of the Gilmore sprayers, just in case they disappear again when I need one. I may be set for life as the last one lasted at least a decade."
3.0,"I used this sprayer heavily this summer clearing two large lots of all vegetation.  Every month or so I would
have to replace washer in handle attachment to hose and the washer connecting spray bottle to handle.
I tried various brands but within a few weeks they would leak a little and then a lot.  Local store said they
have had same trouble and gave me some updated washers but they didn't last any longer

One other little thorn is the dial that sets the mixture of spray to water gets gummy and hard to turn.  I
don't know of anything better out there so will continue again next summer."
5.0,Wow...This little thing really shoots the spray up all over the trees.  Much less work than a pump sprayer.  Best replacement for the no longer made long nose Ortho tree sprayer.
4.0,I haven't had it long enough to be able to judge its durability. I have only used it once to spray some shrubs and a 20 ft tree and I didn't have any problem using it. Figuring out the ratios can be a bit daunting but I knew that going in.
5.0,"I tried to refurbish my old Hudson sprayer,with no luck. I read the reviews about the Gilmore Sprayer and decided to give it a try. Works great."
4.0,Works good for the price
5.0,"It does exactly what I need it to.
And, seems quite sturdy - although I haven't tried slamming it down on the flag stone patio (I don't want to break the stones).
I do plan to take it inside during the winter.  I have seen a little water inside metal plumbing fixtures freeze and totally destroy otherwise strong metal."
4.0,Great price. Works great. Would earn 5-stars if it had an adjustable nozzle tip.
5.0,These are great sprayers! Don't let the simplicity fool you. I'm never buying a sprayer with multiple spray patterns again.
5.0,Bought this for my mother and she like the metal handle. Sturdy and good quality!
5.0,"I was a little weary about the ""no frill no fuss"" look of this attachment....but it's performing exactly how I hoped it would! The nozzle adjusts the water pressure based on how hard you squeeze it, so don't worry that this doesn't come with different jet styles."
4.0,"after 50 years, it is the only product on the market that works"
1.0,Gasket busted within two weeks.
5.0,Easy to use. Wide array of sprays.
1.0,Bought it in April 2017.  Have barely used it for 3 months and now is rusted and leaks water.  Quality is terrible.  Do not buy
5.0,Bought these for harvesting plants for herbal medicine making. They work very well on branches as well as on more delicate stems.
5.0,"Cut small branches with ease, just have to clean and oil the blades"
5.0,easy to use.  Stays sharp.
5.0,My new favourite instrument - I look forward to pruning and taking cuttings now (he he he).
4.0,"Excellent for pruning soft green branches; comfortable, easy to use when reaching into difficult spots, well made.
(Hard branches dull the Bypass blade, so use an Anvil pruner for hard branches.)"
5.0,"This Pruning Shears is excellent tools. Tool for professional cutting and gardening. This hand tool is so incredibly useful and versatile around the house, I don't know where to begin."
4.0,These pruners were bough to trim small bushes and plants in my yard. They aren't the sharpest because any bushes that have a small anount of diameter to them makes it difficult to cut through. I would just use these for really small diameter objects. It has a locking mechanism to it to keep them in the closed position when not in use. It has a comfortable grib that makes it easy to hold and prune. The curved tip is great for hooking around small branches that you don't want to cut. I recommend these for some starter pruners.
5.0,Gave to sister as a gift (she needed some) and she loves them.  I bought a pair for me and I see why - they are so sharp and cut through 1/4' shrub branches
5.0,Strong and reliable. I used these all summer and they are perfect for pruning the thick stems on my roses.
5.0,Great purchased! I am happy that this has a great quality and really have an affordable price.
5.0,"One is years old and then this one.  I love them.  They last, work as advertised and save me hours of going out and moving hoses.
If I ever need another this is the brand I will select every time!"
5.0,"I saw that one of my neighbors had one of these, but he told me he got it from his grandfather, who'd had it since he was a kid.

Luckily, I learned that they're still being made! This sprinkler is heavy and built to last. I have a large yard, but can get it all done with a minimum of hose-fiddling since this thing will travel along a 100 foot hose and get a large portion of the yard with each pass."
5.0,"Set it, turn it on and forget it. (Well almost.) Normally it does its job without fail, but occasionally it will jump the hose decide to wander off seeking new pastures to water.
It's great at what its designed for, I sit it to a small circle for the side of the house, then run 100 ft of hose out and around the front year; and just forget it while the entire front yard is getting watered. While one is doing the front yard, another is doing the back.
Takes 2-1/2 hours to do the front, about 8 for the back. But at least I don't have to run out and change the location of the sprinkler every twenty minutes or so. Just set it up (about five minutes to drag the house around, forming a pattern for it to follow, set the shutoff ramp, and forget it. When it gets down, it (usually) shuts itself off."
5.0,I bought this during a restricted watering summer to optimize watering on our yard & to not over water & do my part to conserve during a dry summer.  Like the fact that when it hits the end of it's setting that it has an automatic shutoff to stop the flow of water.  This sprinkler did a great job & would definetley purchase again.
5.0,its great just set it up and watch it go.  if you forget about at least it will shut it self off
5.0,"<div id=""video-block-R18UEK2MMZGCUB"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91RLGq6CtyS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31-uRwxWvmS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;I LOVE my sprinklers.  I bought 4 of these (gave one away, and use 3).  The video shows yellow patches, but we've just started watering again after winter (that green has come back in only 2 weeks).  These things are pretty much worry free.  A bit of a learning curve, but once you get the nack... they rock."
5.0,I have almost ran this sprinkler non stop this summer without any glitches. it will climb a pretty good hill however if the dirt is loose it will dig a hole and just set and spin it is wheels.
5.0,It runs on its own and you do not have to go out and change it to different areas.  Just place it on the hose and it goes until it runs out of hose and then it shuts itself off.  I could not have been more pleased with the product.  It was so pleasing a few others in the neighborhood bought one similiar to mine.
5.0,"The original box of the product was a little beat up, but the tractor looks like it has never been used and everything is included."
5.0,These little tractors are great.  Set and go.  They get the yard watered and does a thorough job. Sturdy enough to use in big yards.
4.0,"Why did I buy so many plastic pump sprayers when I could have used this all along? Now I know better and so should you. Easy to understand mixing guide, just set the dial to the number of ounces of the product you intend to use to what you would have put in a typical pump sprayer for each gallon of water. Remove all parts when done and clean them with tap water. Why did I give just 4 stars? The spray handle the device is attached to is way too cheap for what could have been a truly fantastic product. Never too late to make it right Gilmour!!!"
5.0,"I use this sprayer to apply cleaning/sanitizing solutions in a commercial setting. I use relatively benign chemicals (oxyclean and citric acid) to sanitize winery surfaces but all the other sprayers I have tried use cheap plastic which corrodes from the oxyclean (a strong solution but nothing I wouldn't put my hand in) while the Gilmour stays perfectly intact. I'm not sure how accurate the dilution settings are, but you can definitely change the strength of a solution by twisting the dial. I use 160 degree water with oxyclean and it works great."
5.0,Thus far I love this thing. I was able to quickly spray all my plants to get rid of the bugs. I had to wait because it was on backorder but I'm glad I did.
2.0,"I must have been very naive when it comes to hose-end sprayers, and perhaps I should have done more research on these types of products before buying this one.  But nonetheless, the ratio for this sprayer are on the extreme weak side.  Meaning, the best you can do is spray 9 tablespoons of chemical to 1 gallon of water.  So, there's no dealing in ""typical"" parts. i.e., 2:1, 3:1, it's more like 256 to 1 when using this sprayer!  This maximum ratio is rather pointless if you are spraying, let's say bleach, onto moldy exterior home siding.  There's 256 tablespoons in 1 gallon of water, so the maximum value on this spreader only permits a maximum ratio of 28 parts water to 1 part chemical (in my case, bleach).  Now what's that supposed to do!  At any rate, I should have done a bit more digging before purchasing this product, and now I'm stuck with it.  Perhaps I could use it fertilize my lawn when the time comes so that it isn't a total waste.  The nozzle that comes attached to it is rather powerful for your typical garden hose sprayer, so maybe I can put that to use, who knows!  On a positive note, the product did arrive on time and well packaged."
5.0,Much nicer than any previously syphon sprayer I've owned and not much more expensived.  Works great and feels well made.  I have been cleaning after every use.
5.0,Works perfectly and is a sturdy device for the price.  I would purchase it again if i needed another and is much easier to use then having to pre-mix everything prior to spraying.
5.0,"I've used the Gilmour 362 Sprayer once.  It's construction seems pretty good, much better than the other ones I've seen.  I did not perform the test they recommend to be sure it is sucking up the right amount of chemicals given your water pressure. I will next time I use it, as I think it didn't suck up the right amount of chemicals.  But, I still recommend this sprayer -- it's the best one I've seen."
1.0,did not spray 30ft as promised only about 12ft. after spraying for more that 10 minutes the amount of the chemical tnat had been displaced in the sprayer was less than a quater of an inch so just spraying water. waste of time!
5.0,"After looking at the hose-end sprayers available at big orange and big blue, they all seemed poorly made and not likely to last long. After searching for a better item, I settled on this Gilmour sprayer based on the reviews on Amazon. I have used the sprayer a number of times this summer and it has been wonderful.

The part that attaches to the hose is a just a metal sprayer, which can be replaced if it wears out. The rest of the unit is made of quality parts and I expect to use this sprayer for many years to come. I am very pleased with it."
1.0,All products that contain lead should disclose this fact at the point of sale. This product contains lead and this is not disclosed on Amazon's website under the product description or product details.
5.0,"Good sprayer.  If it is more durable than the higher priced ones, it will be perfect."
5.0,Works great easy to use.
5.0,High quality nozzle - far better than those carried at Home Depot or Lowes.
4.0,works well.  Would prefer more water pressure though
4.0,As expected
5.0,"Love this nozzle. Sturdy, simple, and gets the job done."
3.0,Cheap metal. Perhaps good for the price. Can tell it won't last many seasons.
5.0,So much better than leaky plastic versions
5.0,"5 stars as advertised, buy with confidence"
5.0,I love the classic Gilmore hose nozzles
5.0,Excellent shears and would buy again.
5.0,Good quality. Quick service.
5.0,I love this tool. It is sturdy and reliable when I do my repairs. This is incredible!
5.0,These pruning shears are better than any other shears I've purchased and I've owned my house and have been pruning for 21 years. They really cut through the branches and I use them mainly on my Rose of Sharons and they are very woody. I use them on branches as thick as 3/4 inch in diameter and I have never had an issue. They are very high quality and well worth the price. Much more expensive in the store.
5.0,didn't know I needed a new pair so desperately till i used these!  cuts like butter
5.0,"Great quality and best brand.  We have a number of Fiskars's tools including shears, clippers and we are very happy.  Easy grips and use.  Fiskars tools will last for a long time.  We will continue to purchase Fiskar's tools and highly recommend them to others."
2.0,"Just like the last pair, rubber handles slip off metal when using them. Makes it hard to hang onto. Will buy a different brand next time."
5.0,Shape and nice
4.0,"Pruning? Yeah, I guess so but I didn't buy these for pruning. These quite-sharp shears are good for cutting other things too, I bought them for cutting thick foam ( think pipe insulation ). They excel at that job. I have actually used these to cut thick rope too and if I think about it long enough, I could come up with a bunch more uses.

They're sturdy shears from a company known for good products.

ABOUT ME:
I finally got fed up with the traffic and lack of competing products to choose from when shopping at the local big-box stores so now I do almost all my shopping on Amazon. I recently read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyber-Fraud-The-Web-of-Lies/dp/1514273004/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyber Fraud: The Web of Lies</a>&nbsp;by Brian Seely, about Google Map frauds and have taken to heart that the best way to counter fake reviews is for legitimate customers to post more real reviews. Currently, 100% of my reviews are for products that I paid full price for. In the future, if I some how manage to convince a company to send me something for free, you can rest assured that I won't be changing my opinion of a product based on what I paid for it. I want the best products available and we should all be able to know what they are. If you find this review helpful, witty, charming, absurd, let me know by clicking on one of those buttons right there...no, a little lower, now right...there!"
5.0,This is the second pair I've had to purchase in a year. My last pair was commandeered by my master gardener mother-n-law. They're amazing.
5.0,Worked like a charm.  Used to wash outside of home and garage.  Performed perfectly and made the job very easy.  Highly recommend.  Amazingly modest price for such a quality product.
4.0,"I bought this to spray some bug poison on the outside of my house. Aside from a little leakage where the end of the metal sprayer attaches to the mixer, and on top of the dialer when turned sideways, the sprayer works very well.

When you take the plastic nozzle off the sprayer, it WILL spray about 30 feet. This was really helpful when I started spraying the trees in my backyard.

This was well worth the $15 I spent.

*I should note that you should be mindful of the thickness of your solution. I noticed that the bug poison I was spraying started to clog up the pick up in the sprayer. This obviously reduced the concentration I was spraying at. I ended up diluting the poison 50% with water and mixing it up very well. Then I adjusted the dial on the sprayer so that I ended up spraying at the right concentration.*"
2.0,Seriously this product is not worth the money how can you put PROFESSIONAL on a product that is no better than the plastic bottle sprayer that products typically are sold with.
5.0,"Great lightweight sprayer that premixes products with a capacity to return unused product.
I have several garden hose sprayers, none of which were adequate for the job of weedkilling, eradicating moss/algae.
I would recommend this sprayer because it does the job of proper solution dilution.  It works great!!!"
1.0,"I had one of these before and I was satisfied with it for the most part, until it broke. But when I attached the new one I bought to my hose and turned the hose on, it was stuck spraying, even though the handle was not depressed. I had to run back to the spigot before all my solution was gone. No instructions gave any clue as to why this could be happening or how to correct it. I don't have time to deal with this."
5.0,"We purchased this sprayer to use to apply Roundup to a 3,000 square foot area we are converting to native grass and wildflowers.  The area was infested with Creeping Charlie/Chickweed/Creeping Jenny.  It also has several trees.  It was too large for a small tank sprayer and too complicated (the trees) for a boom sprayer.  We read the reviews for the Gilmour 362, Scotts products, and some others.  We bought the Gilmour, and it works perfectly.  Easy to use, well built, clear instructions, and did the job in very sort order.  Just to be sure, we treated the area twice, and now have it tilled, seeded, and growing nicely.  The entire project was made much easier with the use of this sprayer."
4.0,"Just used it.  Seems to be pretty sturdy and works well.  I did notice a couple small leaks but they were mostly on the outside handle at the connection with my hose. Could just as well have been my hose end which is old. I found the little deflector on the front nozzle to be pretty limited in scope. It's not really adjustable that I could see...and shortens the spray to a few feet with very soft water flow (albeit a wider pattern).  So, you've got this soft, wide pattern for a few feet. Or a fairly strong stream that can go out 20 feet or more. Not much in between. As long as that works for you, it's good to go.

Other than that, seemed to work as advertised. For cleaning, I used a bottle of water to place the pickup stem in ...and then spray. This pulls fresh water through the internal components and flushes them. Other review says they submerge the whole thing in a bucket of water which would work just as well I suppose. I just wash the outside off, as the point of clearing it is mainly to flush the inside components such that they don't get gummed up -- I didn't find it necessary to submerse the unit to clean it properly.  Another tip I could add is that 2 liter soda bottle caps fit the sprayer bottle perfectly.  So, I just cap what's left in the bottle and save it for the next run.

I'm mainly using this for soap and water treatment of a fruit tree that has white flies. With the deflector removed, it has plenty of stream to get to the top of the tree, blast the buggers out, and there are visible signs of soap/suds as well. So, it seems to be working fine. So far, so good."
5.0,I needed a sprayer to kill insects on smaller shrubs as well as on a huge Oak tree and this sprayer handled both extremely well. The end nozzle piece turns so that the liquid sprays either downwards or upwards and can be taken completely off to shoot a 30 foot stream. It worked great.
2.0,Sprays OK but every part of it leaks. Big dissapointment would buy something else. Not worth the price. This is my review and I am sticking to it
5.0,"This sprayer is fantastic.  Put what you want to spray in the plastic bottle, set the metering dial to the correct amount to dispense (i.e. 1TBS/gal, 1tsp/gal...whatever)...hook up to the hose and spray.  Since no water enters the bottle you can return any leftover to the original package - I've never seen any other sprayer do this.  ...and does it reach 30ft.??  Yes it does when you remove the black deflector.  Just be sure to rinse it out well before putting it away.  I would HIGHLY recommend this sprayer...there is no 'waste' of product you are spraying, it is so easy to 'dial' the device to the correct dilution...I just can't say how happy I am with this product.  Add to that - it is MADE IN THE USA, lifetime warranty....what more can you as for???  Do not hesitate to buy this one.  ...I also bought the 'cheaper model'...spend the extra for this one!!  The other is very similar, but this one is so much better made.  Thank you AMAZON for another great product...and with Prime it was here in two days and at a lower price than a local store that supposedly carried it."
5.0,I have used this for 2 seasons now. Had bought another brand a few years back and the gears stripped out in the first season of use. I was very leery of buying another on but due to the reviews I gave this one a try. It has held up very well.
5.0,Really love this and would recommend it to all considering purchasing in future.  Just what the wife wanted Great Product!
4.0,It works really good very impressed with it. I would reccomend this to anyone interested in purchasing a sprinkler very efficient.
1.0,I have a large yard that had no sprinklers installed.  I thought this would make my life a lot easier by doing my watering duties for me.  I tried to set this up with and I couldn't get it to move.  It just sat there shooting water.  I opened it up and found the gears were frozen.  They must have been damaged in shipping since the body of this thing is really heavy.
4.0,A good sprinkler for large areas that are fairly level. Have to pay attention to making gradual curves. Seems to be well built and should last if taken care of.
2.0,"Gears didn't last long at all. After if failed to stop with the stopping triangle, it continued to try to run and stripped the gears inside"
5.0,Really like to old reliable design with it's modern updates in materials. Best bang for the buck in my opinion.
5.0,"Good way to water lawn and envy of neighborhood.  It looks so cool tracking around the lawn and some  cars have stopped to admire it. I have had it only one summer and  have had no problems at all.  I particularly like the ease of adjusting the spray area, and can adjust the area of coverage by the length of hose used."
5.0,"Outstanding, works great, shuts off automatically and I don't have to keep moving sprinklers all day long.  Follow recommendations for hose length, any longer and it can't pull the hose along."
4.0,"Works as described. I've had better luck with using a heavy duty water hose. The cheaper hoses will curl up, causing the sprinklers arms to hang up on the hose, or the tractor will go off the hose."
2.0,"I don't know if I just got a defective product but after some spraying, the weed killer that is in the plastic bottle was being diluted with water and when weed killer is 40 dollars a bottle it really is a big deal to have a lot go to waste on top of the weeds not getting the full effect of the product. It sprayed really well I just don't know how effective the weed killer will be.  :( Sad I was really excited to have an easier time controlling weeds"
5.0,I HAVE ONLY USED IT ONCE AND IT WORKED AS ADVERTISED. NO PROBLEM WITH UNIT SO FAR. I DID FILL THE SPRAYER WITH WATER TO FLUSH IT OUT. SOMEONE SAID THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH PLUGING UP. I WILL SEE WHEN I USE IT AGAIN.
5.0,"Great sprayer, low cost great capacity and best of all no leaks! I use this sprayer to spray spectracide weed killer for lawns and fertilizers. It has a dial to get the proper mix ratio (teaspoons AND tablespoons) and disassembles for easy clean up. I feel it is good quality for the price and see my self using it for years to come."
4.0,"Unit works well.

PROS:

1. Top dial selects the dilution rate i.e. number of tablespoons or teaspoons (if you insert the small restrictor into the siphon tube) per gallon of water. You may need to do a bit of math if the instructions that came with whatever you want to spray are in fl.oz/gallon or similar.

CONS:
1. Unit will leak contents through small hole in top of valve if tipped over i.e. if you put the hose on the ground and bottle lays on its side. Understandable why - just worth being aware of.
2. Although the description on Amazon says ""Made in USA"" it is (currently) only the plastic bottle is made in the US, the handle is made in China (so I'm knocking off a star - probably should be two stars but the unit does work well - so far.)"
4.0,"This unit failed on the second filling of my first use. The red grommet at the end of the valve body that the trigger pulls against came flying off and the only reason I found it was I heard it hit the sidewalk. This does not look like a fix I can do. It looks like it was pressed on hot or glued, and if it was glued they used very little glue causing failure. So I managed to finish spraying my full bottle by grabbing the end of the valve with pliers and then using the trigger. A clumsy two handed trick that got it done but raised my dork factor with my neighbors to the extreme.

The sprayer itself worked very well. Decent spread, pulled the mix very well and it has a definite edge to the spray so you can cut in to sidewalks etc and not waste your fertilizer. I really liked everything about the sprayer. Fired it up right out of the box with good results. The sprayer breaks down into parts well but I can't see how it would stand up to me forcing the grommet back on, and then how to make it stay. This is that hard plastic I have had trouble gluing before. Drill a hole is a possibility but that small shaft - keeper hole size = fail I think.

So what to do? The sprayer handle has a female thread unlike the recent nozzle I just bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-Salt-Water-and-Marine-Nozzle-474S/dp/B000FK008W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S</a>&nbsp;with a male. ( same design and has not failed ) it is identical except plastic and opposite threads so a direct switch is out. This is what does bother me, the need for a female end to attach sprayer. So I guess F to F hose adapter but alignment issues when tight,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerwasher-80006-Universal-Pressure-Washer-Brass-Garden-Hose-Quick-Connect-Kit/dp/B000EEQ9L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerwasher 80006 Universal Pressure Washer Brass Garden Hose Quick-Connect Kit</a>&nbsp;looks better but I am approaching cost of the sprayer. Most likely what I will do.

I don't think this is a common failure point with these sprayers but if others are having this problem Gilmour needs a redesign. I rated it four stars it worked real good and my results might just be bad luck. The exact sprayer design I have been using for a while shown above, is still working fine leads me to believe this. Sprayer portion-5 stars. I could just attach a hose to the sprayer just wouldn't have an off/on. Use the old school crimp the hose as we did as kids lol.

I did look at the F to F adapters again, looks like they do swivel until tight so maybe the alignment issue is moot. Might go this route."
5.0,"I purchased this item after comparing prices and reviews on other similar products, and after years of limping along and frequently replacing cheap, all plastic versions. It worked perfectly on the first try.

The real test is after considerable use. I'll update when it's had at least a season of work outs in my expanded garden this season."
5.0,A very durable sprayer with actual metal parts and enough jet power to reach into trees about 25 feet.  Sprayer nozzle also has a wide-spray attachment for shrubs and lawns.
5.0,"I spent hours searching for a sprayer that could shoot far. I've tried every hose end dial sprayer there is, and before almost spending $250.00 on a commercial one (that I was pretty sure wouldn't shoot far) I bought this one. It is heavy duty and I'm so happy! You cannot let stuff sit in it and I wash it thourghly after each use. I am buying two more right now for my dad and father-in-law!"
4.0,"I use this sprayer to apply all sorts of lawn and garden concentrates.  The spray is consistent and even.  The handle is all metal which is really nice.  No more plastic nozzles leaking all over the place.  The spray handle is a great upgrade from the built lawn fertilizer spray bottles with the plastic tab to turn on and off the sprayer.

The only draw back is that the bottle is only 16oz.  I emailed the manufacturer to see if you could use a bigger bottle but they said no.  So, if you have a really large area, look somewhere else unless you don't mind stopping to refill."
5.0,"I wish I had found this sprayer 20 years ago so I could have avoided all the frustration and wasted money I have spent over the years.  After using this, the three I had went in the trash because they were a constant problem and a big headache.  This is wise investment if you work in your yard as much as I do!  Absolutely a great product and especially for the price."
5.0,Heavy duty and high quality!
5.0,I have three pairs of these clippers and have to keep writing my name on them so folks borrowing them. Good around hand-clippers that stay sharp and last.
5.0,"Very good quality for the money, I would certainly buy again,"
5.0,This is a great pruning tool.
5.0,Very sharp and easy to use.
5.0,I had purchased the smaller one and it worked very well.  It is comfortable in your hand.  It is extremely sharp and makes quick work of small branches.  The locking mechanism is easy to you use.
5.0,"These Fiskar pruning shears are fabulous, nice and sharp with a safety guard to open and close. I use them all the time and you cannot go wrong with the Fiskar brand! I highly recommend these shears for those of us that like to work in the Garden!"
5.0,"Works well, decent price. Can say much more."
5.0,"These simple traditional Shears beat out the previous ""improved"" ones I had purchased by Fiskars, and were a third of the price here on Amazon.  Does just what they are designed to do.  No problems thus far with using them throughout the season."
5.0,Best pruners I have purchased.  And easy on hand and a are comfortable to use
5.0,"Simple to use, well made, great stream and spray. Ditch the overly mechanical, over priced spray heads for this one...you'll be very pleased!"
5.0,Solid nozzel
5.0,I bought this because I was tired of having to constantly replace those plastic nozzles.  I am hoping that this will the last one I buy for awhile.  It works great and the power is awesome.  Great buy.  Buy it and see for yourself.
5.0,It looked to my water hose that I leave on . No leaks it's always ready
2.0,"The packaging is absolutely terrible. The nozzle is held to the paper packaging by a rock hard black plastic nubbin. Problem is, the nubbin fits so snug against the nozzle that it's very difficult to get underneath and cut the nubbin off. I tried to use a box cutter but the nubbin is quite thick and I accidentally scratched one of the screws. I would rather not scratch the surface as the thick silver coating is designed to prevent rust formation. The trick is to squeeze the lever so you get a bit more space, and then fit the tips of some heavy duty scissors. I tried cutting the nubbin, but wasn't successful so I tugged and pulled it out towards the rear. It's amazing the product designers don't think about this crucial detail. The nubbin is such thick and solid plastic that I almost imagined that perhaps it could be part of the nozzle's design. I'm attaching photos to illustrate what I mean."
3.0,"It gets rusty after a while and doesn't work as when brand new. Ok for the price, but will not last."
2.0,"Product feels like cheap plastic.  I have only used it a few times and seems to work.  However, I would not get this again.  Not like the old metal versions I had 20 years ago."
1.0,barely used-- had since last March 2016 and now it does not work
5.0,finally a new sprayer that doesn't leak and get my all wet
4.0,basic sprayer as expected
5.0,Great product. I love this brand. Would buy again.
5.0,"Excellent. A very good value. Couldn't find my expensive pair, these work just as well!"
5.0,Excelent product
5.0,"Fiskars makes great products. We've had several pairs of these bypass pruning shears over the years and we keep buying them because they are great to have around the yard. Now, if only I could stop my son and husband from using them for things other than the intended purpose, that would be golden!"
5.0,"My pruners are an extension of my arm, so it is very important that I have a great one.
I love these.
Excellent quality."
5.0,These are the handiest shear to have around. They work very well and are very easy on the hand.
4.0,Do the trick - nice and sharp!
5.0,This thing can cut through anything.
2.0,The shears don't close all the way. The shear is bent and can't close all the way... Waste of money!!! Get a better quality set!
4.0,Works well
4.0,"Glad that I purchased this sprayer. It work very well
and easy to use. I strongly recommend to others to buy."
5.0,"Gilmour 362 Professional No Pre-Mix Sprayer is awesome.  Honestly the extra $5-6 dollars it cost over the plastic competition to purchase this is well worth it.  Can be used for fertilizer or washing the cars.  Very easy to use and the teaspoon to tablespoon converter is so easy.  I just unscrew the converter from the top and insert it into the straw suction in the bottle and I'm done.  I filled the bottle with Maxicrop Fish emulsion 5-1-1 concentrate.  The water will mix automatically and dilute it so that's why I used the concentrate directly into the container.  Choose 1-2 teaspoon per gallon and wonderful results on my lawn, flowers, and veggies.  Everything is so green and healthy looking.  I think this sprayer will last a very long time.  Very happy customer."
4.0,"I waited for couple of months to review this.
Initially I though it may work and may not but I found following.
For most part it works as it is described.
For some thick solutions it does not work as well and so I did some dilution calculation and used it and found that it works really well.
I will recommend the product provided understanding the limitation."
3.0,"I thought I could use this with miracle grow powder, but following the mix rates for the Gilmour(1 tbs/5 ounces water, set at 10 per instructions)), the jar runs out in less than 2 minutes.
I thought this could replace the miracle grow dispenser that has poor reviews, but at least that dispenser feeds for 15 minutes filling the container once.
The nozzle is also not good at all for soaking individual pots, it sprays out over a wide area, more for foliage spray than soaking the roots.
Please let me know what I'm missing....filling that tiny container every few minutes is crazy."
5.0,"At first didn't set dispenser dial right cuz it's marking is small on bottle, missed it and mistakenly lined up numbers with nozzle (2 tsp/gal so took long time to empty bottle while spraying yard).  Next time I went to use it the fertilizer didn't come out of the bottle at all.  I then read the manual and found out you should clean (run clean water through, no fertilizer) after each use.  Sure enough some fertilizer got stuck in sprayer part, used safety pin to clear hole in sprayer assembly, cleaned with water and set dial properly (at max, 10tsp/gal for powder to liquid mix, line up with little dot on side of sprayer right beneath dial) and has worked like a charm since.  Good product and instructions, read em first (;"
2.0,"It seems like a quality product made from good materials, but the design did not work for me. I was interested in spraying liquid fertilizer and a milk solution recommended to combat lawn mildew. For these uses, it took over an hour of spraying to empty the container even on the highest setting. This rate may be OK for spraying potent chemicals, but not for fertilizer. My water pressure is a bit low, so that could have contributed to the problem. I had to return it."
4.0,"The brass fittings work well & run smoothly, no leakage & simple to use.  The teaspoon converter is easy to use & change.  With the included sprayer handle, it makes it a bit awkward to store, but worth it."
5.0,We originally purchased this product in 1972 and have used it ever since. It held up well and just needed replacing. This replacement is the same .  We used it  with clorex bleach recently to clean algae off our vinyl siding. Worked great.  Was able to spray up high on the house (2-story) and wash off the stains.  Will also use it as prescribed with lawn chemicals.
5.0,"This product is simply the best I've ever used.  I will not mention other brands but will say they simply do not compete.  It is extremely well made, easy to use & easy to clean.  I wiped out a small field of some very nasty & skin-irritating weeds as fast as humanly possible."
4.0,"This sprayer is a solidly built product and for the money works very well.  It allows you to hit the tops of trees about 30 ft. away and does a good job on Medium sized trees and shrubs.  I would recommend trying it before scheduling a tree spray with a landscaping, but  do your homework on the infestation first and use the right chemicals."
4.0,Inexpensive but works well.
5.0,Best ever!
5.0,Great price and simple operation - generates a good bit of power.
5.0,"I really like this item. I am reading a lot of complains on here, but it's made of metal, feels solid, and doesn't leak at all. I needed a nozzle with threads on the outlet to connect a foam sprayer to wash my car, and this one works great. The spray is adjustable and you can lock it on if needed. It's basic but it works."
5.0,"Awesome hose sprayer! I was originally looking at some other models with different options since i thought this one might only be a jet stream, but that certainly isn't the case. Depending on the pressure that you place on the handle depends on the pressure stream being pushed out of the hose. So if you have the handle halfway pressed the stream will be more of a shower (good for plants). This is exactly what i was looking for, and i can tell that the build quality on this item is super high so it will last many years to come! Super happy with my purchase!"
5.0,old school!
4.0,"What I received looks like the pictures however the packaging label identifies the nozzle as ""Medium Duty"" not ""Heavy Duty"".  This is probably a more appropriate label as this order is replacing my current nozzle (same design) which is failing after 3-4 years of use. Still a good price for a useful nozzle."
3.0,"OK quality, but made out of pot-metal. Also, the old brass nozzle is now a plastic one. I wonder how long it will last?"
5.0,"OK, it's just a sprayer, but it is very well made and works extremely well. I've had little kids playing with it and dropping it on the driveway, it has not broken at all. Minimalist design, highly recommended."
5.0,Love how this Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler  walks along with out you having to drag the hose all over the yard.. and how once it hits the bump it shuts off the water with out you having to get soaked or run to the valve to shut it off great product I have two now one ive had over 10 years wonderful no problems with this one!!!
5.0,Perfect for my wide open flat large yard. Solved all my problems without the expense of an in ground irrigation system. Fascinating piece of equipment. Well made.
1.0,The tractor worked for one month and then froze in place.  I tried to contact the manufacturer without any success.  I purchased another type of sprinkler to finish the summer and I was quite disappointed by this product!
5.0,"Excellent quality, easy to adjust, trouble free.  Parts can be replaced if needed.  My last one served 15 years before I ran over it with the big tractor!"
5.0,"Great sprinkler.  You can almost set it and forget about the watering.  We do have it bog down occasionally, so we do have to check on it some.  I think if a person had an established, thick lawn you could start it and never worry about it bogging down.  We still love it."
5.0,Works great.  Set it and forget it.  Just what I wanted and arrived on time.  I first thought it wouldn't go over my rough yard but it does.
5.0,"We had one for 15 years, finally broke.  Just had to get another!  Highly recommend, but only get a Nelson!!!"
5.0,"If you don't have one of these, you should.  Watering the lawn is now much less time consuming.  They are absolutely worth the price.  My only complaint might be that It takes awhile to get it set ""just right"" and the settings are very minute.  But as soon as I got the hang of it, that became easy too."
5.0,Saves time moving sprinklers. Don't have to worry about different moves and shutting off. Recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to put in a sprinkler system and still wants to take care of gardens and lawns relatively easily. Don't know any product that does this.
4.0,Overall performance was very good.  We had to watch very carefully or too much water would be placed in some areas.
5.0,"I purchased the Gilmour sprayer after using several commonly-sold devices over the years. The Gilmour is sturdy, light-weight; it allows me to use any liquid with the appropriate mix-ratio quite easily and accurately.  I did have to search for a conversion table to equate tbsp/teaspoons into oz, which was easily found with a Google search.  All in all I'm very pleased with this sprayer!  And buying through Amazon made my search & purchase a real breeze...I find I am counting more & more on Amazon!"
1.0,"The water mixes with and dilutes the chemical.. It messes up the concentration.. Instead of wasting the chemical like the other bad sprayers, it dilutes the chemical with water from the hose.."
1.0,"Go ahead, dial their customer service and listen to the busy signal all day, no mater what department. I have wasted three hours trying to get anyone to answer the customer service line."
5.0,This sprayer is absolutely great! I sprayed my siding with bleach today and put weed spray in the yard. It works great and is easy to use. Highly recommend!!
5.0,I started buying the Gilmour hose nozzles.  DH was reminiscing that they reminded him of a great sprayer he had years ago.  It broke and he hasn't seen one like it since.  It would make spraying fruit trees in the spring  and aphids in the summer so easy.  Well I don't know if the thing works but anytime I can make dreams come true for this price I am on it!  The Mrs.
3.0,"I own a lot of Gilmour gardening products and did not hesitate buying this sprayer. However, the first day i got it and try squeezing the handle a few times - nothing hard, just normal squeeze - and the little red knob that holds the handle in popped right out. I pushed it back in but it popped back out after a few squeeze. I know they have lifetime warranty but it shouldn't be this bad in the first place. Other than that, the whole thing seems well made"
4.0,"I have only just received and used this sprayer once, but it is so far superior to the only slightly cheaper Ortho model that I have used and replaced three times that I was compelled to write a review.  I don't know when I've been so satisfied with the way something works, just as intended.  And it's made in the U.S.A!  And they offer replacement parts!  And the price is perfectly reasonable!  I just hope it lasts as long as it looks like it will."
4.0,The only thing I wish it could do better is the metering dial could go past 10 to allow even more chemical other than that it works great.
5.0,"Five stars because the nozzle works exactly like I hoped. The only downer is that the nozzle concentration setting is somewhat hard to turn, making you have to grab it with both hands. The only catch is that the brass has lead in it, and the warning says do not touch it. Something that is near impossible if you are changing the setting a lot."
5.0,This one is made in the USA and is the same price as cheaper Chinese made models.  Good quality and it is dsurable!
5.0,Great product and seller. Would purchase again.
5.0,"Very happy with this. Great price and solid sturdy product. I am new to gardening (I used to be able to kill a cactus (you know how hard THAT is LOL).
I have just planted a bunch of plants in a mulch bed next to the front of our house and a ton of potted plants around our deck. These are very comfy in my hand and easy to use. Super sharp and do the job great."
5.0,Excellent tool.  Sturdy construction.  Durable (cutting surfaces maintain edge) and performs as advertised.
5.0,"Best bang for the buck, these last a long time."
5.0,"Great for trimming bushes and such. Good quality, plenty sharp, seems like they will last"
5.0,Perfect for tending to my veggie garden.
5.0,I love these pruning shears as I knew I would. I have NEVER been disappointed with any of the Fiskar products I have purchased. They are a reliable company who makes quality gardening tools. I have small hands but am able to use them comfortably. My husband's hands are large and he is also able to use them comfortably. No complaints whatsoever.
5.0,"Very good product. I have used them multiple times, and they are still sharp, and work very well."
4.0,Even the kids can use without destroying my plants. Great product.
5.0,Work well!
2.0,"Although Solo sells a replacement pressure pump for the 425 and 475 backpack sprayers, this part is not replaceable even by someone with above average skills and experience. The repair shops refuse to work on these sprayers or want to charge more than a new sprayer costs.  A good sprayer, but not repairable except for easily accessed o-rings and washers.  Sorry Solo.  I need something for the long haul."
5.0,"I live in the country & have 2 acres.  I spray weeds, bushes, wasp, etc.  In the past it got old spraying for 2 minutes then stop & pump for 1 minute.  This is the best sprayer I've ever had.  Works very fluent and doesn't take a lot of pumping like the traditional non back pack sprayers. I sprayed 2 houses & 4 storage rooms effortlessly and within minutes. It has the power, durable, good pressure, & range (distance & width). I have fallen in love (shhh don't tell my wife). Great investment worth every penny.  As long as you flush your system with water after each use this sprayer will last several years in comparison to buying a new cheaper one every few years.  It pays for itself."
4.0,"I use this sprayer for an orchid collection on my screened patio. I spray fertilizer, insecticides and fungicides with it. It is a huge step up from my old hand held pump sprayer. I would never go back. I like the fact that I can mix up to 4 gallons so I'm not constantly running out of product. It is incredibly easy to use. I'm 6' tall and pretty strong, I think a smaller person may have trouble getting a full sprayer on their back because it's heavy. Also the shoulder straps may be too wide apart for a smaller person. Having said that, I've been using it for about a year and I recommend it."
5.0,I have used it twice. seems to do the job. No leaks. pumps great. easy cleanout. And at 4 gals I can get a lot done before I have to go and fill it back up.
4.0,"Solo 425.  The sprayer works great.  The harness falls off my shoulders.  I would have expected something to prevent this such as a chest strap.  I read in the instruction manual that it came with a lumbar support.  It didn't.

1.0,"This is a very over priced, poor performing product. If I had not used it I would return it for a refund."
4.0,"2008: I bought the solo 425 for organic spraying of pests in my garden. It works great except for one small problem. The backpack straps that came with my solo had straight clips on them that fell off when the sprayer was full. A quick call to SOLO, informed me that the straight clips were crap and they sent me a new pair of redesigned straps right away. Great product great service from solo. I bought this model because a neighbor had one he had been using for 10 years!!! I hope mine lasts that long. Note: The 425 has a piston pump (for liquid additives), the 475 has a diaphragm pump for powdered and / or liquid additives. Make sure you get the one that you need. The only reason the pump did not get 5 stars was my strap problem.

2015 Update:
Almost 7 years later and the pump still works well. The new strap design that Solo sent me have not been an issue at all, they just work. I use an organic copper mix for my peaches and an organic powder for the grapes, and neither has given me any clogging. I rinse the unit well after each use and unscrew the tip to facilitate faster flushing of the wand. So far it has held up really really well. I am very glad I bought it."
4.0,"Do not buy from this vendor. Package arrived without the deflector, which makes the product useless. Package was not sealed. Proceed at your own risck. Total wast of time and money.

Update: amazon was very helpful and cross-shiped a replacement product right away. They paid return shipping, but I had to run the package to the Post Office and they have closed the one near me.

After recieving and using a complete version of this hose-end sprayer, I will say it is a very good product and works very well. In the end it was worth the hassel."
5.0,We mix our bug control for our lawn in this sprayer. Works great. The brass fittings make the unit keep working and working.  Many of the box stores products break after one time. We only wish it came in a quart container also. Thanks for selling this item.
5.0,"This is the second one my husband has gotten. He says they last a long time, sprays really well  plus he has never found one anywhere that is as good as this sprayer."
5.0,"Comes with hose gun, very good quality. A lot better than the other all plastic sprayers.  I use it to spray vinegar on my synthetic grass."
2.0,Not a good product as it leaks everywhere. Not much more to say it was not usuable as it would leak water and chemical from the top spout.
5.0,"With the fact that the chemical doesn't get diluted until it is about to be sprayed out the nozzle I love this sprayer, no more expensive pest control. Just pull out this sprayer after getting the appropriate chemical and run around the house spraying the eve's and the foundation and around each window. No more pumping the standard sprayer type setup."
5.0,"I've been a professional gardener for 10 years and this is my go-to sprayer. Overall, it's a great product -- however, you do have to learn to  use it correctly. And you do need to have the water pressure recommended by the manufacturer.

As the directions say, the sprayer works best when the chemical concentrate is the consistency of water. The instruction booklet includes directions for premixing.

It's also important to clean the sprayer after each use.

I recall when I first started using the 362, it took me a while to feel comfortable with the different settings and mixing rates. Finally, I decided to simply set the dial on 10 and fill the bottle with the amount of chemical needed for 3 gallons of finished spray.

Using this premix rate, it's possible to spray the wettable powder, Pentathlon, a fungicide.

As some have noted, the sprayer does have certain flaws -- the spray diffuser is too easy to lose, the bottle opening is too small, the bottle is easy to tip over.

Knowing these things about the sprayer, I'm careful to secure the unit so it doesn't tip over. I've put a wire through the hole in the diffuser and attached it to the handle of the sprayer. I have a funnel to make filling the bottle easier.

OTOH, I what I like about this sprayer (power, versatility, capacity, light weight and ease of use) far outweigh the sprayer's quirks."
5.0,This item works very well. I have tried two other brands from the local store and both had all plastic parts. The Gilmour has some brass nozzle parts which do not leak as the other two brands. Also the other two products had to go back to the local store because they failed to work after two applications to my yard.  This is a great product and I endorse you selling it with five points out of five.  Thanks for selling this item. Delivery was as sited and the package arrived in good condition.
4.0,"An excellent sprayer that allows 10 different mix concentrations without diluting your concentrate. Didn't use it all? Just return leftover to the original container. Another nice feature is wide spray and heavy stream; this lets you reach second story walls with soap solution (and bleach) to kill mold. It is important to clean the unit well after each use, otherwise the filter screen will clog. The only reason it didn't get five stars is the on/off valve triggered by the handle. After about 2 years of use it starts to leak at the seal (only fresh water leaks out) and can't be diassembled for repair. Still a great product."
5.0,"I used this sprayer to kill about 3500 square feet of lawn and  weeds so as to put in new sod. It worked well and was much, much better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roundup-190260-2-Gallon-Premium-Lawn-Garden-Sprayer-With-3-Nozzle-System/dp/B002YNSAKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roundup 190260 2-Gallon Premium Lawn & Garden Sprayer With 3-Nozzle System</a>. The latter was a total waste of money as it would never pump out a sufficient spray with any of the three nozzles despite multiple cleanings. But I digress.

I found the Gilmour easy to use once I figured out how to adjust the thumbwheel dial it has sitting on top of the brass mixing head to the right amount of tablespoons per gallon (Doh!). (It also measures in teaspoons, if that's what you need, by removal of the brass screw at the top of the mixing head and placement of it on the top of the siphon tube.) One small drawback is that from 1-7 on the thumbwheel, you can feel the dial fall into place as each number is reached; between 7 and 10, however, there are no settings for 8 and 9, so you go straight to 10. If you need a dilution of 8 or 9, apparently you will not get that rate of dilution, as the company tells you not to set the thumbwheel between numbers.

One thing I had not noticed, though I've since seen that it is mentioned, is that there is a 10-tablespoon-per-gallon limit to the concentration of liquid applied to gallon of water diluting it. In the case of RoundUp concentrate the recommended dilution is 12 tablespoons per gallon. I took a chance and decided to spray longer over the recommended area so as to make up for the less-than-perfect rate of dilution of the concentrate. This seems to have panned out in my case as yellowing grass and weeds are everywhere after I sprayed, but this might not work in all circumstances. So be aware of the dilution you need before purchasing this sprayer. (It may be that more concentrated and therefore thicker liquids are problematic for mixing or spraying, so this is not necessarily a knock on this product.)

As to the quality of the product, it seems solid to me, with the exception of the usual plastic parts. The only one that I am a little concerned about is the plastic deflector placed where the spray exits the brass nozzle as it sticks out from the nozzle and so seems more prone to break if used carelessly.

Overall, a very good product. I would recommend it unless your use requires a substantially thicker, more concentrated spray."
5.0,"Finally, a nozzle the kids can't destroy!!"
2.0,"This leaks so badly, no wonder there's no pressure with it. I should've known better...you get what you pay for!"
5.0,cheap for the price!
5.0,Good enough to last a season.
5.0,Way better quality and price than the usual plastic ones that end up seeping water through the cracks. This one is way worth buying.
1.0,I put this sprayer (brand new never been used) on my garden hose yesterday and it began spraying as soon as I turned on the water. I figured it just need to have the adjust nut on the back of the plunger shaft. Much to my dismay the adjusting nut had be removed on the new version of this spray so there is NO ADJUSTING NUT on the shaft. That caused me to have to turn the water off to stop the water from spraying out of the nozzle even when the lever handle was fully in the off position. I can't believe Gilmour has stopped putting an ajusting nut on the back of the shaft. This sprayer is going back and I will not be buying anymore of these until Gilmour puts the adjusting nut back on their product. To Gimour: Put your customer first not the China part that cost less.. t doesn't work but you sell it for as much and more than the old style that worked great; and that is what I thought I was getting. To customers: If it doesn't have and adjusting nut on the rear to waste your time with it and don't listen to the hired Gilmour commercial comments that are just a marketing ploy to suck you in a get you to buy it.
5.0,Best ones for the money
5.0,Gilmour products are superior to most others.  Works great!
5.0,"Very good tool, thank you"
5.0,good
5.0,Fiskars is a great company and a great set of shears. Like the lock on it and handles
5.0,"Good little hand shears, very sharp."
1.0,Cheaply made. Handles slide off easily.
3.0,rusted after first use
4.0,Work''s great for me.
5.0,they work well. nice and sharp
4.0,they are good but don't open all the way for some reason
5.0,Work great!
5.0,great for the small jobs
5.0,They work as advertised.
3.0,"Bought this to use with my fish emulsion fertilizer. Since I realized the liquid was too thick, diluted it 50% and doubled the application rate like the instructions stated. The unit would not use up the solution I made even at the 10 setting. Put fresh water in the tank and it used the liquid up quickly. Guess will just have to dilute further or use a different fertilizer, a little disappointed. If anyone could recommend a natural water soluble fertilizer that works with this unit I would appreciate the help."
5.0,I used it to get rid of weeds and Poison Ivy in my backyard. It worked well and seemed to measure the herbicide evenly.
5.0,"This worked as described and is made very well.  However, I have never owned a sprayer before so I don't have much to compare it to.  I LOVE that fact that it is metal and not plastic.  Make sure you clean it after every use and I am sure it will last awhile."
4.0,Much sturdier and more accurate than the Ortho sprayer I had previously; only reason it is not 5-star is the bottle's opening is small so I have to use a funnel to put the liquid weed-killer/herbicide in the bottle.
5.0,"Use this for spraying weeds in the yard, as opposed to the 2 gallon tank sprayer I had.  I can't believe I lugged the tank sprayer around for several years.  I sprayed the yard in easily a quarter of the time or less, and didn't get tired of carrying it either.

Also, when done, I just poured the weed killer back in the original bottle, so no more wondering what to do with the unused weed killer."
3.0,"It sprays well if held slightly downward.  However, if tilted at steeper angles toward the ground, it does not mix the chemicals and sprays water only.  This became evident when I sprayed round up to kill weeds.  After a few days, it was clear that only the midfield areas were properly sprayed but the edges, where I had to tilt to avoid spraying good grass, it did nothing but spraying water."
5.0,"This thing is so much better than other sprayers of this type. It was worth the couple days wait to get it in the mail since neither Home Depot nor Lowe's had it.

If you take the black plastic tip off, it will shoot a good 30 feet or so. When I discovered that...I was happily spraying my trees like crazy.

Enjoy!"
1.0,"Before reading my review, it's possible that I stumbled upon a defective unit. I don't know. However:
1) Bayer, the manufacturer of the solution I use to spray my roses, recommends a dilution of 1.5 tablespoons per gallon of water. I filled in 1/5 bottle with the solution, set the dial between 1-2 and stated spraying. After some time, I noticed that the solution in the battle remains at the same level.
2) Then I read that you are not supposed to set the dial between numbers! That's a big drawback in regard to accuracy of spraying, especially at higher dilutions.
3) Next, I set it to #2 and again, the solution remained inside the bottle. That's when I realized that you cannot tilt the bottle when there is only little solution inside, since the draw pipe doesn't come in contact with the solution.
4) In order to achieve a dilution closer to what Bayer recommends, I had to set the dial to #5, which doesn't make any sense.
5) I will return it, since it may simply be a defective unit, or it isn't meant for high dilutions.

P.S. I just discovered another possible source for the malfunction: low water pressure. The unit is recommended between 40-60 psi and our water may be at lower pressure. All in all this sprayer has too many limitations for accurate application of spraying solution to individual plants."
5.0,"I've had several plastic hose end sprayers from the Home Improvement stores.  I went to buy one of the Ortho tree sprayers, but they discontinued that model.  I ordered this one, and it is much better than any of the plastic hose end sprayers at the Home Improvement stores.  Easy to use, just pour in full strength chemical, turn the dial to the number of tablespoons (or teaspoons) per gallon, then spray.  When done, pour the left over back into the original container.  Much easier than the other cheap plastic ones that you have to pre-mix.  The valve is all brass, the hose sprayer is a high quality zinc coated sprayer.  No leaks and no clogs.  I used it to spray several 25-30 foot tall palm trees.  Then put the black plastic tip on and sprayed several 10 foot trees.  This really moves product quickly.  Gets the work done quickly.  I love this sprayer.  Don't settle for the cheap plastic ones at the Home Improvement store, get this one!"
5.0,Have used these sprayers for years and they are excellent. Could not find them locally so was very pleased to find them on the web. Amazon and the supplier did an excellent job!
5.0,It was just what we were looking for to water our yard.  We looked at several brands and decided this would be the best one.
5.0,"The hose connector to this sprinkler is a bit problematic as others have pointed out - it is oddly placed which makes it hard to take off and reattach the hose, and it leaks a bit so I never just set this and leave the house for a long period of time. The stopper mechanism does work well so it will turn off but if I leave it for a long time I'll end up with a bit of a puddle.

That being said I still love this thing as an alternative to installing a sprinkler system. Nothing else we've tried is as low maintenance. All other types of sprinklers need to be moved around the yard multiple times resulting in a huge pain. Our yard is oddly shaped so I do have to turn it off and move it once but it is still much easier than anything else.

I have actually been using it on a newly seeded yard and it does churn up some mud and has gotten stuck a couple of times but waters the area very well and the grass is growing. If you are using in an area with any dirt or delicate plants you need to be careful about turning the arms to point lower to cover a smaller area - the water pressure coming out can spew dirt or flatten delicate flowers. Turning down the water pressure isn't a solution for this as that will slow the sprinkler down to the point that it will over water, get bogged down and stop moving. Maybe on really established grass that won't be a problem - I'll have to wait and see.

Still I give it 5 stars for being the ONLY watering solution that I can actually live with without getting fed up. The sprinkler is very sturdy and yes, as others said, a bit mesmerizing to watch."
5.0,"Everyone wants one now that they have seen mine.  Best sprinkler I have ever had the joy of using, awesome."
5.0,This sprinkler works great! Very sturdy and soundly made. Love watching it go around the yard. It is worth the money.
5.0,"I did not water my lawn because I hated moving the sprinkler and hose all of the time.  With this product, you set the hose in the pattern want the sprinkler to travel, hook the sprinkler to the end of the hose, turn on the water and walk away.  Very simple and easy.  I have had no issues with the sprinler and like the ruggedness and quality of the construction."
5.0,"Got this for my dad.  He loves it.  Surprised at the heavy weight of this cast-iron sprinkler, but it follows the hose and waters the lawn, and that's the point.  Satisfied!"
5.0,This bad boy can be set up and turned on and you can walk away from it as it will travel the path you set and water everything along the way.
4.0,"Ok, just got this baby today and tested it out.  Maybe someone commented in older reviews but I didn't see the following notes in the newer ones.  What I discovered is the following:

It does turn off after going over the ""hump"" but you need to have the hose continue going straight at least as long as the tractor is or it will fall over. AND you have to have the hose tightly screwed on to the tractor or the water will leak out the connnection once it is ""off"".

It uses a LOT of water.  It will give a good thorough soak but at the expense of a very long time and lots of water.  So not a good everyday watering tool.

It is SLOW - when people mention hours, they were not kidding.  But again, you get a good soaking.

I've done a yard at a minor angle and it worked fine.

If you need to water an area that is irregular you will be fiddling with it for a while.

Lastly, if you have a shorter hose you can stop it mid way and pull the hose through from the already done part the tractor is dragging to get lots more space covered without having to set it up again."
2.0,Very good concept but lacks reliability.  One $20 replacement gear box lasts at most a month. Not like they were with the metal gears.
5.0,"I had used my sister's about 4 years ago.and really liked how it worked.  I still think it is the best traveling sprinkler I have used.  I do like the feature that it will turn off when using the stop mechanism.  I thought it would just stop the forward direction, but it actually stops the water supply. This works great for me.  This is a heavy duty sprinkler and I it should last many years..  The wheels on my sisters were metal  and not hard plastic, but they seem to handle the job just fine."
5.0,"We've used this in the garden & backyard a couple of times now. It'll easily cut through most things you'd find in a garden and some light brush. It'll even cut through stalks that are a few millimeters thick. All and all, it is a nice product."
5.0,wife loves it
5.0,These are very easy to use and is surprisingly sharp. I've used it to cut inch thick branches so far and it cut through them like nothing.
5.0,i like fiskars shears in general. i use these pruning shears to clean my garlic. they work good.
5.0,Use this to trim the branches on my young tree. Sharp and cuts the branches with ease.
4.0,Seems well built for household gardening
5.0,Great product.  Fiskars is always dependable.
5.0,great
2.0,"This pruning shear does an alright job cutting smaller branches and the like, but the build quality is pretty dismal.

The rubber grips on these shears are held in place by... well nothing, they aren't ""held"" anywhere. After seeing limited use I had to retire these due to being unusable without the grips that refused to stay in place for longer than a couple of snips. The (orange) safety lock on this set is also pretty difficult to toggle compared to other Fiskars offerings with more premium construction.

I would highly recommend the Fiskars PowerGear pruning shears over these as they have: an over-molded plastic/rubber grip that can not slip, a much easier safety toggle switch instead of the goofy pin on this model, a more ergonomic handle design that is less of a straight line."
5.0,"Good pruning shears, sharp blades, handle fits snugly in my hand.  Good all around trimming shears."
5.0,Perfect.  My husband loves this thing.
5.0,just the one I've been looking for
4.0,it works.
5.0,"Pretty much what I expected. It's not full metal and is made in China (CHINA CHINA CHINA!), but serves its purpose and operates standard as expected."
5.0,"Great price, great product, well built, allows for control of pressure/stream easily - have tried a number of these more modern hose nozzles/newer designs, to me this is still the standard for others to aspire to."
4.0,Ok
4.0,Works ok with well water sources.
4.0,nice
5.0,"You can buy much more expensive / fancier nozzles but this works great! It's very durable, all metal and operation is flawless. Excellent value!!"
5.0,Nice hose sprayer. Works well.
5.0,"I have a $300.00 electric rig to spray my two dozen fruit and nut trees. Since I got this sprayer I seldom use the electric sprayer. I was upset to learn that the Ortho tree sprayer was no longer available, but this sprayer is better. It works every time, it is easy to clean, and it it is built to last. It is really a quality product."
5.0,I might as well sell my pressure washer ! This works great for washing the siding on my house. It will shoot the 30 feet that it claims and it cut the time in half to clean my house. I've bought 3 more and given them as gifts. You will not be dissapointed with this product.
5.0,I had one of these years ago but lost it. I really like the convenience of not having to measure and mix. You can put the chemical full strength into the bottle and just set the number of teaspoon measures or tablespoon measure and simply squeeze the trigger. Nothing to it.
5.0,"Best and easiest . Quality made. No mixing . Pour in concentrate, set dial and it does the rest.
Can remove tip , good for 30 ft distance."
5.0,It looks bigger in the picture but this little sprayer packs a big punch. As you know sprayers that shoot a stream any distance are hard to come by.  My coconut trees took a beating from excessive cold this past winter.  I needed to shoot copper fungicide 25-30 ft up. The Gilmour did it in stride with an accurate mix of the required dosage.  Very nice quality - the neighbors won't be borrowing this.
1.0,"Unfortunately this product did not live up to its claim of easy use.  After repeated failed attempts, I gave up trying to use it.  First, the spray stream was weak, not the distance or impact claimed by the seller.  Secondly, the unit failed to draw up the chemical I was attempting to spray.  I was bummed."
4.0,"Instead of pesticides, we use the sprayer to clean our kennels with disinfectants. We leave the disinfectants in the bottles even though it says to rinse after each use. The sprayer is well built and durable. The sprayer dial is convenient to adjust the flow of the disinfectant/pesticide. Only a couple minor issues I have with the product is the opening on the reservoir is small. A funnel will probably be needed in order to not spill any disinfectant/pesticide. The other minor issue is that we use very hot water to clean our kennel. The handle of the sprayer is metal so the water heats the handle and makes it hard to hold on too. I imagine most of the time the water used will be cold so this would probably not be an issue. I would rather have a well built handle than a cheap plastic on though so if need be, gloves can be worn."
5.0,"I have used other sprayers of the same design, and they have worked well over long periods.  The key is rinsing them out when done.

I have only used this product a couple of times, but it seems to get the job done well.  It puts out 3 to 5 times the flow of spray as a typical pressurized tank sprayer so keep that in mind when you are planning your spraying job.

One suggestion would be if you are to use just a small amount of spray, then dilute the spray concentrate with water 3x and use three times the application rate.  Check the instructions.

One option to rinse the unit, though you need to be sure you don't get any of the chemicals on you, is (1) remove the jar from the sprayer, (2)remove the fan spray head attachment, (3)turn on the water and let it spray in a direction that will not hurt or injure anything.
Let it suck air through the suction tube for 10-20 second and then put your finger tightly over the spray nozzle.  This will force water backwards through the suction tube, rinsing it out.  Be sure to wash up with soap and water afterwards to insure you don't get any of the residual spray chemicals on you."
5.0,"While I have used the sppayer only once, it worked very well.  I needed the spray to reach to the second storey of my house and it did that just fine."
5.0,"I have two of these sprayers...I use one for weed control and one for
fertilizer.  They are the 'best', when it comes to spraying easily on
a small or larger area.  I live in the Southwest deseret and keep the
weeds in check, on five acres, with this sprayer...definately would
recommend it!"
4.0,"I had trouble with the original sprinkler, but Nelson was prompt with a solution. The sprinkler works as advertised now."
5.0,"It is great.  I really am pleased with it, just turn it on and then don't worry about it.  My grass is greener since I have been using it.  I am very happy with it."
4.0,My puppy even chases it across the yard trying to antagonize it. Great for straight lines and those that done want to invest in an in ground sprinkler system.
5.0,I've always wanted one of these since I was a kid and now I have one and love it.  Works great.
4.0,"Seems to work really well. Set up a little involved with laying out the hose, but waters lawn really well."
5.0,"I love this sprinkler!  The arms adjust to sprinkle fairly narrow areas, maybe less than 20 feet wide.  It is slow moving even on the high speed.  It doesn't take sharp turns well.  It also ""jumps"" off the track sometimes, but don't sit there and watch it to see how/when it happens, but I have caught walking over in the neighbors yard before.  Also, when it approaches the ramp to turn off, it doesn't always make it up the ramp to turn off.  It just gets stuck there watering forever if unsupervised. But every other manual sprinkler requires constant supervision, this takes the constant moving the sprinkler out of the mix.  Is a great sprinkler to use in the wind as well.  Plus who doesn't love a walking tractor sprinkler!"
5.0,"This is a very good product.  I have a large area to water and this product covers the are without me having to move the sprinkler.  I check pretty often to make sure it hasn't gone off track, but the happens very seldom."
3.0,"There are so many positive reviews here, I won't bother extolling this unit's many virtues. But I'll point out some pitfalls that have caused frustration, so you can decide for yourself if they outweigh all the good:

1) If you like to keep your grass long, use with care.  The traveling sprinkler's auto shut-off ""knob"" underneath is easily fooled by hose that's not lying almost completely flat. Good luck if you have the slightest bump in your soil. When I lay the hose (which already is a nice, heavy rubber hose, 5/8"" diameter), I have to walk along it to push it down and get it flat through the leaves of grass. Otherwise the sprinkler turns off prematurely. I look like I'm failing a sobriety test whenever I ""walk the hose"" across my lawn. (Why so long? Well, I abide by all serious lawn husbandry advice, which tells us ""the tallest setting on your mower is not quite tall enough."" In the middle of a dry summer, my lawn is much greener than my neighbors'.)

2) Position the shut-off ramp carefully according to directions. A couple of times my sprinkler somehow escaped the shut-off and rammed the fence!

3) Do some curls in the gym before attempting a one-handed carry. This sucker is heavy, as it needs to be. But the cut-out handle is uncomfortable and if you are carrying this with one hand, it's not exactly easy.

4) Don't believe the finish is ""heavy duty"" or ""rustproof."" Maybe mine was painted just before lunchbreak in some foreign factory. It looks like someone gave it a very, very light spray of paint, not completely coating the underside (which is where it will get and stay wettest) and not impressing anyone. After a few months I have light rust forming. So, as another reviewer said, you  may want to hit this thing with a can of Derusto paint.

5) Go slow. Water delivery at ""high"" speed is almost insignificant. Light watering encourages grass roots to develop at the surface, and not deep like they should. 1"" of water per week is the recommendation. Use slow speed and maybe repeat.

6) Do have fun, though. This thing is like a Lionel train for grown-ups. It's sad, but this is the most fun a married, middle-aged guy will have over the course of his summer.  ;-)"
5.0,I wanted the heavy cast iron tractor sprinkler like my dad had but all i could find was ones with plastic bodies. Very happy to find this NELSON tractor sprinkler and to know that not everything is made of plastic
4.0,"Our other traveling sprinkler did not last this one seems a lot sturdier , it is great for big yards.easy set up and waters a large area"
2.0,"Purchased new, item poorly made.  Leaked after initial use somewhere near where the tank and cord/ piping.  I would not recommend purchase.  It is not worth the price paid."
5.0,"Light weight, reliable performance makes this a useful tool"
5.0,"Works like a charm! Does what it's supposed to. Nothing fancy or exotic, just a good solid sprayer that works."
2.0,"I guess it works fine, the handle sticks out quite a ways, which it  makes it impossible to store, because you can't fold it up. The straps are disappointing. The wand is hard to reach again if you set it down (hope you have very long arms). And it leaks weed killer onto my shoulders. Kind of disappointed with it for the price. My advice is to spend a little more and get a good one."
5.0,This sprayer is the best I love the quality
4.0,Pretty good sprayer. The only issue is that the bottom clips that hold the shoulder straps fall off easily and without warning. I taped mine with duct tape.
5.0,Great sprayer had its earlier model for 20 years till a kid broke it.
5.0,GOOD PRODUCT
3.0,"It works ok, but every single one of these I've used (a dozen or more, at a prairie restoration operation) always has a leaky sprayer valve. Evrery. Single. One. You will always be dribbling fluid from the wand, the valve always gets fouled and will never fully shut off. If you like disassebling and cleaning a sprayer valve with poison liquids all over your hands, this sprayer is for you."
5.0,Love it. I use it every week
5.0,"Wonderful product, fast transaction"
5.0,Work great! I've had other pruning shears that would pinch your hand. These do not. Very sharp. They've cut through everything I've tried.
1.0,"I've always used Fiskars but these shears didn't work for me. Mechanism for lock is defective. On another note for those with small hands, this is a pretty large pair of shears. My hand is 16cm from wrist to middle finger and width from thumb to pinky is 9cm when my fingers are positioned like a karate chop (all fingers including thumb are adducted). I ended up getting a Fiskars bypass pruner with coil from a local HD. It's heavy duty enough for most hand pruning around my garden. Looks almost the same as this one but slimmer and lock mechanism works."
5.0,"I kid you not, this tool is one sharp machine. I absolutely love it and have used it so much since i got it!!"
5.0,"I wish I would have found these years ago. These are the shears to use on any plant/shrub/tree up to 3/4"" diameter. I have an assortment of expensive pruning tools from anvil type to bypass and this one set of shears replaces them all for a fraction of the price.

Extremely sharp top edge will cut even the finest blade of grass but they do not know the difference between plants and skin, so if you are careful, they will serve you well. I really like the fail safe locking slider that prevents them from opening accidentally. The grips are nicely padded and just the right size.

I have smaller weak hands and these seem to fully open just to the right place so that I can clip rather quickly without the need of shifting my grip. I can cut for extended periods without my hand tiring.

They are pretty much maintenance free except I always wipe mine off then give them a quick spray of wd-40 just to protect the metal blade. Wipe off the excess and put them back in the reusable package until my next chore."
5.0,These shears are a real good fit and cut through most plants.
5.0,would buy again .. good value for money
5.0,Awesome!
2.0,"Had many reviews most of them good. When I got mine I tried to cut a small soft branch and it just bent instead of cutting. I can see the blade is not lined up with the metal part causing a gap instead of slicing through. I now see other reviewers having the same issue, either the blade overlaps the metal or its too far apart. I was really hoping these would be decent despite the cheap price but they are just cheap. I'm sure they are not all made with these flaws so you'll have to decide on taking that chance. The metal on mine had a lot of nicks and scratches too."
5.0,Great lil pair of snips.. no complaints.
5.0,works great!
3.0,"This is a China made, grey, plastic coated, ""full metal"" nozzle. They don't leak (so far) & are old school style. Don't pay too much for this basic model."
5.0,"Pros: Doesn't overcomplicate what should be simple. Sturdy. Good seal. Easy to use. Great price!

Cons: Honestly, none."
5.0,"I bought an expensive spray nozzle for $15.00 at the same time I bought this one for $4.28 and although the expensive one looks very nice, it has no power, this Gilmore sprays with much better force and is very easy to control a wide spray to jet burst simply by pressing the handle! I have not had it for very long but so I far I love this simple yet powerful spray nozzle!"
1.0,Failed the first time I used it.
4.0,So far so good no leaks seems solid
5.0,"i use this hose nozzle to hand wash my car (daily driver) when i don't need to use my gilmour foamaster. the all exterior metal is tough enough for exterior use and it actually feels comfortable in the hand when spraying. with the front screw on thread, rear tension clip for the handle, it's a great bargain.

the best part of the nozzle is that you can adjust the water pattern from a gentle mist to a heavy jet spray in less then milliseconds. there are heavier duty nozzles especially built to last dropping onto pavement but at this price, ergonomics and features it's a great buy."
4.0,"This was purchased to replace one just like it.  The problem with these is that the wire loop which is used to lock the trigger on falls off after some use.  This doesn't prevent use, but makes draining the hose difficult once it comes off and disappears.  In fact this is the third Gilmour hose trigger I've purchased in a row.  The first had a different mechanism for keeping the trigger on and lasted for many years before falling apart.  The last one lasted a few months due to the loop falling off and this one was just placed in service so I cannot tell how long it will  hold up.  The loop is just into some indented places on each side and not all the way through for a solid fit.  The quality has gone downhill over the years (what's new, huh?).  I don't remember where this was made.  Perhaps red China.  Not sure but not as good as the ones I owned in the past.  I thought the name would ensure quality.  I often wonder what will happen to all the companies that reduce quality to make profit.  You would think that their name would be important to them.  Anyhow I am using it for now and if it repeats what the previous one did I will find a different brand for future purchases."
5.0,Simple is good.
5.0,no complaints. I've had it for a few months now and have used it a few times now. No rust or any weird things like that. has held up nicely being outside 24/7.
1.0,"I used this sprayer exactly twice.  The third time the pump did not work.  Could not take it apart to see what was wrong.  Total waste of money.  Am in need of another, so will try another brand."
4.0,"Made the mistake of rebuilding a Solo.....royal pain in the backside, plus over half the cost of new for the parts.  This time ( many years life out of these), bought new."
3.0,"I bought 2. One had all the parts, but one was missing the bolts that secure the hand lever to the pump...so I don't yet know if it works or not. Requires a trip to the hardware store...:("
1.0,What a rip. The one I received is a Solo knock-off. Leaks like crazy. Every fastener was loose and still leaks after tightening. If It doesn't have the  flag on it send it back. Ended up buying one from Home Depot for $75.
5.0,You will like this sprayer much more than the comparable Echo sprayer...Easier to handle and the hand pump is much better...Holds pressure better too...I've owned both and the Solo 425 is the way to go...!!
1.0,"Received this product with the shut off valve on the handle broken, and had to buy another replacement handle. Doesn't seem like a reliable sprayer."
5.0,"This backpack sprayer worked very well. I was very pleased with it, no complaints."
5.0,Works  great  had one similar to it and dropped it and broke the pump but it was 20 years
1.0,"The solo sprayer I purchased leaked profusely right out of the box.  The one thing I didn't need was something else to work on.  The shoulder straps keep slipping off while I was  trying to spray.  If your looking for a project or want to be drenched with poison while your new sprayer is slipping to the ground, this sprayer might be for you."
2.0,"When I opened the box up I found it was missing some of it's parts .Shame on me for not checking it when I got it. I assumed it was all there. Unfortunately, the return time had expired by the time I went to use it."
5.0,"A long time ago my parents owned a raintrain. It was a fascinating thing to my brother and I and we enjoyed playing with it, and eventually were trusted with setting it up on its long trek through the backyard. To be sure, we probably contributed to its eventual demise, but it took a lot of punishment before it went down and now I've completed the circle with my own. Comes well-secured with no damage to the item and good instructions on how NOT to break it as my brother and I had done. And, as I hoped, it does the job admirably. If you've a large yard or one that is long and windy, this is a good product to look into. Especially with the auto-stop feature they've come up with."
5.0,This is certainly for LARGE areas! unless your lawn is very big I would question the need for this. But it does work well
5.0,"I ordered this sprinkler for my dad who lives in an assisted living center, but still maintains his permanent home.  How wonderful for me to order this product from a state away from my dad and have it delivered in days to him.  The whole process worked perfect!!

By the way, this is his second Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler, at 89 he knows a good thing."
5.0,"I really like the Nelson traveling sprinkler. I have a big yard and it takes quite a while to water it. If you're not normally patient, you'll have to develop patience because this sprinkler doesn't get in a hurry."
4.0,"Okay, after the experience I just had, I had to come write a review.

I've had this traveling tractor sprinkler for about 3 months now.  I love how it ""tracks"" with the hose. However, there is 1 slight problem.  If the tractor encounters a turn(a turn it normally makes with no problem when starting out and the length of hose it's pulling is short), while pulling a long section of hose, it will derail.

Well tonight I connected the sprinkler and off it went.  Well naturally, I forgot about it until about 3 hours later.  I ran outside and sure enough, it got derailed but get this.  It was stopped by some plastic landscape edging next to our house.  The sprinkler arms were still spinning, which meant the wheels were still turning.  It literally dug a 3 or 4 inch hole in the ground.  I was worried the gears would have been broken at this point, but I put it back on it's track, Turned the water on and off it went, with no apparent damage.  Tragedy avoided.  Love this tractor.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because of the derailing part but other than that, it's great to be able to set this thing up and nearly forget about it."
4.0,I do manage to use it but it is not like the old one which I had had for 35 years.  The thing I do not like about it is the fact that your yard must be level with no bumps in it.  If this one hits a bump it shuts itself off.  I even called the company and ask if there was some way I could tear it out and they told me no.  So it is o.k. but not as good as the old one!
5.0,"I got this one for a friend, and another one for myself. Solid construction and works wonderful (don't forget to read the directions first). It's like a functional train set that waters your yard at the same time. Also saves water when correctly using the auto shutoff feature. No more swampy yard or excessive water bills for me.
I wish they had a whole bunch of different colors to choose from."
4.0,Very substantial construction.  This is not a cheaply made product.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it seems to go noticeably slower as it starts to drag more hose behind it.  I almost always drag up the excess hose before it's reached its final destination and I can see it speed up as I do that.  I probably do that every 20 or 25 feet of travel.  Still a lot less hassle than moving both hose and sprinkler around and hope you got adequate coverage.
5.0,"Not only does it look great, this sprinkler is solidly built with great watering versatility.  It follows virtually any path you lay out regardless of grade or grass height.  I painted my green when I received it"
4.0,"The tractor works pretty good however, it needs to be oiled pretty frequently or it squeaks.  It does get a good water spread and it is very convenient for watering a large area"
1.0,"The straps on this backpacked can never fit a full grown man . I am six feet 6 260lbs , couldn't even get an arm in this thing."
5.0,"Good quality Back pack sprayer, and pretty easy to service. Solo has all service items available for purchase if need be."
3.0,I work at a farm were I use this thing all the time for 5+ hours a day and all I can say is it causes a lot of pain. Iwould recommend buying the shoulder saver harness cause I hear that makes it not as painful but I have yet to purchase one. Only buy if you plan to use occasionally for less that two and a half hours or if you plan on upgrading the straps. Also make sure you use the filter and check and clean the filter on the tip before and after you use the sprayer and you should be all good.
3.0,After a few uses the sprayer wan't stop spraying completely once pressurized.  It drips spray where I don't want it.
1.0,"THE STRAPS NEEDS TO BE LONGER FOR A PERSON TO GET IT ON MY SIZE IS 60"" I HAVE WIDE SHOULDERS SO THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME"
4.0,"It works well, and I left off the 5th star only because the straps don't have a chest-level cross-latch.  Some might find this picky, but when you have 4 gallons of chemicals on your back, that weight tends to pull the backpack off your shoulders.  As a 5'3"" tall woman with good upper body strength, it adds stress to my back.  My solution was to hand-fashion a cross latch with Velcro and nylon strap.  Problem solved

Otherwise, It works like a charm.
+ I like the fact that the gallon measurements are in raised in the plastic itself.  It won't wear off!
+ The pump is easy to work, and I find that as I walk & spray, its easy to keep the pressure for continuous spraying.
+ It has a nice screen / filter at the opening.  Just unscrew the top, fill with chemical(s), replace the screen/ filter, fill it with water from the hose, and you're good-to-go.  Sometimes there's debris in water lines, and the screen/filter is the same heavy duty material found in the backpack itself to prevent those particles entering your water reservoir and, subsequently, clog the tube system .
+ I really like the base, designed to keep it upright, even on uneven surfaces.  Since I'm short, I can set it on a trash can, add chemicals and water, and just step into the straps and hoist it onto my shoulders, without stressing my back (by lifting it from the ground up to my shoulders).
 ... .The base keeps it steady, even when I'm not graceful in hoisting it onto my back!

I've been using it for about 3 months now, and it's so easy, and I don't get tired (as I did with the smaller, hand held type sprayers), so I find I use it much more often, and the weeds don't get ahead of me.
I would buy it again, for sure.
Hope this helps --- Leslie in East Tennessee"
2.0,"If you buy any Solo sprayer, you should also stock up on pump rebuild kits and be ready to spend an hour or so installing one every year from now through eternity. We bought one a few years ago, it lasted one season, then a different model (piston) and that lasted one season. The rebuild kits run $15-22 each. Seriously, either have one on hand or be ready to have your pump not work when you need it. They are fairly easy to take apart if you are handy with a hex driver & screwdriver... but they really need to use better quality rubber or silicone so they will last longer. But then they won't make so much profit on the rebuild kits!"
5.0,Perfect
2.0,"Spraying is great....  I just can't get over the leak if any pressure is in the tank.  The whole time I walk around the yard spraying weeds in Flower beds, driveway, mailbox... etc....  I have drip/drops falling on the back of my ankles.  I have learned to set it down after spraying outside on the patio to get the remaining pressure out so it can finish leaking.  I know I am not supposed to leave liquid in it.... I usually spray once...  then wait a week and hit the spots I miss (Then clean it).  Long story short, I should have asked for a new one sooner but I missed the time allotted. I am currently looking for something that doesn't drip on my ankles as I walk around spraying weeds.  (I was going to buy a second one for fertilizer...  Won't be this model)"
5.0,This item made short work of a job that used to take hours with a 2 gallon hand sprayer
5.0,I thought boring looking metal hose nozzles like this always leaked horrifically.  Apparently not.  This thing is cheap and so far has been completely leak proof.  Nice even and controllable spray as well.
5.0,OLD FASHION NOZZLE
5.0,worked fine for the price.  I needed for control of burn piles.  worked fine
5.0,Nothing beats this simple sprayer!
4.0,It works. Is metal so it will hopefully last longer than the plastic ones.
4.0,"Works as described.  Have only used it twice so far, with no issues.  Simple.  Does the job."
5.0,"never thought i'd be thrilled to be using a nozzle - i mean, come on! it's a hose nozzle! - but this is comfortable to use, feels solid, has an intuitive design, and frankly, i've been sharing the link to this product with all friends who have yards. i LOVE this thing! i found it on thesweethome.com where it comes with glowing recommendations. i've been trying to buy good quality things that last and this one fits the bill and at a super low price!"
5.0,An excellent tool.
5.0,Great product and excellent price.
5.0,Works perfectly.
5.0,"Works well, easy to use."
2.0,I prefer the Pruning Shears with a spring between handles. These are not for me.
5.0,This tool works as expected.  I use it to shape bushes and cut tough weeds  Nicely made.
5.0,Wish I had bought these years ago!
5.0,Love the Friskers trimmer. Works very well and easy to use. Has a safety lock to keep the blades closed. A great product from a great company.
1.0,They won't stay closed making it super dangerous for my little kids
5.0,Awesome quality!
2.0,Cheap
5.0,Good stuff.
5.0,Sharp.
4.0,"It's great sprinkler but I would like to know why one of the arms will pop off.
Sometimes is it cause I don't have it tighten properly. Any one knows comment please!"
5.0,"This sprinkler is great, I setup the hose in the area I want to sprinkle, and forget about it for 3-4 hours, and the lawn is done! I highly recommend this"
5.0,"I bought the Raintrain (hereinafter referred to as the RT) at a local hardware store although I could of saved a few bucks if bought through Amazon.

My underground sprinkler system is hooked to a well that has gone dry and drilling deeper is in the thousands of dollars range so I decided to hand water, at least for this summer.  Hand watering is a pain especially when the little woman keeps telling a guy to ""move the sprinkler.""  Thus the RT.

PROS: Works as advertised.  The transmission has three settings, one for normal travel, one for slow travel and a neutral, just sits there.  I always use the slow setting thus getting more water on the lawn.  The water wands are adjustable so you can set for a tight circle of sprinkling or a large circle that will just about cover my entire front lawn with a single pass.  The RT follows my hose track with the front divided wheel over the hose and the back drive wheels a straddle.  It will turn no problem as long as the hose track is not to tight of a radius, about 8 to 10 feet.  The RT comes with a little yellow ramp.  The purpose of this device is to turn the machine off.  The RT runs over the ramp and high centers itself on a push valve on the bottom of the tractor body and shuts off, works fine.
The torque provided to the drive wheels is remarkable.  If the RT runs into a rock or some other immovable object  the wheels will keep on turning gouging deep ruts into your lawn over time.  It will pull 150  ft of three-quqrter inch hose or 200 ft of five-eights.  I have three-quarter for my back yard and five-eights for the front.  It might be my imagination but I think it runs a tad better with the five-eights being an eighth of an inch smaller diameter thus providing a bit more water pressure but then of course I am losing volume so as I said... could be imagination.

CONS:  The RT is heavy (out of necessity I suppose) about 22lbs.  So when moving with a water filled hose attached it becomes a bit unwieldily.  WEAK POINTS:  The transmission gears are made of plastic or nylon or a combination of both.  It would be nice if they were made of brass however that would probably double the cost.  In any event it is best when moving the RT to make sure the transmission is set to NEUTRAL.thus avoiding the chance of stripping the gears.  Some reviewers have complained of this happening to their machines.  As I figure it the transmission works as follows... The ""T"" section, that part to which the water wands are attached, spins a worm gear that engages one of two main gears.  The larger of the two will make the RT move slower while the smaller gear will make it move ""normally"" which is the faster of the two settings.  As stated I always set it to ""slow"" in order to put more water on the lawn.  The most tender of the parts on the RT is the water wands which are made of light aluminum.  The machine has a very narrow wheel base so when you flip it up to pull out the stop valve it easily turns over.  This could damage one of the wands if you are not careful.  Last point under the con section.  If your lawn has a steep grade it would be best to set the hose track so the machine travels down slope consequently not putting extra heavy pressure on the transmission gears.

WARNING TO MEN:  We guys have a ""gadget gene"" so when it comes to things that has flashing lights, goes beep, whir, or ding ding we become hopelessly entranced.  The Raintrain drills down and tickles that gene like a son-of-gun.  So instead of setting the RT and going off to do something productive we have the tendency to watch it as it travels almost imperceptibly across the lawn... Soooo when you turn it on don't look at it.  I am telling you will get hooked if you do.

Have fun with a little care your Raintrain should last a long, long time."
5.0,This sprinkler is wonderful for big yards that are too expensive for installing automatic sprinklers.  You do not have to move sprinklers around to get every area - this thing does it for you.  Works great.
5.0,You need a Raintrain it's so easy to set up .............Done sit back with a glass of wine and not worry about moving and Sprinklers
5.0,Hubby loves it because he doesn't have to go out and move the sprinkler.  We also like the shut-off feature.  Only wish it would move a little faster because of the draught water rationing.
5.0,Best sprinkler on the market. Worth the money water coverage is better than most. I would recommend this product to my friends
5.0,I'd recommend this product to anyone with a large rectangular area needing watering.  It's a little top heavy and some planning is needed to make it effective on hilly terrain.
5.0,Bought this to replace my John Deere tractor sprinkler that recently died.  I have been pleasantly surprised at how nicely this works.  So far it is quiet and smooth - shut off works flawlessly.  Especially appreciate the cut out they hon the front of the sprinkler to carry it around.  It's very heavy and this makes it much easier to move it - especially when it's wet.
5.0,"""Honey I bought a tractor""... probably the only time I will get to say this about a purchase and the reaction was worth it as was this little gem.  I have a big yard and we have struggled to water it properly.  We have a well and every time I run a regular sprinkler it really stresses the well and pump plus I have to move it around all the time.  This little tractor is so easy.  Connect it to the hose.  Twist the little water heads for the area of coverage, put the little brake on the hose where you want it to shut off, lay out the hose for the pattern you want and put the tractor on it then go turn on the water.  There are two forward speeds (no reverse!) so set it to slow for a good soak and leave it to do its job.  I even set it and forget it at night since it turns itself off. Love it."
4.0,Works great so far. I keep fingers crossed. Very heavy.
1.0,"Love the product. I have three. This unit does not operate.
Simply does not work. It would have been a Chalenge to return so it is still sitting in my garage."
5.0,"Easy to operate pump handle because it's comfortably engineered to fit my arm length.  I'm average height, but has enough play in pumping action to handle shorter or taller people.  That's not usually covered in the description, but this one is great.  Hose is right length and positioned to easily grab it after you've slung the tank onto your back.  Side benefit - there's plenty of white surface area to personally mark with permanent markers the chemical fill levels for various spraying jobs. Powerful:  You can reach at least 40' high (our tallest tree) with spray on a calm day.  It's the second Solo sprayer I've had and totally wore the first one out.  Everything continued to work on the old one without part replacements, even with age.  Ended up giving it to my son.  I did annually put a little vaseline on the lid gasket to keep the pressure constant and the gasket pliable.  It's a little expensive, but its' reliability makes it worth it, especially after you get the heavy pack situated on your back and you get to comfortably spray instead of taking it off to fix something.  Wish Solo made other products - smart engineers doing practical stuff."
5.0,great product
4.0,Works great.
5.0,Husband very very satisfied with purchase
1.0,"This will leak at the house and ring attachment. Also, the straps are poor of quality and function. Looking for something better."
1.0,"I purchased this product to allow me to water in remote areas when planting food plots. After a weekend worth of use, the wand continues to leak even on the locked position. Of course the return period just expired 4 days ago and I am left with a faulty product. With zero pressure, the leak allowed almost two gallons of water of escape through the wand. The only way I can stop the leaking at this point is to elevate the wand with the end pointing up or purge the tank dry."
1.0,"Sprayer arrived and after assembling it and filling it with liquid, it pumped 3 or 4 times and locked up. Nothing came from the pressure cylinder to the hose. Called Solo and they couldn't help so I have to send it back, having to wait for them to figure out what is going on with it. They did send a UPS label to have it sent to them. I am wondering if it was a return that was not properly checked out.

Considering it was not working properly out  of the box, one would think Solo would send out a replacement once they received my return. This process took a couple weeks."
5.0,love it ...i will never own a 1 gallon sprayer again
5.0,Great for watering large flat expanses. Set it and forget it and the whole lawn is watered without any fuss.
4.0,These sprinklers do a great job of evenly watering my lawn.  It is great to be able to set it and let it go.
5.0,"this is the best traveling sprinkler.  I have one other and it is about 9 years old. These are the best way to water your
lawn"
2.0,"I ordered this sprinkler with high hopes because I have a huge lawn, no sprinkler system, and it just isn't possible to water with conventional ""move-around"" hose-end sprinklers.  I got it to work (make sure you get the sprinkler arms in exactly the right position!). The sprinkler itself is quite heavy, metal, but - the cheap plastic end-ramp (that the sprinkler is supposed to climb onto & shut itself off) is absolutely useless.  Why Nelson thought a light-weight plastic fixture with an inadequate short rod to anchor it into the ground would be acceptable and work is beyond me! I've tried a number of times to make this work, with only one success... I have a LARGE rural lawn - it's not a golf course! - but it should be acceptable for this to negotiate.  (I recently bought a new hose - a Tuff-Guard Extra Flexible, Kink Proof Garden Hose - and the traveling sprinkler can't follow it at all, but gets hung up on the hose ridges.) - This thing will probably live in the garage until I donate it, sell it, or give it away... I'm going to check out other brands..."
4.0,"This is a must have, if you are watering large areas.  Be careful about setting up the circuit.  If you get any area too wet, the wheels will spin and you will end up with a mud puddle.  You need to stay on top of it to make sure it covers the area that you want and doesn't get hung up."
3.0,"This sprinkler seemed to be a perfect fit for what I needed but unfortunately I had to return it.

I have about 4500 square feet of grass including backyard and my yard is someone weird shaped, so I figured this sprinkler would work well for me.

My first complain is its very slow so I am unable to track how much water this is really consuming. I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.

Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.

Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.

Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lol

Overall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase"
5.0,I have owned traveling sprinkler but it was to old to get parts and I wanted another. Amzon had the best with price along with free shiping. With a traveling sprinkler I like the idea of setting it up and let it water my entire lawn with having to watch and move and knowing that it will shut off when finishted.
5.0,I've owned of number of these and this one works great! Stops when its suppose to and rides the hose very well.
5.0,"Set it and forget it!  No watching or moving it; it just follows the hose and shuts off when it reaches the 'speed bump'.
I set it up before going to play golf and when I return my whole lawn has been watered."
1.0,"After repeated failures with the competing Orbit traveling sprinkler I decided to try the Nelson. Alas, aside from the color and shape of the metal housing, it is identical with the exact same problems.

The gears inside are cheap plastic, that, after a short time will inevitably wear out and strip. You'll hear the fatal 'click click click' and your traveling sprinkler will forever be stationary. Other failures include extremely slow motion as if the water is barely flowing through. Sure, occasionally the bottom 'stop' button will accidentally trigger, or a spray arm will come shooting off, but that's OK. It's the fatal failures which make this product a real loser.

At first they are just fantastic, I can lay them out and let them go (I use a two hour timer to stop them as you cannot completely trust the ramp/button method). I think, perhaps, with very minimal use, these would be a fine product, but for intense watering like I need they are simply too cheap to trust. I have two left currently working and as these two die, I will use the few I have in the shop to cannibalize to keep them going to get me through the season. Next year I will have to rely solely on the tripod impact sprinklers.

Until Nelson makes a 'pro' model with metal gears, I would stay away from this product."
5.0,This thing works great.
4.0,works like a charm https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N6BW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
5.0,Good price and really does the job easily!
3.0,best price around by far but leaked and returning for another one being sent.  leaked and got chemical on my lower back
1.0,"Sorry Solo, I sent it back and ordered a Chapin. Junk versus quality."
5.0,Works outstandin!!!!
4.0,My husband has several of these.  He has one for whatever he is spraying.  That way he does not have to wash them out-- etc.
5.0,Exactly what I needed to help at the farm.
5.0,We used this to spray 120 feet of 6 foot privacy fence with stain. Front and back of the panels. Worked great. It did get clogged a couple times but I chalked that up to it being 100 outside and me being slow. Great product
5.0,Love it
5.0,Great
5.0,"Solid, no leaks."
5.0,"This is the hose nozzle I've always valued.  Not the most expensive, but works well and lasts."
5.0,"Great hose nozzle.  Usually last 3 to 5 years if you keep it oiled every year.  Dangerous if you drop it on the ground though, it will wet you up."
5.0,All good!
1.0,The base of the sprayer broken off after two usage. It is not a zinc at all but plastic with a very light metal coating.
5.0,"heavy duty, last a lifetime. May need extra washer to seal."
1.0,Made in China. Junk. Junk.
5.0,squirt.. ha ha  old solid hose end sprayer that works
4.0,"Nice product, but tends to loosen overtime"
5.0,these work well and have held up.
5.0,These are great shears that make pruning bushes and trees very easy.  I lost my first one so I just had to purchase another one because I love them so much.
5.0,Love these shears!
5.0,Very useful & cut well.
5.0,"THE BEST, HAVE 4 PAIR, THEY NEVER WEAR OUT OR GET DULL. AMAZING."
5.0,Good quality
5.0,"Great product, I keep a can of spray lube / protector handy to use after each use, to prevent corrosion (I sweat a LOT in the heat here). but these are great and a better buy than than I find around the local area."
4.0,"Wonderful, useful for trimming bushes."
5.0,Great shears that don't wear out your hands.
5.0,"Heavy duty, durable clippers. Essential for working in the garden! I would purchase these again."
1.0,"It will work for a short time, but the plastic gears will quickly fail.  Mine lasted less than a month and I never pulled more than 100 feet of hose with it.  The replacement gear box will cost you about $30 to replace.  Spend the extra money up front to get one that will never wear out - the National Walking Sprinkler."
5.0,i love this sprinkler as i can start it and it just continues on.  very rarely jumps the hose sometimes just have to make sure the hose turns gradually and there are no problems
5.0,"I bought this to replace an older model that was on its last ""wheels."" If anything, the newest incarnation is even better than the old one. These things just plain work. My lot is over an acre and my neighbors constantly comment about what a nice lawn I have. Not having to worry about setting timers and moving sprinklers all over the place is a true blessing!"
3.0,Powerful and good product. If you drag more than 30 feet of hose behind it the thing jumps off the hose guide on the front wheel
1.0,It lasted about 3 months till plastic drive gear broke. Don't waste your money on this. The gears need to be made out of metal.
1.0,"The idea is great, the execution by this manufacturer is lousy.  Had one of these 50 years ago that worked great; that was before designs were cheapened down.

This unit has a heavy cast iron body with a plastic gear box.  The weight means the plastic spike wheels get excellent traction.  The water pressure through the rotating arms provide the power geared down to reaching the wheels.  Water pressures vary from 40-100psi; mine is 60psi at the tractor.

The jets at the end of rotating arms at 60psi generate torque this is geared down through a set of plastic gears to the wheels.  My unit encountered various type of obstacles causing it to slow down anor stop.  The max force is felt at the final gear set and was too much for the plastic teeth to handle.  Instead to stopping the rotating arms, it proceeded to damage and ultimately break of gear teeth.  Perhaps with a golf-course prestine absolutely flat lawn and no kid/pet toys it would work fine.  The unit my family had 50 years ago was made with metal gears able to take any abuse a lawn could issue.

Lawns require an inch of water per week and this one in low speed provided 3/4"" while taking ALL DAY to cover its max 200' hose length.  My lawn required four days on three off; what a hassle!  The water flow is rather low while it did cover a wide path nicely.

I only used it a few times; just enough to get past the 30 day warrantee.  Being so excruciating slow and with its major construction flaw, I highly recommend no one purchase these units unless from an antique dealer."
5.0,"It's fun to watch singing ""do do do looking out my back door,"" so long as the tangerines and elephants don't trip over it."
5.0,"Been looking for one of these to give our deprived grass and plants some relief from the heat and lack of rain.  They love it, I love it and the price was wonderful as well.  Cost a bit much to ship, but it is sooo worth it, very heavy and well built."
5.0,"Waters the lawn evenly, and you can set and forget it.  I should have bought this years ago. Can't wait to water the lawn again"
3.0,The tractor seems alright but that auto shut off is the dumbest idea anyone has ever come up with. I was able to defeat the ignorance with a hose clamp but I'm sure in a few years its going to be a problem.
5.0,Heavy for a petite woman to carry when full.
5.0,"Have three of these sprayers. I am 5.2 so they fit nicely and i can carry half full of solution.  I use solo because of easemofmuse and availability of replacement parts. One sprayer is 10 yrs old still going. Replace,ents have been very small,oarts which i manged to loose.."
5.0,Just what I wanted
4.0,"I like this backpack sprayer because it's just easier to make up a 3 or 4 gallon load of spray and move around our hilly property with it on my back. It's much less work than carrying a 1 or 2 gallon sprayer in one hand or on one shoulder. Having the ability to fill this with 4 gallons at a time makes the job take a little less time and that's helpful too. I didn't pay attention when I ordered and I bought this piston style this time, whereas in the past we've always bought the diaphragm style. I am not sure that I perceive a real difference in use, although they look different and there are separate instructions for each in the Solo manual. This piston backpack worked fine. I am 5'8"" tall and almost 70 years old and the weight and distribution were acceptable. The rod or bar that is used to pressurize the spray is at a convenient location at the side and was easy enough to pump. The spray handle itself gave me some trouble and soon became stuck in the constant-spray position because the plastic was soft and got wedged into the little groove. That isn't good, so I knocked off a star. The spray pattern is OK. I usually use fairly large drops because it seems we always have at least a little wind and I don't want the overspray going everywhere. Not a bad sprayer, although it needs a much better spray wand."
4.0,"This is so much easier to use than the kind that requires you to carry it in one hand while using the sprayer with the other. It does a great job spraying just plain water in a fine spray which is what I needed it to do. The harness is a little fiddly getting it on but once you get it on it's not too uncomfortable. I do wish there was a strap across the chest to keep it from falling off my shoulders. I had to rig something up to prevent that, so the harness could use some more attention. It's a little bigger than I needed but it still works great. It's easy to pump and the nozzle is easy to use with an easy pull trigger which is easy on my arthritic hands. I'm really glad I got it."
5.0,"I just tried it for the first time and it works so much better than the common garden-variety sprayer. It delivers a very powerful stream, up to about 20 feet, with just a few quick pumps. After dispensing the full 3 gallons, my shoulders felt fine. My pumping arm was getting fatigued by the end but not severely. It seems to be a quality device but only time will tell."
1.0,"4/18 - revised to one star. It ended up leaking so bad i gave it away. Its garbage.
**********

I really wanted to like this sprayer a lot more than I ended up liking it. I have a yard that is good sized for Silicon Valley (I'm sure folks in other parts of the country would laugh at that). It's about 13k square feet. Normally, to go around spraying pesticide or weed killer, I have to re-load my 1.5 gallon hand pump sprayer a couple of times. Not only that, I have to carry that sprayer in one hand while the other holds the spray wand, all while occasionally pausing to set the sprayer down and pump the sprayer up and then pick it up again. So, I thought that with a ""professional"" sprayer of 4 gallon capacity, I could load up the sprayer a little over half way, walk around while spraying continuously and be done much faster and easier. As it turns out, this is all true, except for that the sprayer leaks somewhere near the piston assembly on the bottom. It's hard for me to tell exactly where the leak is coming from. I tried tightening a couple of likely screws. I also looked for damage on the cylinder housing and adjacent areas. Nothing. I just get the occasional drip of weed killer on my calf and on the lower part my shirt. Ew.

So, I looked around where the leak might be coming from. I also tightened the screw that holds the pump cylinder housing. I have not been able to find the source of the leak just yet. Fortunately,  was spraying some fairly mild weed killer, so I was able to press on and finish spraying the weeded areas as well as applying the rest of the ~3 gallons I mixed up. What I found is that the sprayer is surprisingly comfortable to carry, the pump works well other than the fact that it leaks, and that I do actually get the yard sprayed more efficiently with this backpack than with my old hand sprayer. That said, my old sprayer is 20 years old, and does not leak.

I haven't called the manufacturer for assistance yet. I think I'll t take another shot at stopping the leak and then call them. In the meantime, I am taking two stars off for leaking. If this big plastic wonder is meant for pros, then it is miscast because the pump housing area leaks and is likely too fragile. In fact, I'd rate it a two, except that it does actually spray really well while it is dripping poison on my shirt and leg."
5.0,"Perfect for our use, very well constructed"
2.0,"Top of sprayer where lid screws on is warped. Lid will screw down but if not careful it will be cross threaded and leak out top with full tank, Works great but for the price you shouldn't have them ship you something that obviously wasn't checked by QC before packing."
4.0,"We've used various sprayers over the years to waterproof our cedar fence, a job I never look forward to doing.
This year we went out armed with 3 sprayers between the three of us. The Solo 454 performed well, 2nd only to a professional model.
I started off with the Solo, and finished a section of fence which was 25 ft long x 6 ft high, on 2 sides. After which I rotated to the professional sprayer, which was going more quickly, and was lighter. This wouldn't be a problem for most people, but I have arthritis in my back and both knees, as well as some other issues that make walking or carrying things on my back for any distance difficult. Had this not been the case, I would have been fine.

The fence we were treating is 6 ft high, there are two 75 ft sections, and a 40 ft section. Double that, as it had to be treated on both sides. The last time we treated the fence it took three of us 3 full weekends to tackle the fence. At the time we were using relatively cheap pump sprayers, which each held 2.5 gallons.  This time, armed with the Solo sprayer, the professional sprayer, and another sprayer our daughter had left over from a painting internship, we finished in 2 relatively full days, but that included cleaning the fence, which took several hours.

I did find the harness awkward, as did my husband. The unit was pretty effortless to operate, especially when compared to the sprayers we used last time.  Cleaning the Solo sprayer was the easiest of all the sprayers we've used, requiring no more than a strong spray, and soap and water. Of course clean up will vary depending on what you are using. Our product was an organic, environmentally safe, and biodegradable product which we contained.

The Solo 425 is a good choice in sprayers, especially for larger area."
5.0,I'll probably never have to buy another one. Can't understate the importance of its all-metal construction. Works great with the Dramm 400 water breaker wand.
5.0,"""Old School"" design.  But great quality and why mess with a design that works?"
5.0,This is like the way they use to make them.
4.0,does the job.
5.0,"I like it: A good basic ""squirter."""
3.0,great tool
3.0,Works as described.
5.0,CAN'T BEAT A CLASSIC!
5.0,Great basic nozzle.!!
5.0,"Hard to find around where I live, its the only one I buy.  Puts out the spray patterns I need, takes all kinds of abuse around the house, and stands up to hard water."
5.0,"Great sprayer, which is normal for Solo!"
5.0,This is such an easy sprayer to use.  So much nicer than the ones a person has to pack around by hand.
5.0,"I love this sprayer!  I am used to using Stanley 61804 Professional Backpack Poly 4-Gallon Sprayer which works great, however, this thing works way better in my opinion.  When I mix up a batch of weed killer, I usualy need to use the whole fill when using the Stanley.  With the Solo one, I used a little more than half to cover the same area using what seemed like the same spray pattern.  So basically, I get better coverage with the Solo.  Also, it is very comfortable and I really like that the wand sits on the handle rather than on the back of the unit like the Stanley.  Overall, I highly recommend this sprayer if you are looking to get a backpack style sprayer."
5.0,"I have used a Solo Piston Backpack sprayer for over a year. It is a different model, but very similar to the Solo 425. It has been an excellent sprayer.
The Solo 425 has the a very short pumping stroke and reaches a good pressure very quickly. There are a few spraying patterns that can be used which include an adjustable nozzle which adjusts from a fine spray to a stream. This is the type of nozzle that I use for spraying my apple trees. The other nozzles include a jet stream which reaches out a long way, a flat spray and a hollow cone spray. The changing from one nozzle to another is only hampered by the size of the parts. They are very small and could easily be lost. I considered giving the unit four stars rather than five for this reason and one other feature. This is being very critical.
The pump handle on my other sprayer can be removed from its friction collar quickly for storage of the sprayer when not in use. The handle on this Solo 425 is bolted on so would be impractical to remove each time after use.
This unit sits up nicely for filling, the back-strap is easy to get on and is very comfortable. The unit is well balanced with the pump handle well placed and can be used either right or left handed.
The Solo 425 Deluxe has a regulator for air pressure control. This does not, and I could not really think of any reason to have this feature for my spraying needs.
Included with the unit directions is how to repair the air pump and the pump diaphragm. This part of the unit seems to be quite complicated and I hope to never have to do this. This would also be a slight concern for me.
The spray action and pumping works very well on this unit and as with all sprayers it should be rinsed out thoroughly when done spraying. I like the Solo sprayers and recommend them."
4.0,"Got this for the guy that takes care of our fence rows - yes we have those old fashioned stone rows that separate fields.  The weeds and vines make me crazy and in the old days they burned them off but no longer can we do this.  Anyway - he used this only once thus far and he likes everything about it.  He said it's a bit of a contraption to get on your back when it's loaded with liquid but once on and the weight is distributed evenly it's nice to be able to walk around the perimeter without returning for more liquid in the 1 gallon container we previously had.
As Fall approaches we'll use it more and I'll be back to update on it's working order over time."
5.0,"This is my 3rd 425 Solo Sprayer.  I keep them at rental properties I manage so I don't have to bring haul them around, as they are often full of liquid.

I have tried many sprayers through the years... and in general, back mount is my fav.  I also have the back mount solo battery sprayer...while it is nice to not have to pump, it adds a lot of weight, size and u always have to remember to charge it up.  Then, the batteries don't last forever... so if you use these for occasional home use, and your back is strong enough to suppor this weight, this pump model is by far the BEST unit to own.  I have not had one fail on me yet...and no one wants to mess with repairing an item like this.  I guess at some point, the seals will wear down, and I will have to replace them, not a big deal.  my oldest one is 4 yrs old.

I have used the carry cylinder sprayers...wears my fingers out holding all that weight... I have tried the ones on wheels... hard to always get it through areas, gets stuck on rocks... if your back can handle it, this is the way to go.

BEWARE... the only weak link with such a heavy device on your back...is getting it ON your back... these weigh about 50 lbs fully loaded...so chances of injury are greatest when u try to get the pack ON your back.  I find a ledge, about back height, and fill it there, then back myself up into the sprayer, and put my arms through shoulder straps.  quite simple.  OTOH, if you try to lift this off the ground onto your back, beware of injury.... of course, if you are 20 yrs old and a football lineman, well, this statement prob. doesn't apply, but to the general population, it DOES apply, so give this some thought...

The ergonomics is very good, the pump works very well, one hand pumps, the other hand sprays...its quite the work out.  But you can unload all 4 gallons in 20 minutes when going full bore, so not so long on your back.

If you use these a LOT, such as daily, u might want to consider buying better strap system, or add padding to this system...its fine for occassional use, but repeated use would benefit with better padding... u can buy many kinds of add on strap systems...although I never bought any, as I only use these once a week at the most.

the plastic holder is robust, the best of any sprayer I have ever used.  The cap is heavy duty, it has survived many drops without any issues.  wide mouth, easy fill.... Solo thought of everything and the price is very competitive with cheap imports...  kuods to Solo..."
5.0,"If you have never used a backpack sprayer you are in for a treat. That being said this model is an excellent model for the home owner. I can not comment for the pro's. I do know a pro that used this model and liked it. Me, I use it for my home and rental properties. I keep one loaded with round up and one with wet and forget."
4.0,"Here in the Vale of Doomed Attempts at Yardwork, we are suffering through 100 degree weather and also the aftereffects of a storm that knocked out power for a week and dumped tree limbs and other debris everywhere.  Now that we have (almost) finished cleaning up, we cannot help but notice that much of our lawn has died while we were cleaning up and that several of our trees look sick. (It's usually the sick trees that lose the limbs). So, once temperatures drop a bit I expect to be doing a lot of spraying to try and get things fixed up.  All our old hand sprayers have died or seized up. So this backpack sprayer will be a useful adjunct to the cheapo hose end sprayer that I also use.  The backpack sprayer should be less tiring than the hose end sprayer (no heavy hose to keep lugging around) and I should be less likely to get wet in the process.  Also, my hose end sprayer always dumps stuff in my face when I try to spray up into the trees. This sprayer should avoid that problem and should be able to spray higher into the trees.  If my results turn out not to meet my expectations I shall correct this review before September 1st."
5.0,Saw it being used at a Professional garden nursery.  Absolutely exceeded expectation. Revolutionary. Sooooo easy to use.  WHY have a not seen this in home improvement stores.
5.0,My husband loves it!  Much better stream than the cheaper ones!
2.0,"I have an old traveling sprinkler that has worked fine for years but does not have the automatic shutoff. I had hopes that this one could replace it and not require any tending while in operation. Sad to day this unit is only useful on a flat lawn. The aggressive wheels are plastic, causing the center of gravity to be so high that it often tips over when on our sloped lawn. In addition when the unit makes a turn the shutoff valve runs over the hose shutting the sprinkler off.

I've gone back to my old cast iron sprinkler and now use a timer if it needs unattended operation.
Save your money, there are better sprinklers on the market."
1.0,"Received the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nelson-1865-Raintrain-Traveling-Sprinkler/dp/B00002N6AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler</a>"" in april 2012 and used it for the 2012 summer. this summer I tried to use it and it sheared the plastic drive gear and is worthless. I had planned to look for a replacement gear box but now I'm going to get rid of this sprinkler completely and consider it lost money.  I previously had the old all metal sprinkler and thought that was what I was buying when I purchased this sprinkler.  A bad mistake on my part.  Don't buy this sprinkler."
5.0,This is just what I wanted.  Heavy duty sprinkler does the job it is supposed to do. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a great sprinkler.
4.0,"I have a big lot and this device really save me a lot of time on changing the watering locations on the lawn!  The device is solid and heavy.  Don't be alarmed when you first started because it looks like it is not moving at all!  Actually it moves very slow, even in high gear, but it covers the watering area well.  Read the instruction carefully when you assemble it!"
1.0,"I ordered this because I have a fairly large lawn & I thought I could set it & forget it.  Just let it move along & water the entire yard.  Boy was I wrong!  Both my front & back yards are on a slight incline so I have tried aiming the tractor across, down, up, but all without success.  I return after about fifteen minutes to find the thing on it's side & the spray arm either laying beside it or spraying into the air.  Even when it works for the  ten or fifteen minutes regardless of how I set it, I spray the street or driveway or the arms stop rotating, I would have continued to buy the cheap plastic sprayers for $10.00, at least they worked."
5.0,"I set this baby up, then me go grab a beer and watch me neighbors struggle in the Texas heat with a water hose and an inferior sprinkler.

By the time they are done I am on me second beer and they look like they pissed themselves.

Meanwhile me grass is perfectly being watered, along with me flowerbeds.

By the time me gets my 8th beer this baby shuts itself off automatically, because me never remember."
5.0,I bought this product because my husband had seen it somewhere and wanted one. It is easy to set up. You just lay your hose down where you want the tractor to follow and there you go. A couple of times the tractor has gone off the track or jumped the stopper but that was probably more our fault than the product. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to an alternative to installing a sprinkler system.
5.0,"I wish I had ordered this sprinkler years ago, it's heavy duty and is no problem to put together :-)"
5.0,I bought this to replace the one I had.  The old one lasted about 9 years or so and then the gears gave out and it would not pull.  I do not have a bing problem with curves they just cant be real sharp.  Great time saver in that you do not have to go out and move it around.  Hopefully this will hold up like the last one.
5.0,quick shipping. this little tractor works great for a big yard with no sprinkler system. kinda fun just watching it go
5.0,"Very strong, I cut tick branches that I thought I needed a saw to cut them"
5.0,Repeat purchaser of this brand. Every year I seem to need a new one because of one mishap in the garden or another. Lasts me for the whole season and then some. Makes nice clean cuts and is comfortable in the hand.
5.0,my husband has stolen them from me because they work so well!
4.0,"Work as expected, nice and sharp as well."
4.0,They work nicely so far.  I bought two.
5.0,Good item.  Works well.
5.0,I love these pruning shears. They are super sharp and easy to use. They made short work of branches in an overgrown hedge I was cutting down this morning. I am very pleased to have them and know they will make my life much easier when I tackle another out of control  hedge in my garden tomorrow.
5.0,Does the job.
2.0,"If you are going to be doing a yard's worth of pruning or intend to keep these around for a few years, I suggest you pass. Locking mechanism is crap. The two blades stopped meeting flush together after about 3 days of use. No longer usable."
5.0,Work great
1.0,"Have bought 3 of these recently, all developed leaks in the piston region within 10 to 30 uses.  Of course each time i as drenched in herbicide... thank you Solo or is it so-low.  Had used these for many years, used to get 2-3 years of really heavy use out of them, now less than a month."
5.0,solo good products have used them several yrs hold up well
5.0,"Great product great PRICE@ HD. I HAD A PROBLEM with the left side strap falling off. Here is the fix. Adjust the problem side first. Than get the pump on your shoulder. Tighten weak side more than the opposite side.this will give the clip an up tug.you may need someone to assist. Once on your  back ,make the proper adjustments to  both sides. The key is to adjust the straps. Also,to stop any leaks use plumber's tape at all screw on parts. Hope this helps."
5.0,I love it. I will not have a hand one again. Makes things easy and fast
5.0,Works as expected. I sprayed over 1000 seedlings with no problems.
5.0,"This is a rock solid product.  I wish the shoulder straps seemed sturdier with more padding, but they never failed.  I wore the pump out first - this is my second one of these.  The first unit lasted 6 years being used to spray fungicide on our vineyard. Buy one of these and you can quit your gym workout!"
5.0,"This one made spraying easy.  A professional landscaper recommended this, and I don't regret it.  I don't have to stop and pump it up every few minutes"
5.0,Worked as expected. Got tired of spending 20 dollars on the cheap ones every year.
1.0,"The straps are the cheapest and most ineffective straps I have ever had on a backpack sprayer--and I have had several good ones. The sprayer mechanism itself is fine, but if you have three gallons of herbicide on your shoulders and the straps let go, well, you know how much profanity can result.

Solo used to be a sound product years ago, but the plastic ""clamp on"" strap fixtures at the bottom and the astoundingly cheap plastic pins at the top are something Solo should be ashamed of. I cannot believe the crap that sells for $80. If you want to buy a good sprayer, perhaps Google search RelaxPack. Costs lots more, but at least the reservoir will remain attached to you and even be semi-comfortable. I have sprayed hundreds of gallons with other backpack sprayers and I NEVER had a strap detach before.

Nobody wants to dump 3 gallons of Glyphosate and 2,4-D to the ground because the straps are so poor and readily come undone. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this Solo sprayer."
2.0,"I'm giving up on this sprayer. The sprayer has always continued to stream herbicide at low pressure for 5-6 seconds after I released the trigger. Not ideal when spot spraying and I have to wait for the herbicide to stop streaming from the nozzle.

Recently, after a normal spray session, I discovered that my entire backside was covered in blue dye and herbicide. The tank had developed a leak that made it unusable. I purchased the repair kit and replaced all o-rings and seals. Still leaks.

I thought I was investing is a solid piece of equipment that would last years without problems. I was wrong. I'm glad so many have had success with theirs. I did not enjoy this sprayer."
4.0,"Works as promised and makes watering a large area easy (if you have a lot of hose). It is heavy and well made. Guess it has to be heavy to stay on track (your hose). One drawback is that if you are starting a yard or have bare spots, watch out. It goes right through the mud but does tear up the lawn in the bare spots, which will pull up the grass seed along with it and leave tracks without grass when it sprouts. Then again, it saves you from tracking through the mud to move the sprinkler."
4.0,"I have two of these sprinklers for our expansive rural yard.  I really like the ability to set a track with the hose and mostly leave it alone until it shuts itself off.  But....I just got in from replacing the drive motor in one of them and replacing a gear in the other one from a salvage motor (I have four of them on the shelf).  The gears in the motor are plastic and cannot be purchased separately, got to get the whole motor for $20.  I get about one season per drive motor.  Guess if I could find a like product with metal gearing I'd switch to it.  Until that time I just figure each sprinkler is going to cost me $20 to $30 per year in maintenance cost."
4.0,"I've put my Rain Train through almost a full year of service in my suburban 7500 sq. ft. lawn, and I've learned some of its ups and downs.

Other than an in-ground sprinkler system, I can't imagine a better way to water my lawn's irregularly-shaped areas.  I have a 130' x 12' swath that I've always found to be impossible to water with conventional sprinklers, and the sprinkler hoses that I've tried are less than worthless.  The Rain Train dutifully marches down this long and gentle decline, leaving me to relax with a tasty beverage instead of constantly relocating sprinklers.

I gave a 4-star review because it performs as advertised, and it does the job like no other sprinkler that I've owned.  The pile of dilapidated, broken, rotting plastic sprinklers in my garage speaks to my efforts to effectively water my lawn over the years.  The Rain Train is built like a tank, and weighs nearly half as much as one.

The missing star in my rating can be summed up by the following caveats:

- if this thing jumps the rail, it can be disastrous for your turf. It will keep going until it either hits an obstacle, runs out of hose slack, becomes weighed down by the length of hose that it's dragging behind it, or moves onto a surface where it doesn't get enough traction to keep moving (e.g. sidewalk, street).  In these cases, it will sit in place and dig...and dig...and dig, forming a wet, muddy hole wherever it is.  I recommend never leaving it unattended for long periods of time.  You simply can't assume that it will run the entire track as intended.  This lesson was hard-learned due to my own inattentiveness.

- If you have a bumpy lawn, it will tend to trigger the shutoff switch on the belly of the unit.  My turf is relatively uneven and it is not uncommon to check in on the Rain Train, only to find it dormant part-way down the track.

- If you are watering a newly-seeded lawn (which is why I bought it in the first place), the low orientation and high pressure of the water distribution will tend to wash away seed.  Even the areas that I had covered by peat moss were quickly washed away when I had the water nozzles pointed even remotely downward.

Honestly though, I would replace this in a heartbeat if it were stolen.  Hail to the thief that cares to lug this heavy hunk of metal off of my lawn though."
5.0,"VERY GOOD PRODUCT COVERS LOTS OF AREA , THIS IS THE 3RD RAINTRAIN SPRINKLE WE HAD IN 20 YEARS SO IT REALLY SEEM TO LAST."
5.0,"The thing works as intended.  I like being able to adjust the sprinkler arms, setting the spray patterns best suited to wind or area of coverage needed.  It is actually kind of fun to use and manage."
1.0,The gears on this things will strip out within a year of use. Buy the original National Walking Sprinkler. They are built like a tank and will last a lifetime. I cannot stress enough the quality difference between the two. Nelson uses cheap nylon gears and National is all-metal made in the U.S.A. Don't cheap out on this one. The cost difference is nothing when you compare 1 year of use with 60+ (no exaggeration - check other reviews) years of use.
5.0,"So much better thanthe ocilating sprinkler I have had, and the little sprinklers don't always cover.  This one covers it's tracks."
5.0,I bought one of these after doing much research and learning from others that this is the ONLY model that seems not to break down. They are a little expensive so I just bought one to see how it worked and if I was just wasting my money. We have a very large yard and my husband spends an entire day watering and moving sprinklers. Since we don't have the funds to put in a sprinkler system I thought we might try one of these to see how it works. Well we were pleasantly surprised and how well it worked that we bought two more and now can water the front and back and side yard at the same time and with the automatic shutoff we don't have to keep watching the clock and worrying about how long the water has been on. I have since shown it to several friends and they have all been happy with theirs too.
3.0,"This is a decent enough tractor sprinkler. It's able to handle up to 200 feet of hose before the weight of the hose is too great. It isn't the right choice for gardens or uneven lawns or tall thick grass. If the ground is uneven or the grass is too tall, it will push on the sensitive cutoff plunger on the bottom of the sprinkler. The plunger is made to cut off water when the sprinkler runs over the included ramp which fits on the hose. Even though our grass is mowed I have to occasionally restart my sprinkler because our yard is uneven and has thick knots of grass. I have to shut off the water, move the sprinkler ahead (away from the problem) and then turn the water back on. I bought this to replace our 22 year old Thompson train sprinkler which finally wore out, but never had the shutoff issue even though it had the same shut off feature. If you have a normal, even lawn and it's kept properly trimmed, this is a good sprinkler. It will throw water up to a 40 foot diameter circle. The diameter of throw can be adjusted by setting the angle of the swing horns.  In low gear it takes about 8 hours to move the 180 feet usable with 200 feet of hose and in high gear it will move the same distance in about 5 hours."
5.0,"Last night I brought out the Nelson 1865 for its first run. Oh my god, it is the most awesome thing ever. I love that you can customize how far the water reaches to accommodate different shapes of your lawn. Love that it moves on its own and you can determine how quickly it moves.  I normally have to move the sprinkler 8 times in order to cover my yard. Now I just move it from the front yard to the back yard so its so much simpler. It moves the water around well meaning you get full coverage of the entire area.  Its cool to watch too."
4.0,I had to replace the Viking 912600 8-Way Heavy Duty Spray Nozzle which rusted out with this one and it works great for less of a cost. Not quite as versatile as other fancy ones but gets the job done.
2.0,Mine broke after almost exactly 1 year of use.  And I was using it probably about once per month.  I was hoping that it would last longer.
5.0,will last longer than any other
5.0,Works beautifully! Much better than expected and it is STURDY!
5.0,"works as advertised, love it :)"
5.0,Everything about this purchase exceeded our expectations--thanks!
5.0,"This is much better than having to buy plastic nozzles over and over again (i leave mine outside attached to the hose year round). This nozzle is very durable, relatively easy to control once you figure it out, and can be left outside without worry of it breaking."
5.0,"Extremely well built.  The best one I have ever bought, really.
I've tried the ones from Craftsman, or ones from Wal-mart and I basically know they won't last more then a year, if even.
But this one is a tank!  You can just tell that its built well, from the way it feels when you squeeze the trigger to how the water
is released at the different steps of squeezing."
5.0,Works great so far!
4.0,A bit disappointed that this was made in China. Metal seems a bit cheap. Haven't used it too much yet but seems ok.
5.0,This product is great makes my job easier
5.0,This is about the tenth backpack sprayer I've had in my landscaping career and I'll continue to get them.
4.0,Works great
5.0,Great sprayer
5.0,Very easy to assemble and performs better than any of my other sprayers. Will buy more of these in the future.
3.0,"Not impressed with the straps, nice unit for the money but I rather spend more next time"
3.0,"I had the sprayer 2 years and it worked great. I have a problem because the pump went out. The  replacement part cost $38 and i have to put it in.  I think the pump should have lasted longer than 2 years. If its only last 2 years i,ll buy another brand  for $55 and  hope it lasts longer."
2.0," As others have pointed out, the straps are a joke. You'll never be able to keep them untangled or consistently connected to the sprayer.
 After about a year the wand connections leaked.
 I replaced the wand but the wand depressurizing mechanism would not engage--misaligned plastic.
 Shortly after that, the bottom of the tank leaked.

In any case I've moved on to a no-leak Smith sprayer."
5.0,Not much to say.  I have used one for twenty years and it was time to replace.  It is the gold standard of sprayers.
4.0,"I have used these before with no problem, but this one the top of the holding tank where the 4.5"" cap threads on is not flush and has a dip in it thus allowing it to leak when walking around."
4.0,This works good.  I did have it jump off the hose a couple of times.  I get tired of going out and moving the water all the time.  This product takes care of that.
5.0,This is my second Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler - my first on was knocked over by house painters and broken.  There was not a replacement park available for it.
5.0,"This little guy is amazing!  If you have a large area to water and don't want to keep moving the hose, I highly recommend this guy!
We have just put down 100's of sq. ft of sod and if not for this guy  - it would have died!  We plan to install an irrigation system,  but until then - we will being using this everyday!"
5.0,"works good so far, and waters the yard the right amount, very good buy, most garden shop charge over 95"
4.0,The 1865 did exactly as advertised.  I covers large areas and water well.  It is a little arkward and heavy to pick up for a woman.  Have not used it on rough or hilly area.  It follows hose well and go where you point it.  I would recommend it to a friend.
1.0,"So frustrating to pay this kind of money for such a hunk of junk. I only blame myself for being stupid enough to not read other stripped gear box reviews. Whats worse is its 30 bucks to replace the gear box... with another plastic gear box. Whats the point in that. Mine stripped within 4 weeks of use now its in the trash off to the landfill.
After doing some research National Brand Walking Sprinkler has made in the USA all metal geared sprinklers for not much more. I guess you get what you pay for. Thanks China and Cooperate Capitalism for filling up our landfills with plastic crap. What a waste, these used to be made with metal gears... FOR A REASON!"
4.0,"I have a  large 1 acre yard, so we had to buy 200' of hose.  I was skeptical, but it worked like a champ."
5.0,"This thing is awesome! After struggling with multiple sprinklers, buying new ones when they break (hard dirt on a new lawn) I finally bought this raintrain and saved my sanity.  I would say stick to areas of the lawn that are fully grass as it *can* get stuck in dirt/mud if its almost at the end of its travels and is pulling a lot of hose behind it, but again, most people that buy this have grass, not a mud pit..."
5.0,"I have a 1 acre yard and split up the watering over three nights (front, side, back).  The lawn is about 56 feet wide (100 feet or longer; back is the longest) in every 'zone'.  I adjusted the arms with a ruler (outlet on sprinkler arm is 2 7/8"" from nozzle to body measured at a perfect vertical).  I adjusted it once and never touched it again.
I used an in-lawn rain gauge and found that at slow speed it dropped ~5/8"" of water and dropped ~3/8"" of water at high speed settings.  I would water the lawn twice a week on slow speed when there was no rain for the week and once a week on high speed if we received ~1/2"" of rain during the week (have a professional rain gauge out in yard).  I feel this is a pretty good drop since a good oscillating sprinkler takes about 1 hour to drop ~3/4"" of water.
I have had my Raintrain for 5 years and it still works perfectly (no leaks, shut off is complete, arm rotation is steady and water comes out very evenly).  However, I do drain the water out AND I store it in the basement for the winter.  I live in central Massachusetts - winters can see temperatures go down to the teens often.
I actually put washers painted yellow in the lawn with roofing nails (bright orange cap) so I can lay the hose exactly where I need it.  From the road and even walking in the lawn, you can't see these ""markers"", you just have to have a good idea where they are situated.  This eliminates the guesswork on where to lay down the hose if I have a curve since the hose layout has been tried and tested.
I have the greenest lawn in the neighborhood even during hot weather (start the sprinkler at 7 PM; done by 3 AM; I am using 130' of hose on the largest area and generally on slow speed, ~18' per hour travel and this is dependent on the angle of the arms; the greater the throw, the slower the travel time BUT more water is dropped.
Bottom line, do a little extra work at the beginning and after a few trials and errors, you never have to adjust anything or guess where the hose goes every time.  I used to be an engineer - everything has to be exacting, repetitive, and easily duplicated once completed.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nelson-1865-Raintrain-Traveling-Sprinkler/dp/B00002N6AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler</a>"
5.0,It works very well and waters all of my lawn.  Great product.  I would recommend it. You can't go wrong.  Try it.
4.0,"I ;have a pair of these that I purchased locally and thought having a second pair would be good.  I was a little disappointed that the price difference was pretty much the same.  Aside from that, these are great gardening tools."
5.0,Shears work great. No issues.
5.0,they work good
1.0,"I'll be totally honest; I hate these shears.  I had a small little pair that I randomly bought at a hardware store a few years ago that I LOVED, but have no idea what brand they were.  When they disappeared in my garden somewhere, I turned to Amazon to help me pick a new pair.  The reviews on these shears were so overwhelmingly positive that I thought I couldn't go wrong.  Buuuuut, I hate them.  They're much larger than I expected, and for a person with small hands (which I have), that's a big deal.  The size I dislike, but I can get over.  It's their lack of cutting ability that's the real problem.  For as large as they are, they're not particularly sharp and have a hard time with woody or stringy vegetation, such as rose stalks or tall grasses.  When trying to cut a rose stalk (of average size - I'm not trying to cut anything for which long-handled pruners would be more appropriate), for example, the blades separate and veer away from each other so that they don't actually sever the stem, forcing me to stick both my arms into the base of my rose bush so that I can get both hands on the shears and force them closed.  Then, on the other end of the spectrum, with thinner materials, like reedy grasses or dead Birds of Paradise leaves, the blades aren't close enough together to make a clean cut - I usually have to grab the item with the shears, and then twist and yank repeatedly before muscling the leaf off the plant.  Definitely a substandard product."
5.0,great shears. cuts up to an inch thickness or so.
1.0,Should have listened to other reviews about the blades becoming nicked and bent to the point of being unusable after only small amount of use. Worthless.
5.0,"Makes cutting easier, works great. I bought two pieces and my job now is a pleasure. I recommend."
3.0,Latch mechanism not that smooth operating
5.0,Easy to use and to carry on hikes through the underbrush to ease the way.
5.0,Outstanding clippers
5.0,"I have used Solo Backpack sprayers for over 16 years as an employee of a local tree nursery.  That is why I purchased the 425 model for myself.  I've never had a problem using their sprayers.  If you use it enough to wear out any part they are easy to rebuild, or repair.  It is my professional opinion that Solo is the best tool for spraying anything from insecticide to deck stains.  Lightweight and bulletproof, it works great right out of the box, or, you can customize the Solo sprayers with a variety of small improvements.

I purchase from Amazon, and am thankful for the great service and quick shipping that I received."
5.0,Works great
5.0,Quality back pack sprayers are so expensive now but they last! 5 years ago I got a similar  one for 50$. They're a necessity if you use round up every year or need to spray difficult places you can't reach with a trailor/ boom sprayer ( behind a ATV).
4.0,Works well. Not as good as the old ones as far as quality. Needs thicker shoulder pads.
1.0,Missing part out if the box...disappointed because I owned one before
5.0,"Good price, super fast shipping. Everything as described"
5.0,Great
1.0,"I would love to rate this item on how well it works.  However, the box I received was not complete.  The two bolts and washers were thrown loosely into the box.  The manual was not included.  The cap, needed to close the tank, was not included.  I needed this sprayer for my gardening and now I need to wait for parts to arrive before I can use it. I had spraying to do before I could get my garden ready for planting.  Now I don't know whether  the timing will work out or not.  It depends on when I can get my cap for the tank.  Of course, this is Saturday, so I can't even call to ask for the missing items until Monday.  Very frustrating!!"
4.0,"Works exactly like it's supposed to. The only issue I have concerns me, not the pump. When it's full (or half full even) it's cumbersome to get into the harness. I bought the upgrade harness and it helps somewhat."
5.0,Works perfect
5.0,old fashioned and simple.
5.0,Extremely sturdy well made product that works as intended.
5.0,"Works great. I've dropped it a few times and its still not broken,  Other cheap ones have broken where this one hasn't."
5.0,As hand sprayers go I have had a dozen of them but this one is pretty good quality-much better than cheap Hardare store types I have bought-worth the price!  Good molding and quaity of brass-the action is very smooth.
5.0,"Remember the hose nozzle your parents had in the 80's? This is it.  It's simple, solid, and all you really need."
5.0,I'll never need another nozzle...unless I get another hose :) pretty much the best I've ever used.
5.0,Works fine for the price
3.0,What can I say...CHEAP CHINESE JUNK!  Yes it works but very cheap quality compared to the very old Gilmour that finally leaked.  If made in USA and a couple dollars more with better quality casting it would be 5 star.
5.0,worked as expected. seems to be good quality for the price.
4.0,Good.
5.0,Rugged
5.0,Quality product!
4.0,It's totally the best!
5.0,They are awesome.
5.0,These work great
4.0,Good
4.0,good product and works well
4.0,"These work great! I originally used them to cut flowers for arrangements and they were great. Nice clean cuts! I then used hem to trim hedges, etc. They are good quality. Four out of five stars because I barely for them wet and they began to rust on the surface. Normally the factory coating lasts a few drops of water. But baking soda and a toothbrush and a light recoating of coconut oil does the trick!"
3.0,"The silver coating is peeling off and the blade doesn't meet the bottom tight enough to cut a lot of things. They haven't broken yet, so they aren't complete junk, but they are very poor quality"
4.0,Thank You
4.0,"This saves me a lot of time from having to move sprinklers around.

CAUTION: If you're NOT on a city system with constant pressure but instead on a private well (like me), expect stalls and stops while the pressure rebuilds. Also, use lightweight hoses and keep the hose length to about 50"" maximum. Otherwise the weight of the hose overloads the pressure of the water and the sprinkler will stall."
4.0,"While this sprinkler does, indeed, follow the hose, and lay down a nice even pattern of water, it falls short of the claimed performance on a couple of issues.
(1) Its travel rate on ""Lo"" is much slower than the claimed 21 feet/hour. It took ours 7 full hours to travel about 70 feet.
(2) Its ability to cover a 200' run of hose is doubtful. Again, our experience was that it was slowed visibly at the end of a 70-foot run, and might have bogged down completely before reaching 100 feet.

Otherwise, with a 100' hose, it provides even hands-free coverage, and will be put to good use throughout the dry summer months ahead."
5.0,I have been using a Raintrain since 1987!!  I left that one with my old house when I moved.  I have about an acre and a half to water now so I decided to get a new one.  It is easy to use and takes very little supervision.  It can jump the track occasionally but it takes 99% of the work out of watering the grass.  I considered a sprinkler system but this is much easier and hundreds of dollars less.  People actually slow down and watch it when I use it in the front yard.  This is one of my best invetments.
5.0,I've owned other brands and have been disappointed.  My last walking sprinkler had the plastic gears stripped so this time I bought a Nelson which is actually the brand I've kept my eye on but couldn't always find it at stores near me.  After a month or so it's working perfect.
3.0,The traveling sprinkler go's around my yard without me having to water my grass. Thanks to the traveling sprinkler my yard looks ok. I had one problem because it kept going off track. Thanks traveling sprinkler it needs to be  improved!!!
4.0,It will pull about 150' of hose but will spin the wheels in bare patchs. Don't put the shut off on a tight curve or it will derail and not shut off.
4.0,Fully adjustable for width of coverage and volume of water delivered.  Tracks the hose well and shuts off when it hits the ramp.  Set it and forget it... or just watch it crawl along with a beverage.
5.0,"I recently had to have sod laid in my back yard. I tried using a sprinkler and moving it every hour or so but I could not always remember to move it or find the time to keep it up. I remembered my parents had a sprinkler that traveled the length of your hose so I went searching and found the Nelson Raintrain. It will travel along 200 feet of hose or less and that was perfect. Just follow the directions and let water pressure and the Raintrain do the rest. When I first used it I would keep looking out to see if it was moving and it never stopped until it go to the included shut-off ramp. The only thing you have to watch for is making sure the sprinkler arms do not hit anything. If it gets ""snagged"" on something (like a fence post) it will stop the sprinkler and it will stay in the same place watering the same place until you move it, easy fix. I love the Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler and I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone! By the way, my youngest sibling saw it and said ""hey, mom & dad had one just like that."" As it turns out... it was made by Nelson, too!"
5.0,now that I have my second tractor sprinkler my yard gets done in under 2 hrs. I can set it in 3 different  speeds.
5.0,"I used this all last summer to spray fish and seaweed based fertilizer around my 2 acres of orchard and gardens.  It works well for me.  I bought a longer tube for the wand so I can reach higher in my trees.  The pack is reasonably comfortable to wear, even when full because it is well balanced and the handle for the pressure pump is easy to access when walking.  When spraying my trees I tend to lock the trigger in the ON position and use the pressure pump to maintain a constant pressure.  I find it very easy to use.

The only problems that I have had are that the soft plastic tube came loose from the main tank and the trigger sometimes doesn't work correctly when locked in the ON position for too long.  The plastic tube coming loose caused my pants to get wet because the fluid started coming out through the bottom.  It was an easy fix and just required adjusting the tension on the clamp holding it in place.  I think it came loose partly because I had put too much pressure in the tank.  I deal with the trigger problem by sometimes releasing the lock when walking around and it seems to be fine.

Even with the small problems that I had I still love this unit and am glad I bought it.  I would certainly buy it again if I needed a second pack."
4.0,Great yard tool.
3.0,These are OK sprayers. First one leaked so we ordered another. One of the guys just brought in another one leaking but we got over a year out of it.
5.0,"This is my second backpack sprayer from Solo. I have labeled one for herbicides and the other for pesticides. They are easy to use, clean and maintain. The tank holds so much that I can mix just what I need for the project and not have to refill. Great product."
5.0,"Great sprayer, I purchased the piston rebuild kit here on Amazon (Solo 0610407-K Piston Sprayer Pump Repair Kit) and the wand rebuild kit (Solo 0610411-K Sprayer Wand/Shut-off Valve Repair Kit) even if I did not rebuild this sprayer, I feel I have gotten plenty of value from this unit, and would not have a problem purchasing a new one. I do believe ""Solo"" is a German company...hence the quality.
Update Oct. 2015 : still going strong.
Update March 2016 : still going strong...using Round-up (15 gallons per season) without rinsing unit after use."
5.0,YE
5.0,Works great for such little size!! Would encourage others to buy--ver light!!
5.0,I've had this for two years now and use it for my 2 acre vegetable plot.  I hope it lasts me another year.  Very pleased with quality and price.  It is my third solo sprayer.
5.0,Love it - the best back pack yet
5.0,Fine product. This was a replacement for the same brand.
5.0,Working great!
5.0,Good product
5.0,"Sturdy and sharp, just what I needed. Arrived quickly."
5.0,I have used fiskers products before.  they are good quality and well built.
5.0,Pleasantly surprised how good these work for the low price. Cuts through much thicker branches than we thought they would.
5.0,Fiskars products are some of the best on the market.
5.0,"Extremely effective. Great grips, properly-sized, and it locks in place. I've cut through decently large tree branches with this with minimal effort on my part and am beyond satisfied with the purchase."
5.0,love them.
5.0,Incredible power.  Eliminated the need for a small-medium size pruner for me and much easier to use!
1.0,"I used these for the first time today and am very disappointed.
They hardly cut through the small twigs/branches.

Until this pair, I have always had great experience with Fiskars."
3.0,SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER COME OUT
5.0,"As expected, no surprises"
5.0,"Definitely the best nozzle for most situations, its extremely sturdy there are no plastic pieces so no leaks, I like the fact that I don't have to change settings to have different spray settings."
1.0,broken in 3 months
5.0,"Can be regulated at will, for spray or power, solid metal no plastic!"
4.0,very nice
5.0,Love it!
5.0,We've used it for a summer with no problems.
3.0,ok
4.0,"I like it.  Nice solid construction.  Nothing fancy, but does what it should.  It's been slammed onto the pavers a few times already and has not broken yet."
5.0,"Solo makes great sprayer.  I have 10 orchard trees, and my first back-pack sprayer lasted over 30 seasons!!!  The new model is similar, and I like it."
5.0,"It is so light, and easy to use!"
1.0,"Poor quality, the plastic clip that connects to the diaphragm pump snapped after only being used 10 times.  This is the achilles heel of this backpack sprayer, once this clip snaps the sprayer is no longer usable.  Solo need to rethink their design here.  I can't recommend this backpack sprayer after my experience, look elsewhere if you want something that is durable and going to last."
5.0,Best sprayer we have ever used.
3.0,"Not quite what I was expecting...I think there's a deluxe model out there, and that is what I should have probably purchased.  Everything arrived in one piece, but there was one piece missing...the o-ring where the wand attaches to the handle...so annoying.  I had an o-ring in a drawer, so crisis averted...still pretty tacky that it shows up without all necessary parts.  Assembly was straight-forward.  Make sure you put lock washers on the bolts (they're metric) for the pump handle...or they'll work themselves loose...again...tacky.  The clips at the bottom of the straps kept coming off until I began treating the sprayer like a prom queen...it's okay baby, I'll get you a latte, just sit still so you don't break a nail...sheesh.  And best of all...the lid leaked my first tank of herbicide!  Yay...fabulous...glyphosate all over my shirt, back, pants, belt...REALLY!!  Maybe the lid was having a bad day...poor guy...so misunderstood?  I'm going to pull the lid seal out and goop it up with plumbing grease...tacky.  The straps are thin enough to pass for...nevermind...they're too darn thin...does canvas and foam really cost that much?

Just checked...yes, there is a 425 Deluxe...same bottom strap clips...maybe the necessary o-ring?...less leaky lid?

Here's the last thing...the pump handle...it does not pivot in and out to adjust for gorilla or beanpole shoulders...it is bent to beanpole position and I have gorilla shoulders plus love handles.  Put it in a vice and after three tries achieved perfect position.

I am going to replace the plastic pins at the top of the shoulder straps with something metal...just because we know how that's gonna go one day.

Here's my bottom line.  We have an older one of these in the church grounds mxs shed, and an updated version of it is what I was expecting.  It's something like 15 yrs old.  Things have not improved in 15 yrs.

You have been warned...I'll probably just work with what I have, so it can't be that bad...right?  Spend the extra folks.  Apologies if the sarcasm was too thick...glyphosate on my shirt makes me grumpy.

Tacky."
5.0,"Good product at a good price.  I used this to spray Olympic Toner on my fence.  It's work lugging four gallongs on one's back, but it did the job.  Be sure to clean per the instructions so it will be ready the next time that you need it.  Would buy again!"
5.0,It works as advertised. The assembly is very easy to do. Within 5 minutes I was spraying around the exterior of the house.
5.0,A back pack sprayer is the way too go.  It just makes the whole painful process go that much easier
2.0,"This is the piston model, which is more durable than the diaphragm model, but it is still not very durable. The hose fillings have cracked and the O-rings have all split at one time or another. However, it is comfortable to wear and the spray works well, though it will not reach very high."
1.0,Bought four sprayers all sprayers leak. I sent them all back to solo. If you like chemicals on your legs this is te sprayer for you
5.0,This is by far the best sprinkler we have had! We live on a well and do not have the strongest water pressure and this sprinkler has no trouble we have tried many other styles and they always stop if there is a break in water pressure but this one just keeps going. I would recommend it to anyone and it doesn't matter how large or small the yard it works great!
4.0,"I bought 1 a year ago and a second at the begining of spring this year.
How it works: The device uses water pressure to supply its gearing with lubercation and force to drive it's large wheels to help it drag the hose that trails behind.  I have a newly established lawn that is not thick and has some bare or almost bare spots.  In addition the property has a slight grade.  I use a well and it supplies up to 7 gpm, during dry spells this may mean that more water pumps out then is replenished so with both sprinkler's running I need to ensure that I don't run them for over 2 hours.  I read one review that was very accurate and informative regarding the Nelson and their competition devices.  Thing I have learned:
120 ft is near the maximum for my lawn even if it is on a downward slop.
bare spots may result in the wheels digging and getting stuck
Connections may start to leak which worsens the performance (check those replaceable gaskets; 2 dollars for 5 at local store).
Treat with care and don't put too much pressure on the hose connection when moving the tractor
Turns must be gradual  for 90 degrees (taking 15 ft to complete the turn)
Keep the spray rods moving; I don't know if it is my imagination but when I attempt to cover 40 ft vs 50 ft of water it moves more efficiently to cover my lawn.
Use 5/8 hose
Always shuts off when I follow the above rules

and enjoy"
1.0,"I bought a new house at the end of March 2013, and ordered this for the backyard April 4th.  I had it delivered to my previous address so it wouldn't be shipped with the previous owners' things.  When I moved in May 1st, I started unpacking, and on May 15th I had a new neighbor set this up for me (I am wheelchair bound).  It started spraying water, but did not move forward as it should.  We reread the instructions and tried again, manipulating the ""wands"".  Nothing.  No water and no movement.  I called Nelson's technical support.

They told me exactly how the wands should face, and I turned the water on.  Nothing.  Then the black top holding the wands came off!  Technical support said it was obviously too much water pressure.  This is water from my backyard hose!

After many emails and telephone calls, this is what I was told about Nelson's warranty.  They will not send a new unit.  If I send them my receipt (over a month, so I can't return it to Amazon) and a photo of the unit in my backyard, they will send me a motor assembly, and I should take out the old one, put in the new one, and try, try again.  If that doesn't work, they'll send another (different) part.  It could be a number of causes.

I paid $61 for this Raintrain.  I can afford to write it off as an unethical and dishonest company that has a policy to send parts of a defective unit, not a new unit.  I don't consider receiving parts and trying to assemble an item in my wheelchair much of a warranty.  I will buy another sprinkler system on Amazon.com - definitely from another company.

I will never buy another product from Nelson, no matter how small or cheap it is.  I don't reward such non-customer support with future business, and I strongly recommend people do the same and avoid this product and this company.  I recognize Amazon is fault-free as the 30 day period for returns had passed, but I hope they read this review."
5.0,This sprinkler cannot be beat. You lay a track where you want to water with the hose that the tractor is connected to and the tractor follows the hose. Pricey but well worth it.
1.0,"I went through 2 of these in a week, one worked twice, the other worked for about half a foot then shut off.  Neither would work again.  I appreciate that Amazon took them both back, but was very frustrated with the products I received!  It's a great concept WHEN it works."
3.0,"It seems well made and certainly has quite a heft to it. Use two hands when moving it, you don't want to smack yourself in the leg or ankle with this fellow. Definitely agree on using a 5/8"" hose with it per their recommendation ( I bought a quality Gilmour hose and a nice Ames rolling cart to house it). Our lawn is neither flat nor steep; more importantly it is has some small bare spots which can pose a challenge for the unit to keep moving forward. If it cannot progress, you run the risk of stripping the gears and ending up with a very expensive stationary unit. I have been able to set it on a path which it travelled without problem. I'm working on the bare spots and definitely plan to keep it busy, but the bottom line is that, because of our lawn and the issue regarding it getting stuck in place, I don't yet feel comfortable simply setting it and forgetting it."
5.0,"Bought this for my hubby, who loves it!  We have had it for more than a year now, and have had NO problems with it.  It is heavy and works just as advertised.  It is slow, but does a thorough job.  There are other cheaper models that had sketchy reviews, and saw lots of great reviews on this one, so went with it.  Wasn't disappointed.  Would recommend."
1.0,"This is day 4 after opening the box.  I set it up to work on my flat lawn on day 1 and it ran well for a couple of hours.  I then did the same the next day.  On day 3 I turned it on again and it emitted water but no longer moved.  There was no opportunity for anything to happen to the gears by human intervention.  The device had not even been touched.  There was no hill, mud, or interference of any kind.  The length of the hose is only 175 feet and the description says it will go 200 feet.  It had stopped long before it even reached the 120' mark.  (It did get by the coupler between the 75 foot and the 100 foot sections of the hose so that wasn't a problem either.)

I got on the phone with a customer service person and she played semantic games with me trying to blame me for stripping the gears.  I told her that when the device is in neutral the wheels can turn but when it is set to high or low the gears don't turn.  She immediately jumped in and said ""well if the wheels turn when it is in high or low then you stripped the gears.""  I told her that is not what I said.  Later I told her that I was watering my lawn because it was just seeded.  She again jumped in to tell me that the device was made only for established lawns.  I had to explain to her that it is common for people to seed even established lawns.  It was only then that she said that I could send in a copy of the invoice and get a replacement for the ""plastic motor assembly"".

Bottom line: First, the product should not be sold--it cannot handle the tasks they say it was designed for.  Second, the customer service folks are so defensive they are probably taught to try to catch people who didn't follow the directions to the letter.  This bad attitude leads me to believe that this is a common occurrence due an inept product but is also supported by the business.  I am just hoping that they are not still making this piece of crap and instead they are just trying to get rid of their current stock by conning a limited number of new customers.  Think twice before joining me."
4.0,"I like this thing, just don't leave it out if there's going to be frost. Mine blew out the stopper on the bottom and we had to glue it back on the first night because the temps dropped. You need to read the directions or you're going to think this thing is broken. It works great now though"
5.0,"When I purchased this sprinkler, I feared that it would not work as described.  I was wrong.  Exactly what I wanted.  Now all of our neighbors also want one.  Highly recommended."
4.0,Received my Solo paackback sprayer thru normal shipping. Seems from Ozbo ( supplier) it took a little longer than usual. Anyway decent sprayer BUT doesn't hold pressure well as you are almost constantly pumping the handle to maintain good pressure. I have other Solo sprayers ( 2 1/2gal) hand held models and you don't need to contrantly keep pumping them to maintain presure like the backpack sprayer. Otherwise a decent sprayer.
4.0,"adjustable nozzle is good.  the wand is a bit flimsy, hope it holds up , same for the straps.
It is fine for getting in tight places where you cannot spray w/ motorized equipment, it is also quieter.
Also good for spot spraying noxious weeds like Johnson grass."
3.0,"Have used these sprayers for years and this is the first time I had one break straight out of the box. The two screws below the piston broke in half. Very difficult place to get to without disassembling half the unit. Like the performance of the product except for this irritating break down. The other two I purchased are doing fine, for now?"
4.0,"I've used my Solo twice spraying a 26 acre field for thistle and hawkweed.  Everything worked fine and at this point I'm pleased with my purchase.  On the negative side, the straps aren't the most comfortable and they do have a tendency to slip off my shoulder from time to time.  I think the harness upgrade would erase this problem.  All in all, for the price it works just fine for my application."
1.0,"This is a perfect example of keep em coming back for more because this sprayer will fail in a few years and the next model will be worse. NOBODY makes any thing to really last. Corp. profits would suffer and when 82% of the wealth is in the hands of 7% of the people that is the way it is going to be. Get used to it,UNLESS! you want a life time hammock then check out [...] this is where you can get your moneys worth"
4.0,"Come on Solo, include a decent harness with a $100+ unit.  Paying another $36 for a ""shoulder saver"" harness is not a good thing.  Why any company would ship a unit that weighs in at 40 pounds loaded, would ""include"" a 1"" wide waist to shoulder blade harness as adequate baffles me.  A back pack this heavy (and otherwise this good) merits a harness that wraps around the waist to take most of the weight.  Shame on you for selling a should saver (which you tried to wreck) for extra money."
3.0,I purchased to spray a small vineyard we own. a friend had one and liked the way it sprayed. it works well as far as ease of use and spray but its built cheaply. the straps broke the second time of use. i had to tie them on to use the rest of the season. im going to purchase the shoulder harness to see if it holds up better.
4.0,"Compared with cheaper models, this sprayer belongs to other universe.

It's  very light and handy.

Highly advisable.

Goodbye and greetings."
5.0,i have had a solo sprayer for many years and was just wore out needed a replacement works great my last one was a 3 gallon so glad to have the 4 gallon
5.0,"My neighbor uses this sprayer commercially,and I think it is Excellent. This is better than I imagined. I would recommend this to any person who sprays around their yard."
5.0,Raintrain works exactly as advertized. Looks cute while doing its job. It's essy to set up and stops at the end of it's trip. No need to watch it too much.
5.0,"On windy days, this crawler keeps the spray close to the ground so it doesn't get lost in evaporation from the high winds.  I love it.  It is a little heavy, but small sacrifice for the thorough job it does."
5.0,"Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.
----------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.

I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.

The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...

I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.

It does look cool and is fun to watch!

Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment."
4.0,"We have tried watering our large new lawn
It works as described but stuck multiple times due to gaps in the lawn.
Used 100 meter line with not many issues

I felt it watered the lawn more than required. Otherwise its easy to use"
5.0,I've been using this sprinkler for years.  The first one worked perfectly for several years until the gear did break.  The current one has been working just fine for the past few years.  I use the low speed to ensure a deep watering.  A great value.
5.0,i have owned them for years and they work great. they save moving the sprinkler all the time. would buy again
1.0,"This sprinkler is poorly made. The only thing made of metal is the main body, the rest is cheep plastic. Even if the cheep plastic parts don't break, it does not do a very good job and will not pull much hose before the wheels dig in.
My comments apply to the Orbit, Craftsman and what ever other brands this sprinkler is sold under. Yes they are all the same, and just look different.
To the best of my knowledge the only company still making a good traveling sprinkler is national. [...] They are kind of expensive but well worth the investment if you plan to use it.
The only other option is to find an old used Thompson or Kees at a yard sale.
Remember you get what you pay for!"
5.0,"The first thing you'll notice about this sprinkler is the weight.  It is very well made and solid all the way around.  I would recommend using this with a hose timer if you have an ""odd"" shaped watering area.  I have a somewhat small area to water at first, which then expands nearly to a perfect rectangle.  With the use of a hose timer, I can direct the water to that small area, time out how long the sprinkler takes to move out of that area and stop the water.  From there, a very simple adjustment to the arms allows me to cover the entire width of my lawn.  I can set the timer for another specific set of time, and be done with it.  The ramp/shutoff works fine as well, I just don't have the need.  Very good product overall; glad I purchased it."
5.0,I and my son in law own and have owned 8 of these sprinklers. They are the best I have ever used. The motors can be replaced when worn out for about $20.00.
5.0,"I bought this after reading the reviews, I have had no issues with it, other than I need a longer hose so I can do the whole yard without moving the hose.

I will buy a new one if this breaks."
5.0,"They get the job done! I've used these to trim all kinds of stuff in my yard, including medium sized tree branches. They're easy to use and don't require a ton of effort on your end either."
3.0,They are ok for quick use...the first time out had a lot of plants to prune down and they stopped cutting...needed a little tweaking and I also taped the lock open...it helped with closing capabilities while trying to cut roots...
1.0,not such a good book. very boring. I returned it.
5.0,Great.
5.0,love these.  much better than the other shears i have purchased thru the years
5.0,well made and worth the price
5.0,Good clippers at a good price
4.0,wish they would rachet for tough cuts
5.0,"Strong and sharp.  Very well made.  Does a great job of pruning 1/2"" thick saplings.  I've paid more for shears that weren't as nice as these."
5.0,Got these to use on my rose bushes. I love them.
5.0,"I finally have a decent spray nozzle, just like my parents had when I was a kid. I have gone through I don't know how many spray nozzles over the years trying to find a decent one. After having all of the break, leak or just fall apart over time, I went back to the old reliable. Solid construction, fits my hand well, and NO leaks."
1.0,Leaks not good quality
5.0,"My second one, for another hose. I think this is the best general purpose household hose nozzle I've ever used. Recommended."
5.0,So far so good. Nice smooth finish and very smooth operation.
5.0,Nothing special about it.  It just does the job
5.0,Heavy duty and do not rust. We use them on a boat that is in salt water and they've held up for years of rough use
4.0,"old school - surprisingly well made ... sorry, would've gotten a 5th star if it weren't made in China"
5.0,excellent product
5.0,"Great product, made of metal not plastic."
5.0,It works and so far the neighbors haven't stolen this one.
5.0,"I haven't had a chance to use it yet but it's very heavy and looks made well..Looks just like my neighbors down the street that gave me the idea..His yard always looks so pretty and green... I couldn't figure out for the life of me how his sprinkler was working, so I asked and this is what he told me to get..."
4.0,"I bought this as I have a large yard & as a nostalgic reminder of one my dad had years ago.  It's built like a tank & will go up & over most obstacles, through muddy puddles & works great as long as you use the recommended hose diameter & adequate water pressure.  If you don't, the unit will derail around curves.  Not recommended for small yards.  It's well made out of cast metal, so it's not a lightweight (which is a good thing 'cause it doesn't blow over in a wind)."
5.0,"If you have a large area that needs watering and do not have landscape sprinklers installed on all of it, this is an excellent way to accomplish that watering semi-automatically. The unit is well constructed."
5.0,"I don't know why it took me so long to get one of these. I set it and forget it. Talk about multi-tasking and not spending all your time moving the sprinkler around the yard. I even started a trend in my neighborhood. Once people saw mine, at least 3 other neighbors bought one."
5.0,Free up more time for yourself as you let this nifty little gadget perform the arduous task of watering the plants and lawn.  The sprinkler head rotates and travels down the length of the hose covering a large area and doing a much better job than any other method (besides an expensive underground sprinkler system).  Great invention which we first saw the neighbor using and we were glad to find it on Amazon.
1.0,"not operating as it should. I've had it on a shorter hose than allowed, yet, the tractor just stops in the middle of the yard, and I've had 2 months of very water bills, because, I guess, I thought I'd leave it alone at night, and it would stop by itself...wrong...had a John Deere one, twice as much, but 3 times better...I should have kept it, instead of going for the cheapo :("
5.0,We LOVE this sprinkler! Very handy to be able to run this at night and it will turn off when it's done.
5.0,"IF you don't mind sitting on a lawn-chair for hours while ""hand-watering"" your lawn while wishing you could get something else started or finished.  IF your only exercise program includes getting up and re-positioning the sprinkler every 30 minutes, THEN look elsewhere.
  IF a 'sprinkler system' is impractical or impossible AND you want to do something else while the lawn gets watered, THEN this will help.
I had purchased one of these locally 5 or 6 years ago. It finally ""gave out"" so I bought one here. I can run about 100  - 150' of USEABLE hose (have to go out every 3 -4 hours to slide hose along side to relieve weight/strain on tractor (Sure it's got those spikey wheels, but it can only lug around so much hose with water included ) ).
TIP: when laying out your hose, Rough it in place, then go back with the hook/handle of a walking cane (maybe a 'rejected' / cursed & useless golf club - probably a 3 iron) to smooth out curves while comfortably standing up.  LATER, I found a replacement motor and RE-built the old one. Now I use a tractor & a set of hoses for each end of the yard. NO dragging and dodging trees and shrubs.  ALSO consider buying a GOOD portable hose spool (OR 2)."
5.0,"can't wait for the growing season.  am thinking about adding a name or painting flames on the front.  a fine product, as it is very sturdy."
1.0,"My family had one of these for 20 years and it was awesome.  I had to send mine back to Amazon after 2 weeks because the gears are now made of plastic and stripped out.

The concept is great, but it just doesn't work with the cheaper materials.

Also the older ones shut off with an in-line valve on the hose that the tractor ran into.  This new ramp system with the button on the bottom of the tractor doesn't work.  The tractor would hit the button like 80% slowing the flow enough so the spinner would stop spinning.  This stopped the tractor, meaning it just sprayed the same exact patch of grass until you noticed it.

Sad.

Amazon gets 5 stars though for taking it back and paying return shipping on a freaking 20 pound hunk of junk."
4.0,"Application: Staining and sealing concrete floor
Result: Staining - worked perfect
Sealing - big trouble - We had sealer left in the hose overnight to make touchups in the morning, by the morning the hose had turned to mush so.... If you are going to use this for this type of application, make sure you thuroughly flush out or just replace the nylon hose prior to use with a teflon hose - other than that worked perfect.

I had to throw out entire unit after using - I chalk this up to the ""unique"" application we were using it for - will buy another and retrofit hose as described."
1.0,Bought one of these over ten years ago. It is still working and never gave me any trouble.  I do not have access to it anymore so I bought a new one last year. Immediately the cheap plastic buckles broke so I had to kludge the straps. Then this season the pump quit working. It has only had light use.  Good luck trying to work on the pump.  It is in the trash and I am using a small tank pump sprayer that is wrking much better. Never again.
5.0,"I purchased this sprayer because my non-backpack 2 gallon sprayer started getting annoying to carry around and refill so frequently.
I used this with some Termidor to provide exterior pest barrier treatments for me and 5 of my family members' houses.
The pump is easy to pump and provides great pressure for an even spread of product.
The wand has great features like locking it ""open"" so that you don't have to hold down the trigger for extended periods of time.
The nozzle provides a great range of options for the size of the area you would like to spray, which comes in handy.
FYI that the straps are not as ""comfortable"" as they look in the picture but still feel fine after wearing it for an hour or so.

My company is a large pest management company and we use these every day with all our technicians which tells you that it's a professional product."
5.0,"I have a lot of property and several different needs from a sprayer.  I need to be able to spray the house for bugs/pests, I need to be able to spray the weeds/vegetation to kill it off in some areas, just for bugs in other areas and I have fruit vines/trees/bushes that need to be sprayed.

This sprayer holds a whole lot of fluid, enough to get big jobs done.  There is no need to stop and travel back for more chemicals and water while in the middle of a job.  It pumps up easily, it maintains pressure with light pumping without totally wearing out my arm and it sprays out very nicely and a good workable distance.

I would agree that it does feel like cheap plastic, but that is not how it performs.  The shoulder straps could be a lot better and when full it is a bit awkward to get up on the shoulders, but for the price this is well worth the money.

If mine were to get run over by the tractor today, I would certainly buy another of this make and model to replace."
5.0,"I purchased this at a big box store to start with because my son had one just like it for the past two years and liked it very much.  when i got home there was no pump handle in the box.  tried to take it back to the local big box store and they did not carry that brand here. got my money back and ordered from amazon at same price without the tax.

It has gone over a 1 1/2 acrea yard twice now and has worked fine. no problems with leaks or getting it on my shoulder. you will want it up on a bench or tailgate when you put it on. this made applications for weeds so much easier. the unit fits well on the back and distributes the weight evenly. pumping is very easy and it comes up to pressure with 3 or 4 pumps.

makes me wonder why i carred around a hand pumped 1 ro 2 gallon sprayer so long to do the job.  sometimes it pays to listen to the childern !"
2.0,"Have been using this now only two weeks and its broken. The spray wand is made of the most cheapest plastic available I am sure. Talk aboiut cutting corners. In particular the trigger mechanism has a cheap plastic squeeze that has an even cheaper plastic insert that initiates spray. This broke on mine after about 4 or 5 tanks being sprayed. Real nice product here lol. I was ready to return this poorly made product and really should have but than saw I had a quality wand from another sprayer from a different company that lasted a few years till it finaaly broke but the sprayer still worked so I put on this sprayer. So the other spray wand from a different company lasted years and now is still working on this sprayer,yet the one the solo came woith broke in a couplke of weeks. Unreal ! Keep in mind too that the Solo sprayer is not cheap either. The fact that Solo puts the most cheapest parts possible in building this sprayer yet charges and arm and a leg for it is sickening.

If the rest of the sprayer( most noteably the pump) have these same cheap products that the wand and trigger have than they will no doubt break as well.

I would avoid this product as it will break if used even a few times it is only a question of when."
5.0,"I bought one of these backpack sprayers last year (not from amazon).  I worked mostly well last year, but by the end of the summer the sprayer valve was not working perfectly.  This spring I tried to use it.  The spay function worked well, but unfortunately the valve would not turn off.  I was not too happy about this.

I called Solo through a number I found on the website. I never got a electronic operator.  A person answered after 4 rings.  I gave a brief description of the problem.  She said she would connect me with the repair person.  She came back after about two minutes and said he had stepped out and would be returning soon.  I was sure this was the first step to a brush off, but gave my name and phone number.  Thirty minutes later I was surprised to get a call.  I gave another brief description and was told the solution was a new valve.

I gave my name and address.  Two days later I received a new valve at no charge to me.

I will definitely buy another product from them!"
3.0,"I have just received this and haven't had an opportunity to use it. It came out of the box with the clips for the straps broken. It was simply thrown in the box in pieces with no packaging.
I should have looked at the reviews as it is also not suitable for the Demon Dust I use. I should have read the reviews as it is mentioned there. NOT in the write up the manufacturer provides.

The 425 has a piston pump (for liquid additives),

(the 475 has a diaphragm pump for powdered and / or liquid additives. Make sure you get the one that you need.)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solo-425-4-Gallon-Professional-Piston-Backpack-Sprayer/dp/B00002N6BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solo 425 4-Gallon Professional Piston Backpack Sprayer</a>"
4.0,Unfortunately I have only been able to use this on a limited basis as the type of spraying I need to do requires an average amount of rainfall and we are currently in a severe drought.  I did use it when it first arrived for about two three hour sessions and have been very pleased. It functions just as I had hoped.  I recommend it.
5.0,"I first purchased a Stanley back pack sprayer from Sam's Club which worked very poor, had to return and purchased this one for twice the price.  It was well worth the extra money, it pumps very easy and produces a nice even flow spray.  You can spray out the 4 gallons in about 15 minutes, with great coverage.  In comparison to the Stanley the quality is quite superb, like the pump handle itself, the straps, better washer with screen in the sprayer tip and also the parts on this sprayer are made of HDPE, for long lasting.  It is also USA made."
5.0,I will never buy those plastic ones again. This thing is perfect.
4.0,"Nice old school nozzle, just wish the internal tip was all metal like its predecessors."
1.0,It rusted. It started to fall apart after a couple uses. A water hose sprayer that rusts and falls apart!
4.0,Solid product
5.0,Plain and simple hose nozzle. Comfortable to hold and does straight to fog streams.  Seems solid and should last a while since I never drop my nozzle but place it down as common sense should tell you to do.
5.0,Very good quality
3.0,Worked 3/4 times I used it. The last time it was spraying from the connection.
5.0,water
5.0,"Works as expected. good product for the price.
5*****"
5.0,Quality nozzle. Much better than the plastic nozzles I've been buying.
5.0,"Bought these when I lost the spring to a different set of pruning shears. Like all of the Fiskars garden tools I have purchased they have performed just as I expect - great. I particularly like their garden knive - use it all the time and hard.
I lost the spring on a prvious pair of pruning shears with a ratchet and contacted Fiskars whether a replacement was available. Even though I told them I had lost the spring when I took it apart (which it turns out I wasn't supposed to do) they insisted on treating it as a warrantty issue and are sending me a replacement set of pruning shears. Now that is customer service which earns my loyalty."
5.0,Gets the job done
5.0,sharp and work great.
1.0,"I used to think Fiskars brand was a reliable indication of good quality. Thisn pruner has convinced me that they have degraded their standards. I would not cut butter, the blades are not aligned to meet correctly and it is not a useful tool at all.
MVM"
4.0,Seems to work well
5.0,Love my trimming tool. Great product & works perfect in my garden.
5.0,These pruning shears cut like butter!  So easy to work with.  I highly recomend them!
5.0,Well made.  Easy to use.  Sharp.
4.0,"satisfied, so far, seem to be nice, the blade lock works fine, easy to use, like them"
5.0,"So easy to use, best little garden tool ever. I can use it with my arthritic thumb even."
5.0,"I love this product, but it says not to use it to water when you are seeding. Not sure why."
5.0,Great alternative for us without sprinklers. This gives great coverage and will last longer than the knockoff Walmart brand. It even works good on the smaller strips of grass beside the driveway and in front of the sidewalk.
4.0,"I would have given this item 5 stars, but this is my second one as the brass coupling on my first one snapped off and the whole machine is useless now. I had only used it for a couple of years and then I finally decided to try another one after trying unsuccessfully to find a coupling that could fix my first one.
They are great time savers, as you once you have set it up you can forget about it and not have to keep running out and moving it around, like you do with regular sprinklers!"
5.0,"My Dad had one of these my brother in law bought one, they are so much cheaper than a sprinkler system... I tell my wife this is my kind of NASCAR... It works great!"
5.0,Was delivered on time and I have had no issues with this sprinkler.  Used it all summer.  I have a large back yard so moving sprinklers around was quite the task before using this product.
4.0,"Excellent product.  My second one.  Needs a level yard to
operate properly.  I recommend it as it can do the job well."
4.0,"Great sprinkler for the money.
Item description said used but looked like new.
Works great
would recommend for home use."
2.0,"was so excited about this product that I ordered 3.  Within a month on one and 3 months on another the gears stripped and would not move ""walk"" again.  Very disappointed at the gears were plastic and not very good plastic at that! Would not recommend this to anyone!"
4.0,"This tractor sprinkler has been great, especially in Texas where the drought has lingered on. It covers a large range of acreage and the conveninent mechanical shutoff makes it even better."
3.0,"Although it has been nearly a month since I received the sprinkler, I still have not received the stopping device which was supposed to be included.  I have contacted the seller several times.  They have repeatedly promised to send the stopping device, but have failed to do as promised.

I have used this type sprinkler before and have found traveling sprinklers to be great time savers.  This sprinkler does a good job and works as advertised.  If the seller had shipped the stopper that was supposed to be included, I would have rated the product with five stars as it seems well made and works well."
5.0,"Delivered as expected.  Product as expected.
. . . couldn't be more satisfied."
5.0,"Love these clippers, great quality and perfect for all my clipping needs. Very satisfied."
5.0,Great!
5.0,"Well made, sharp and comfortable in my hands.  I use these regularly when I am working in my flower beds cutting flowers or clipping limbs."
5.0,"Perfect for pruning the shrubs and hanging tree branches, quality product."
5.0,Nice clips
5.0,the best shears. This is my second pair.
4.0,good product
5.0,Easy to use and have a powerful cut. They seem very well made.
5.0,"Bought them for m diy wedding flowers. Ordered two, it saved us soooo much time and frustration. Would totally recommed it or the flower enthusiast, photographers that do their own flowers for styled shoots and just for the regular garden enthusiast. Very strong and sturdy. Was able to cut the thicker hydrangeas without any problem and have since used it on lemon branches and cuts them easily."
5.0,Good ole fashioned nozzle Works great
5.0,This hose nozzle works better than the multi pattern nozzle that don't last long. This is heavy and well made and feels good with the adjustable spray. I've only had it for about 5 weeks but so far so good.
1.0,"In theory this is actually what I want,  it is all metal so it should last significantly longer than the plastic one I purchased at home depot. At last, the threading is junky, the second time I attached it to a hose I shot most of the water out around the connection instead of through the nozzle.  I tested with a second hose, same result.  I was able to prevent most of the leaking by putting Teflon tape on the hose but with a thread connection you shouldn't have to do that."
5.0,"I have tried some of the fancier rubber attachments, but nothing can beat this simple metal design."
5.0,I can't believe something that cheap preforms so well. Happy I got it.
5.0,I love this nozzle! I got so sick and tired of having several cheap hardware store special nozzles break or corrode. This one has lasted three years so far with no signs of wear.
5.0,"Simple, gets the job done, inexpensive"
5.0,Works very well.
5.0,"NO MORE PLASTIC CRAP. THIS IS THE STANDARD METAL NOZZLE LIKE YOUR GRAND PAPPY HAD, AND HIS IS STILL WORKING GREAT !!"
5.0,"I love these, have used similar at times forever. However, be aware that if you live in California you may not have this shipped to you. You will get a strange message when you try to check out about the inability to ship the item and a laundry list of possible reasons, none of which makes the least amount of sense. After wrestling with this online for a few minutes I called Amazon Customer Service and explained my consternation. The guy puts me on hold a few minutes, comes back and explains that this and similar items can be shipped to anywhere in the U.S.A. except for California. The reason given is that it's forbidden by law because the item resembles a gun. Pretty nutty law. I'm all for gun control, I think we need a whole lot more of it but this law preventing me from ordering a water hose nozzle is preposterous."
5.0,"Love this little traveling sprinkler.  I can set it up in seconds and then relax while it waters my weird shaped lawn.  I don't have a sprinkling system, so this little traveler gets all parts of the lawn and stops by itself on the little attachment.  My neighbors want to know where to purchase one for them."
4.0,"Great way to water a large area. You can easily leave it alone for 4 hours and it just keeps going. I bought these because the 5 very similar sprinklers that I own are broken. The internal gears ear out and they stop moving. It is possible to buy replacement parts but I haven't actually repaired any yet.
With very good water pressure you can have 2 going at once."
5.0,Item was shipped very timely. I have an older Raintrain and the new one works much better. The rear wheels have better traction and pulls the hose better without getting stuck.
5.0,"I bought this based upon a friends recommendation and then reading reviews.  I was having issues with my lawn (another story) so I killed off my lawn, planted new seed and needed a wide area watering device.  I did not want to mess with moving around a small sprinkler, and I do not have in ground watering.

I received this and immediately set it up.  This thing just works.  It is also built like a tank, stupid solid.  I can't see this ever breaking, seems like something that was made a long time ago, and built to last forever.

There is very little learning curve aside from figuring out the optimal length it can travel (it has to pull the hose) and the correct radius of the turns for your yard.  Didn't take long to figure out.

It also has a hypnotic peaceful effect on you, it's mesmerizing to watch even thought it moves slower then molasses.  I plan on using this for many many years to come."
3.0,"I would not a purchased it had I known it was Made in China; the longstanding Nelson name gave me a false sense of 'american' pride that they would've kept the jobs here.
I will no longer buy any Nelson product unless I know it's been made elsewhere from China/Asia."
5.0,"If you have a lot of grass to water, you can't beat this prduct.  Puts down about 1/2"" with 1 pass."
5.0,"Heavy, sturdy and fun to watch. A painless way to water the yard. I am surprised how tightly it turns as it follows the curvy hose."
5.0,"Works great, saves us having to move the sprinkler so often. Is really cute! We have been using ours for 3 Summers now, still goes good. Brother-In-Law had tractor envy and had to get one too!"
5.0,"Best thing invented for watering your grass.  You just set it up and let it go. Two hours later, you reposition it and start it again.  I tried so many different sprinklers and none of them measure up to this!"
5.0,The Nelson Traveling Sprinkler works well and is easy to set up on odd shaped lawns. Both my wife and I used it to water our new grass.
4.0,Fairly new purchase.  Works as advertised.  Moves very slowly so you have to wait a minute to see that its moving at all.
5.0,Works great but follow the instructions and don't run it on dirt the weight of the hose will cause it to spin its wheels and bury itself. Much better therm 3-5 thousand dollars for an irrigation system
5.0,"This ""train"" does the job! Performs exactly as promised. No more worrying about forgotten sprinklers. Stops where you set it and waters at the pace you want. Going to get another one so I can water the front and back at the same time! Only wish it came in other color choices."
5.0,"If you like to be able to water large lawn areas without having to constantly move sprinklers, buy this machine!  Don't have to shut it off either so you can set it up and forget it."
5.0,"has good spread and being able to take out of gear to move, plus choice of two speed makes it nice. has been a reliable way to water the lawn without having to move it around much and the stopper piece, it will stop in case a person gets busy and forgets it."
5.0,Recently I purchased a Nelson Raintrain.  I have found it to be quite impressive. Impressive in how it covers the area being watered.  Impressive in how it moves and in how it shuts off automatically.  I would recommend it as a very worthwhile purchase.
5.0,"a great way to water a lawn,lots cheaper and easier than a sprinkler under ground system it's good  good good is that 20 words?"
5.0,"Attach the Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler to the end of your water hose, and set the tractor near the begining of the hose.  Turn on the hose and as the sprinkler sprays water around the tractor moves along the hose like it is on a train track.  This saves a lot of work because we do not have to keep moving the sprinkler.  It moves itself.  When it gets to the end of the hose it stops and then you can turn off the water until next time.  It is fun to use!!!!"
1.0,"can do the same with little or no effort with a $5 twirly.
not worth the effort or money.
how many words does it take to get across the point that it is worthless"
5.0,"Used 2 of these every day on 2 acres of horse pasture with a pressure pump.  Pasture looks better than
neighbors lawn.  Key is not to let to much hose drag behind, I pulled hose every 4 hours.  Amazon was
cheapest place to buy."
5.0,Excellent
5.0,These are great for 1/2 inch or less.  You can cut bigger but 1/2 inch is easy and comfortable.
5.0,Nice quality and very sharp
2.0,Disappointed with these as the locking system sticks and the blade lost its sharpness very quickly. Spend a bit more money for a better pair.
5.0,Good trimmers.
5.0,excellent
3.0,Great clippers but the lock slides into the lock position while using the clippers and it makes it very difficult to clip without using two hands (one hand to grip the clippers and the other hand to slide the lock off while clipping).
5.0,Works well.
5.0,Works great and its very sharp. Pleased with the purchase.
5.0,"I love to garden and I love using these shears to prune, cut down perennials, etc.  They are sharp and easy to use.  The price is right and they will last a long time with proper care."
5.0,Decent hose nosil..metal..the brass fitting on the back of the handle always works loose and has to be tightened
5.0,Great product...just as seller described
5.0,"the price, the precision of the jet, the quality of the material [ durable].
All perfect to me. I leave it outside all the time"
5.0,Nice ---solid...time will tell.....
5.0,As expected
5.0,"Bulletproof, way better than fancy plastic heads that always degrade and break."
5.0,"Great old fashioned spray nozzle, nice finish solid construction. I bought another!"
5.0,"Everyone is buying fancy nozzles these days, and I frankly had my doubts. This is my father's hose nozzle. Don't I want something fancier from Costco? Well, the answer is no. You want this one. I have been through a number of supposedly ""premium"" hose nozzles over the years bought from various well-intentioned stores, and many fizzled out, started leaking internally, etc. This thing is solid metal with a great piston in it. This thing can give you a variable jet from hard to a soft spray and will not leak. Sometimes the simplest really is the best."
4.0,"I have a dog who is a ""water biter"". He loves to chase the stream of water from the hose or sprinkler. After planting our garden this summer we could barely water it with him in the yard. It didn't take long for the kids to leave the old plastic sprayers laying in the yard where he attacked. I looked at a variety of metal and heavy duty sprayers and decided on this one. The price was right and it didn't look their was any part he could chew up.
Success! The dog has nothing to chew up.
So far it's worked great.
My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to adjust. If you want to switch from a powerful stream to a soft shower there is a small knob you must adjust. Once adjusted you can flip down a little lever to keep it on. It's worth the hassle to know it will stay on one piece."
5.0,Worked great and powerful this first week of heavy use
4.0,I have used these for years on a very large grass area.  One setting can last half a day and you get a more even distribution of water.  Adjusting the spray arms help tocontrrol  the width it covers and compensate for windy conditions.  The down side is that they are heavy to reset
5.0,"Works great! I had one years ago the the newer model works even better.  I like the automatic shut off when the job is done.  If you don't have sprinklers or they are just not working, this is a good substitute."
1.0,"I received my sprinklers on time but they both broke with in 3 days. They ran off the side of the shutoff pad and stripped gears. Will send them back to factory soon. This makes 4 and 5 of this type of sprinkler I have purchased over the past 21 years and have had great sucess with them on the past, did not have plastic gears in the motor. Very dissatisfied."
5.0,"This was a replacement for a Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler that was handed down to me from my dad when he got a sprinkler system.  He had used it for 10 years and I have used it for 13.  I have a large yard and I can water in much less time with this sprinkler, plus you don't have to move it - it moves itself.  Great product!"
5.0,I bought one of these tractors a couple of months ago.  I used it about 3 times per week with a 100 ft hose.  I like that the radius and speed are adjustable so I can control how much and where the water is distributed.  My only gripe is that it occasionally gets off track when traversing uneven ground.  So I have to check on it every half hour or so.
5.0,"Sure, it's a little bit time consuming to set the hose up in the pattern that you want it to run in.

Sure, it's a little bit of a pain to move it from one side of the house to the other because if you use more than 200' of hose for its path it can get stuck in place.

But you know what?

When compared to the $1800 to $3000 price quotes that we got to install a sprinkler system in the yard, I'll take that minor time consumption and annoyance every day of the week.  After you set up the hose once or twice and you learn how to effectively cover your yard, it takes five or maybe ten minutes to get up and running each time, and then it's fire and forget.

Well, unless you have younger kids, in which case it's ""fire and forget...and watch them have a blast running around it as it moves through the yard"".

I'm by no means a cheapskate...love gadgets, love technology, have all kinds of toys...but seriously, unless you've got someone buying a sprinkler system for you, just get one of these and be done with it.  Two other people in our neighborhood are annoyed beyond belief that they blew the money on in-ground sprinklers after seeing how well this thing works."
5.0,We have this same sprinkler at work.  I got one from online and it is freakin awesome.  It does exactly what it says and is very well made.  Highly recommended!
5.0,"I have had a Nelson Raintrain sprinkler for years and I have given another as a gift to my parents, -- both have worked for years.  I just purchased two more to give as birthday gifts to 2 of my children who have purchased homes and are looking at my sprinkler with yearning.  I expect that they will work just as well as the ones we've had for 15+ years and, if not, I will update my review."
3.0,"The sprinkler tracks fine and provides a decent watering pattern as it travels. However, you need significant water pressure to keep it moving. Additionally, if I use more than 100' of heavier hose, it struggles to pull it along. I suppose this would less of a problem with higher water pressure. Overall, a fine product...it just doesn't work well for me and will likely find its place on a shelf in my garage."
1.0,The tractor seemed easy enough to use.  It worked great for about a week.  Then all of the sudden it quit moving forward and would just make a clicking noise.  Now it's worthless and I have to pay to replace parts that have evidently broken or gone bad after just a weeks use.  At this point I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2.0,I received a cheap knock off brand that does not line up very well.  They work for hacking at things but they are not the smooth action I was looking for.
5.0,Love them. I find that even the expensive pruners usually list me only about three years. These work just as well. And aren't as expensive to replace.
5.0,"Works well, as expected."
5.0,Well made - hope to use them for a long time!
5.0,Really good quality shears. Not much hand strength required. Well made.
5.0,Like
5.0,good
5.0,solid
5.0,"These are excellent pruning shears. They are easy to use, excellent quality, and handles are nice to hold. They do not rust like my previous ones."
5.0,These are perfect for pruning!  So far so good.  Nice and sturdy!
4.0,"NOTHING lasts forever, get over it, especially in the CA sun!  But this is a basic sturdy inexpensive nozzle that gets the job done and is still going strong 1 1/2 years later, and it's even cheaper now than when I bought it!"
4.0,"Photo looked chrome but nozzle was gray. A little disappointed, still worked great!"
5.0,works great
5.0,Heavy duty. Others are cheesy.
5.0,good quality and no leak when connecting to hose
1.0,Could not tighten the spray to the hose. It was leaking water around the threading.
4.0,good
5.0,"Simple, low cost, and work great! It seems to be high quality one. Hope it will last for a few years. None of nozzles which I have bought before lasted more than 3 years."
5.0,"I like metal sprayers over plastic,  THEY LAST LONGER!"
5.0,solid nozzle
4.0,"I like the sprinkler I had one before, but this one is starting to give me a problem the things on top that spin  and the water comes out of is starting to get hard to spin,"
5.0,I love it! We received it very quickly and were able to save our grass from the horrific drought. Great product!
5.0,"This is the best item I've ever purchased for my yard.  Absolutely!  It has given me back summer days. Instead of trying to be home to move my hoses all summer, I can set this up once and get over ten hours of watering from one layout.  If I had a longer hose, I could do my entire yard at once.  We live in northern Montana on the border of Glacier National Park.  Our climate is harsh, and as a result, we have a lot of lumps and bumps in our yard from all the freezing/thawing cycles each winter.  This genius even manages to cope with our uneven lawn.  My only regret with it is that I didn't order one years ago.  It is very well built, and I anticipate it will outlive me. It is fascinating to watch it travel along.  The automatic shut-off feature means that you can relax knowing you aren't wasting water if you aren't there to turn the water off when it has finished its travel.  I am absolutely in love with this sprinkler."
2.0,"I sent mine back on the second day... It pulled less than 70 ft (in 2 seperate pulls) then the gear box started skipping. $8 to ship it back to the Peoria IL repair center. Repiars were quicker than the 4 to 6 weeks stated in the returns paperwork. When I called the repair center in the second week they said ""Hold onto your receipt"". The warranty period is two (2) years. I'm guessing I'll need it again."

I plan to make this short and sweet!!  I have owned the Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler for over 20 years.  I have owned TWO.  Yes, they may be a little trouble but they do work GREAT and save a lot of time from going out and moving a ststionary sprinkler!! I usually look out the window and watch the movement, say every 30 minutes to make sure it is following the hose.  Anyway; I would highly recommend this watering system.  The do NOT break and last a LONG time!!!!!!! I have read most of the complaints but in a perfect world one should purchase a five to 10 THOUSAND$$$ underground system!!!  For me the Nelson does the job!!!!!!!!"
5.0,I love my Nelson tractor so much I bought another one. With the adjustable arms I can water next to my house without hitting it or I can go for distance and cover my yard. Having two is nice it allows me to set them up and relax. Also I can set up both side by side and cover a huge area and bet on the winner. Lol
1.0,"I sent an inquiry a few days ago to the company, and have not received a response. I bought a Raintrain from Do It Best in Champaign. It worked for a week, then ran over the stop block and stopped at a rock and kept running. Now it will barely move, and there is a clicking sound when it attempts to move. I assume a nylon gear was stripped when the stop ramp did not work. I want a replacement. I'm waiting for their response after a second inquiry today."
5.0,We have an older Nelson traveling sprinkler and loved it so we were searching for one just like it.  This sprinkler is amazing...travels around our yard following the hose and shuts the water off when it reaches the stopper.  One of the easiest sprinklers you will ever use.
5.0,My dad has one that he has owned for what seems like 20 plus years. Sure it weathers a little bit but if this one last half as long I will be happy. Shipped fast. Easy to set up and go. Works excellent. Debating on buying another for my front yard.
1.0,"I recently purchased my second ""Raintrain"" sprinkler and sadly, it's already kaput. My first one lasted over 8 years. While the metal body is designed to last forever, the important parts of this sprinkler are now made of plastic. After only a few short weeks, my new sprinkler's gears are already stripped and it doesn't move. It only sits there clicking. click....click...click...Save your money. It takes a serious sprinkler to be worth $60. This one no longer cuts the mustard."
5.0,I'd buy these again.  Very sharp and easy to trim roses and other plant material.
2.0,The tips of the sheers don't meet so you must cut further down the blade. Hard to do detailed trimming. Good really only for rose bush sized branches and up.
3.0,Rubber handles slide off after first use.
5.0,Awesomely sharp! I like to use these in the garden. I like that I can lock them closed. I prune our apple tree branches with no problems.
5.0,These work great!
5.0,This is a  great basic pruner that cuts through outdoor plants and rose bushes and indoor bouquets. The handle is comfortable and the locking feature is nice.
5.0,Fiskars Traditional Bypass Pruning Shears ...Work perfectly.
5.0,Well made does the job thanks
5.0,Very well made and durable. So much better made than my last pair that fell apart and could not cut through very many things.
5.0,"Cuts well, time will tell on quality. It feels well made."
3.0,"Didn't work for watering an equestrian riding arena.  It would spin in the sand trying to pull the weight of the hose, and then shut itself off.  Would probably work well on grass or a harder surface."
4.0,"My lawn is very tiny, it's not even really a lawn, it is similar to the strip of grass on the side walk.  I have both the sidewalk grass and the similar strip in front of my house.  It is long and narrow.  I couldn't really use a sprinkler because of the shape so I got this thing and it works great.  The strip of grass in front and along the side of my house is sloped so it fell over once.  After that I just put it at the edge of the side walk and my grass and it waters both my grass and the sidewalk grass strip at the same time.  If you can't afford a sprinkler system this is the next best thing.  My neighbors did laugh at it though but I don't care, they don't even have a lawn because they live in a middle unit townhouse.  So I get the last laugh. =)  I definitely recommend it for any lawn as long as it isn't too hilly, I think it can climb a hill but not walk along it because it will just roll like mine did."
3.0,"The product works as advertised. However, it takes almost an entire day to water a yard about about 7,500 sq ft in size. My advice would be to buy a few $5.00 oscillating sprinklers, move them around your yard a few times, and get the job done in an hour or two. I do regret buying this product and would not recommend it to a friend."
5.0,"I have two rain trains. One I got from my father about 25 years ago. He used it for at least 15 years before giving it to me.
Still runs great, as a matter of fact, it is watering the back yard right now. I bought a new for the front yard a few years ago with the shutoff on the bottom. After only about a month it kept shutting off for no reason. I had to put a small hose clamp around the shutoff to keep it running. Other than that and the usual issue with sharp curves it works very well. I bought small timers and put on my outdoor faucets so it does not end up in the neighbors yard."
3.0,These devices are really rather useful. The Nelson Raintrain was bought and price and at time of writing I have only been using it for 2 months but it works fine. The yellow paint has faded quickly and there is a tendency to get off the rail (hose) and make its own way across a yard. This is at least part due to the hillocky nature of my lawn which also explains the one time the cut off valve got activated for no obvious reason. Smooth lawns probably lead to faultless operation.  I liked the product enough to buy one as a present for a friend.  The acid test will be to see how long the plastic gears last in the sealed plastic gear box. If I get 2-3 seasons use out of it I will be satisfied.
5.0,"I love this thing!  I truly hate lawn work and moving sprinklers.  I put this out, put down the shutoff block on the hose and walk away.  To be on the safe side, I also have a timer on the hose as a secondary shutoff.

As for quality, it is good.  I have read the reviews where people have had difficulties.  I think in many cases it was poor planning.  The spinkler doesn't do tight turns well.  It will jump the hose.  So plan your hose route accordingly.  It doesn't like switchbacks either because the hose doubles on itself.  It moves 37' /hour on high, 20' /hour on low. 100' kink free hose and ur good to go."
2.0,"Have had this product for only a month and have used it four times.  I use it only on a flat surface and in a straight line from one side of my back yard to the other side.  If I read the information provided with the product correctly, it has a high setting that is supposed to move at ~40' per hour and a low that is supposed to move at ~20' per hour.  The first time I used it, it seemed to work fine but then it slowed down dramatically on the second use and is now very slow.  On the high setting it now takes the unit I purchased ~7 hours to go 75'(~11 feet per hour).  During the last use I heard a clicking sound from the unit as it moves (barely).  I do not recall if it made this same sound the first three times I used it, but I believe there is a problem.  I have neighbors that have this unit and have had no problems, so I believe it is just a defective unit.  I will contact Nelson to return and replace it."
5.0,My husband is enthralled with this sprinkler and I don't even have to ask him to set it up.  It is a very sturdy product and seems to do the job quite well. It does take a lot of the work out of moving sprinklers around in beds every few hours.  We bought it because a friend had had one for a couple of years and recommended it.  Amazon has the best price that I could find.
5.0,Have had one in the past.  Does an excellent job watering and stops when you want it to.  Covers a small or large area. Great item for watering.
1.0,"Bought this product after owning another for 10 years with no issues until it finally stopped working. The new one is obviously not made from the same materials as they used to be. The new one worked 3 times and then stopped traveling, the arms spin but it will not move.
After contacting Nelson regarding this product I was told I needed to send back the gearbox to them so they can fix or replace it. The person I spoke to was lackluster at best.

I bought a product expecting it to work, I did not buy a product to have to take it apart and change parts that may or may not work.....

Don't think I'll be buying any Nelson or Gilmour products again..."
5.0,the screw comes loose on it sometimes but i love it
5.0,A very strong spray.  The threaded nozzle proved very handy for attaching a gentle sprayer since I use this for gardening and not for cleaning.
2.0,"Yes, it's all metal but it's not as sturdy as I had hoped. It's made in China and feels kind of cheap. It works but I'm looking to replace it after just a few uses."
5.0,"Same exact product costing less at local store, not enough difference to bother Amazon about it, but nice product.  The new ones from Amazon are exactly the same as a 5 year old one I bought at a local store for less, which I still use, just a small amount of corrosion.  Great product."
5.0,"I bought these as kind of secondary or spare nozzles, but when I tested them, they worked even better than I thought they would.  Ab"
5.0,"Just what I needed. It is what it looks like, and it is a high quality item.

Some of these garden hose sprayers are cheapo. This one is not."
5.0,All I wanted was a spray nozzle that wouldn't break when I drop it on the driveway or leak after winter storage. This one is a classic design and holds up to abuse. I love it!!!!
5.0,light weight works great
4.0,Tough- works well
5.0,Exactly what I expected.
1.0,"The sprinkler worked good for three days.  After calling customer service at Nelson,  I was told the motor needed to be replaced.  As the hubs are a pain in the butt to get off the wheels to get to the motor,  I haven't sent off the part yet.  Not pleased with it only working for three days.  Will be ticked if they don't pay postage."
4.0,I bought the Rain Train after someone stole my Gilmour John Deere one. I looked at replacing the Gilmour but they were discontinued and they were going for $150-200. So the Rain Train at $55 was very attractive. So I am a bit biased since the Gilmour worked Flawlessly. The olny reason the Rain train does not get 5 stars is I can't get but a 50/50 shot at making a turn without jumping the hose. Other wise it works great.
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about Big Yaller, as we dubbed this contraption.  In many ways it's ingenious; in others, it's a huge pain.  The construction is solid and the concept is quite clever, particularly the ramp for turning it off automatically.  But the set-up time is monstrous, and I invariably end up getting soaked because I'm too lazy to turn the water off time after time while figuring out the configuration of the sprinkler arms.  Big Yaller occasionally ""jumps the hose"" and goes on a renegade run across the lawn.  She can also go backwards if you point the arms the wrong direction, and on a couple of occasions she got hung up on the off-ramp and dug a tidy trench in our lawn with her toothy back wheels.

It's been an experience!  For a typical suburban lawn, this is probably not the answer, but the engineering behind this product provides a fascinating education regardless."
4.0,"I've had several of these traveling sprinklers and when my last one gave out, broken hose connector, I looked for parts for it.  The parts are very expensive so I bought this completely new sprinkler for just a few dollars more than the one part that broke.  It works as advertised and great for anyone that has a long area to water."
5.0,I'vd had this sprinkler for 30/60 days. My back yard is more than a quarter acre and I have attached a 150 ft of hose in a semi cicle and at a slow speed. It  does a great job. The temp today was 103.4. I had a very old similar iron type purchased in 1966. I prefer the current purchase because of the  water turn off devise. It works great.  This sprinkler is a well designed product that works as represented.
5.0,"Have had a lot of fun with this tractor, works great....good job of saturating my lawn. My kids didn't understand why i was excited about these tractors i havnt seen since i was a kid. Next best thing to fixed sprinkler system....flexible."
5.0,I love this sprinkler! I was ready to spend $5000 on an irrigation system and decided to give this a try first.  Saved myself a lot of money.  Minimal time spent setting it up and it does a fantastic job!!
5.0,"This works well, putting on a half inch of water per pass. also shuts off dependably, allowing watering during the day when no one is home to watch it."
4.0,"This does a good job on fairly level areas.  I have trouble with getting it to turn.  Must be a large radius turn to keep from jumping the hose.  It is nice not to have to go out and change the sprinkler postion every hour.  Have only used it a few times, so I'm still learning the in and outs."
5.0,"We just spent the last 3 hours rocking on the porch watching the dang thing roll across the yard and couldn't take our eyes off it. It is truly hipnotic. Works great and the Auto-Stop is GREAT!!
UPDATE 12/15/2012, Tractor crashed and died, by jumping the hose, falling over and stripping the plastic gears inside. TRASH, repair parts would cost more than a new tractor! Shipping and handling for warrantee too expensive!"
5.0,"These are sturdy, easy to use, easy to grasp, easy to close (orange plastic/rubber slider). They will make a clean cut on roses and also cut through most bougainvillea branches--except for the very widest ones. They don't gather a lot of sap or debris on the blades either. I've had more expensive pruners that fell apart. As a rule, I don't keep these outdoors because I don't want them to rust (as previous pruners have) so I can't say if they are weatherproof or not."
3.0,Mine just broke after a year - the bolt fell out somewhere in the garden.
5.0,Very sharp and do not get stuck like previous ones I've used.
5.0,great clippers
5.0,Wife likes these since the closure mechanism is very easy to use. Cuts well and appears that it will last many years.
3.0,Handle grips slipped of it right away.
5.0,"The great solution for my roses! I love this product bc it gives a precise cut, and it's very clean, so the roses grow healthy!!"
5.0,"these things cut like crazy, they are sharp, cuts right through small stuff like a hot knife in warm butter. I also didn't mind that the cost on Amazon was just over half of the price at the big box store in my neighborhood."
5.0,Love all fiskars tools.
1.0,"Pruning shears blade bent/deflected on first use trimming branch less than 1/2"" in diameter.  Returned to amazon.  I have a pair of Fiskars 28 Inch Bypass Lopper (91466949J) that I like and highly recommend but have very different use.  I am considering a pair of Felco's but they are 4 times as expensive as this Friskars hand pruner.  Maybe you get what you pay for?"
5.0,Good pressure and sturdy.
1.0,"I bought two Gilmour nozzles 2 1/2  years ago.  One nozzle is in the backyard, exposed to a very hot summer sun and to winter rain.  I turn the backyard water on only once a week and I relieve the water pressure in the hose after I finish.  The other nozzle is attached to a hose inside my garage, protected from the weather, but turned on only about once every two weeks and I also relieve the water pressure in the hose after I finish.  Yesterday, after only bi-weekly use, about 60 uses in 2 1/2 years, the sheltered garage hose nozzle sprang a bad leak, an ungrounded black pepper sized hole on the handle near the hose connection, after I had left the hose unattended in my driveway for 5 minutes.  Returning to the garage, I heard an unhealthy and worrisome hissing sound, as water was furiously jetting out the small hole, a bad scene in drought stricken California.  I had thought the protected garage nozzle would last a lifetime.  I'm surprised by the nozzle body leak after I had bought Gilmour nozzles the past 35 years for my different homes after my Mom had bought her first Gilmour nozzle many years earlier.  Gee, I understand the nozzle shaft seals leak a little after 5 to 10 years of use but a hole in the body is a surprise.  Gilmour quality has gone downhill and it's best to look at other brands.  :-("
4.0,Works as advertised. Solid nozzle.
1.0,"doesn't last for long.
i ""stuck"" to this type because the plastic once break pretty quick but after going threw few of those (same exact)  I gave up.
let them fall on the floor couple of time (nothing extreme) and they leak.
I am trying now the ""GrowGreen"".
will post my experience there."
5.0,"Excellent product, rapidly delivered."
5.0,Works fine
4.0,Its a nozzel hope it lasts awhile
5.0,excellent-- handy and well made
3.0,"This used to be made in USA then Gilmour sent it to China.. Right where it used to say made in USA it says Made in China. Had I known that, I would not have purchased. We need to buy American to help our country"
5.0,"Here is the deal. I'm 62 years old and this is the same type nozzle I remember as a teenager. The harder you squeeze the handle the spray pattern changes. Full pull puts out tons of water just like the old days! Forget the fancy looking ones and buy this one, you won't regret it."
5.0,"As I young adult, 28, I grew up seeing these things doing their business in people's yards.. I bought a house 2 years ago and needed a solution for a large lawn.. I didn't want to drop $5000 on a sprinkling system.  Decided to grab one of these time-tested classics.

When I took it out, I was amazed by how heavy duty it is.. For anyone that is wondering.. It turns itself off when it hits the ""stopper"" .. There is a shut-off valve operated on a spring on the bottom of the Raintrain.  When the stopper runs into the shut-off valve, it closes the water's path. I run mine on an Orbit timer I purchased off Amazon if I only want to water for a few hours.

When they say it can throw 55' Diameter.. They aren't lying.  I wanted that coverage and I'm definitely getting it.  I've given it a few weeks of hard work.  The book states that it can go up to 200' depending on the hose weight.  Well, I normally use Craftsman rubber hose.. which is very heavy duty.  I quickly realized that this thing probably won't make it 100' with this hose.. so I took out some of my standard-duty vinyl hoses... 2 - 100' sections and connected them.

It makes it all the way!  I have a gradual incline that it has to climb.. probably a 30 degree incline.  It makes it to the end every night.  Grass is looking happy.. No real problems so far.  I have the shut-off get stuck once, but a simple tug and it was back in it's normal position.  Don't try to get fast turns with it, it may possibly get stuck."
5.0,"Who knew watering the yard was fun.  I have a large odd shaped front yard. With a little work this sprinkler gets it all without soaking certain areas. Minimal water down the street. You don't get soaked trying to move it while water is on! Plus it's great yard ornament. I""m a little afraid to leave it in the yard it's so cute someone might take it!"
3.0,"this is my review of the same style unit ""orbit brand"" but it applies here also.
If you have a freshly seeded yard these type sprinklers won't work, as soon as the unit gets to a bare spot it will get stuck in the mud (remember its travelling thru the area it has just watered).
I have only had it a week and it worked ok on the existing lawn it only jumped the track(hose) one time and than tipped over, when that happened the little button water valve on the bottom didn't make contact with anything so the sprinkler ran all night laying on its side. Not sure i would recomend this item but i don't dislike it enough to return it."
2.0,"I got tired of how many times this jumped the track. I believe the gears are plastic, as well, it stopped progressing along the hose.  I never abused my tractor sprinkler, always putting it away (fearing theft).  I ultimately bought a national walking sprinkler and added the brass arms so i would be done replacing this expensive item for once and for all. [...]  That item is expensive and heavy but is all metal and does a great job."
5.0,"I had to laugh at the few people criticizing this sprinkler. Really? It's a sprinkler people. This one works great because it moves itself and shuts itself off at the end ramp. What more can you ask for? Except for people who don't read directions, it works perfectly and is built well. I have hard well water and have had no problems for over 4 years. It's built primarily out of solid metal and will definitely save you time if you water your lawn. The kids get a kick out of running around it too and it really is neat to watch the first time."
1.0,"Planned obsolescence is bad for the environment, and the consumer. I own a version of this item from the early 1980s, all-metal construction (including the transmission). It's still going strong after 30 years.

This year, I needed a second unit due to a larger garden. I was dismayed to discover that Nelson at some point decided to replace the sturdy metal transmission with plastic. Why on earth would a company deliberately make a product worse?

Most businesses strive to improve their products. Nelson seems to have become the king of plastic - which in the demanding arena of sprinkler applications is a recipe for disaster.

Absent any official reason for the change, one can only assume that the company is more interested in selling parts, and replacements, than keeping landfills free from unnecessary waste and building a reputation for durable, environmentally friendly, long-lasting products.

If the cost to manufacture a metal transmission increases the retail price by $40, I'm sure many would be happy to have that option and would pay the extra price. As it is, this will be my last Nelson purchase. I've been burned by their liberal use of plastic before on other less expensive sprinklers, but I assumed that the Rain Train was still a top quality item, like it used to be. Only after I opened the box did I discover the truth - that they managed to go plastic on there too. It's really sad to see a business lose sight of what it means to be the best."
5.0,This is my second tractor sprinkler and I think they are great. They work perfectly and I would recommend them to anyone.
5.0,"i just love this product,you don't have to go out and move your sprinkler around, we get alot of compliments about this product,its very easy to use my grand daughter loves it to."
4.0,"I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too. It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.
Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.
The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation. My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.
I use this in my garden  and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.
This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price."
5.0,"This product is awesome.  It covers a lot of territory without having to move it yourself.  just lay the hose down and the tractor does all the work.  Once its going, you can go do something else for hours (depending on the length of hose).  I would tell anyone to buy this product.  Grest price also."
5.0,Smooth cut! Very comfortable! I've been using regular scissors to trim bouquets of flowers and of course they don't do the job. This was perfect!
5.0,very sharp and cuts branches like a breeze
5.0,Perfect little shears for some light pruning.  Ergonomic and sharp blade.
5.0,"I am a beginners gardener. This work fine and are a good price. They are easy to use. With two small children, I really like the lock feature. I used them to prune my roses and cut flowers from my garden. I would recommend this for simple everyday task in the garden."
4.0,"This is our second pair of these shears in a year.  The last pair we put through some heavy use--but nothing crazy.  It worked really well until the internal spring just popped out one day while I was cutting carrots.  Maybe those were a dud or we worked them too hard.  They are relatively inexpensive so we didn't mind buying a replacement.  New pair seems to be smoother.  FOr reference, we had used the shears to cut through grass squares we got from home depot.  Also used them to cut through plastic turn and to cut carrots into bite sized pieces for our puppy."
5.0,They are sharp and easy to use.  They cut through some pretty thick stuff in my yard.  They have a comfortable grip and get the job done.
5.0,"Great, sharp tool for yard work."
5.0,Excellent!!
5.0,These are great pruners! They're very sharp and I'm pleased with how well they've been able to cut through the branches and stems I've been pruning. I've kind of been using them more as trimmers because they were all I had at the time and they cut through some pretty thick bush branches on some of the bushes on the side of my house. The grip is also very comfortable and it's very easy to lock and unlock them one handed. I would definitely buy these again and recommend them.
5.0,"I have used this to trim 5 huge rose bushes, cut wire, cut open packages and all season long I use it in the garden. If you want a reliable great quality tool, then get this one. I will say it did get a bit dull but I have abused this thing like no other and it works great still"
1.0,"VERY Unhappy.  This sprinkler is a joke.  I have had these for years; and this one DOES NOT MOVE.  The post office will not accept this as I have opened the box, Well, yea, and so I am out the money I wasted on this product from Amazon.  So disgusted."
5.0,"I originally bought one of these from our local store about 8 or so years ago.  My 3 year old broke it by losing one of the arms and sadly I was unable to find another like it. I was ecstatic to see it offered as a ""Gold Deal of Day"".  I had not even thought of ordering it on Amazon.  I bought it years ago for $99 and paid 1/2 that this time.  We live in the country with tough, Adobe clay that can be difficult to walk on.  This little tractor rolls over all the gopher holes, etc that find its way into our lawn.  I love that you can adjust the output to include border plants/rose bushes, etc.  It's range of watering and ability to maneuver itself around our yard is what I missed most.  Plus it has an automatic stop at the end if I have to go somewhere and get delayed.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  Definitely a time-saver!  In my world that is GOLDEN!!  Highly recommend."
5.0,"I have only had the sprinkler for 2 weeks.  Works great so far.  The only draw back is that it takes quite some time to water the yard, but we do have a lot of yard."
1.0,"water motor broken after only (1) year of use.
very disappointed and can't find mfg. site to order replacement part"
5.0,"The only thing better than a rain train is an in ground sprinkler system designed specifically for the lawn area its suppose to water. Especially if the area is large with a shape other than rectangular or square.  I have a half acre property and it has to drag  nearly a hundred feet of  hose behind it at any given time. Its work laying out my hose and taking it up to mow the lawn and taking the hose completely up so I don't get yellow lines in the grass.  But my lawn is as green and lush as my neighbors who has an in ground sprinkler system, and he is amazed. Other home owners in my sub-division that don't have in ground sprinkler systems, who also have large properties look like they gave up and just let the grass turn to hay. They may use an oscillating sprinkler at best.

Make sure that the stop block is not in a low spot, always use the anchor pin, and make sure the hose leading into and out of the block is straight.  The rain train is best at negotiating turns that have a large loop in them, not tight turns. It looses it grip in less than solid turf it will get stuck and dig a hole. So lay the hose (track) in solid turf.

Its a work horse and it has moving parts, so everyone knows what that means. I have four of them, and I need to order parts every 2 to 3 years or so! As for the rain train a little maintenance is all that is needed. A drop or two of silicone based lubricant on the stop mechanism is a good thing. The weakest part of the rain train are the recess in the plastic wheels, where the axle drive pins turn the wheel, that is where the force to drive the wheel is applied and the plastic will just round off and wear out over time! Nelson is very good at stocking parts, and they aren't expensive.  At first I thought why don't they reinforce that, but being an engineer I quickly figured out that with what it does there has to be a wear point.  (So don't sweat it)

  I use quick disconnect fittings on all my hose end connections  That lets me quickly connect and disconnect it and allows some swivel so travel on uneven terrain is a little less rigid and stressful. I also use a quick on/off inline stop valve just ahead of the connector.

This lets me start it without having to walk back to the house to turn the water on or off to disconnect it, of course you have to move quickly to get out of the way of the water when starting it, but I find getting a couple of drops on me doesn't kill me, especially on a hot day!

I suggest a premium flexibility hose as well, I use one from home depot, called ""Never Kink"" I have 200 feet in my front yard, and 200 in the back.  With a little care in rolling it up in large loops it never gets a knot in it when pulling it to where I need it.  And the rain train loves following it!"
5.0,Great product. We set up the garden hose and let the tractor do the work. I would recommend this to a friend.
5.0,Very convenient product.  Eliminates the need to continuously change the sprinkler position...but you do have to check it once in a while in case it gets stuck.  It sometimes gets hung up in soft spots in the lawn and begins to dig a hole and remain in the same position ...until you just go and move it.  I use a 200' run and it takes a while to set up the hose correctly.  I love it.  Got the best prices at Amazon !
4.0,"This is an innovative product that is easy to assemble, set up and use.  Really clever design.

The good:

1.  Waters large areas of lawn and eliminates the need to constantly move hoses and sprinklers.
2.  Ease of use.
3.  Auto shutoff
4.  Powered by water pressure.
5.  Adjustable in terms of pattern and amount of water to be added to lawn.
6.  Really good price for what it does.  Appears to have high quality construction and parts.

The bad:

1.  Probably not great for newly seeded lawns.  The weight of the hose will soon be too much for the tractor to pull and it will get stuck in the mud.  It needs the root system of established grass or sod to maintain traction.
2.  Occasionally jumps the guiding hose and goes rogue.  Not sure why.
3.  Rarely shuts off prematurely if a dirt clod or bump is big enough to push the shutoff button.

Overall I am very happy with this item.  It allows you to water a lot of grass without having to move hoses or even be present."
5.0,"I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12"" away from it.

Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.

Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.

Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)

You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.

I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.

I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.

This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I don't want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.

For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This won't ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement."
5.0,"this sprinkler, is a decent buy. it works as intended, and doesnt fall apart, like the cheap ""green machine"" from a well known tractor maker. this one will drag over 100 feet of hose, and keeps right on working. the gears are bronze, not plastic, like the cheap green machine. heavy cast iron body helps it pull and pull and pull. i have had no problems with mine, after a year of continuous use. throws a nice wide path of water, and the 2 speed trans might be helpful, but i always use high speed, which seems really slow."
5.0,works fine...would buy again.
3.0,it fit the hose for the boat- that's all I neeed
4.0,"Works good.  You can feel the cold of the water in the handle, which during cold months makes it uncomfortable to use.  It doesn't feel to be the same quality as the ones from the 1970's but it does the job."
5.0,Excellent.  Won't mess with more expensive plastic ones any more.
4.0,"good hose sprayer,  fits great and  no leaks.  Have only used for 2 months so don't know about how It will hold up. Bought it at good price."
5.0,Works better then any plastic type so far. I have found the plastic in others breaks after a year or two.
5.0,"I actually was impressed with the quality of this sprayer.  I was expecting a cheap metal feel, like some similar ones I've had in the past, but instead it is smooth and has some heft, sprays consistently and without dripping or leaking anywhere.  lt's a very good hose sprayer for the money."
5.0,Works just as I expected with a thin jet stream and wide spray modes. Wouldn't need anything else; great value.
4.0,Would give it five stars if it was made in the USA.  It is not.
5.0,Love this item! It was pretty affordable but its made of really good material.  Simple and durable!
5.0,It was exactly as described.  Loved it.
5.0,"I got these as a wedding present. I love them. They are perfect for gardening. Sharp, reliable, and easy to lock. I have joint problems at the ripe old age of...22. Most locking tools dislocate my fingers due to having Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. These are perfect for anyone with similar struggles."
5.0,"These are great pruning shears, and Fiskars is a great company, guaranteeing their products for life. I have had some snips break on me before, and Fiskars replaced them with no problems. These pruning shears will cut branches up to about an inch thick."
4.0,Good nice
5.0,"Works fine, there are definitely better shears out there, but they come at 4x the cost.  Will see how these hold up after a season of use."
5.0,they are great and great quality...
5.0,These are great. Sharp and get the job done.
5.0,Great product. Great vendor. Holds up well.  I keep a pair in my garage and another in my shed.  I hate looking for clippers when I need to use them.
4.0,works fine just haven't used it much
5.0,Love this thing.  Use it on my motorcycle works great.
5.0,"We had one of these when I grew up and I was more than pleased to find it was still available.  What a great product.  The only thing extra I could ask for is a valve at each end of the sprayer so you could mist plants instead of spraying.  However, that may make it so there is not enough pressure to move the sprinkler around.  Overall, an excellent product."
5.0,"I've owned this item for years.......just bought one as a gift for a friend.  Great watering product minimizing water spray loss while providing effective watering.  Carefree watering after minimal setup effort for desired area. It provides hours of watering without annoyance of constant monitoring to change locations.  Lots of watering done here in Texas with our summer heat.

Someone noted negative of accessibility to tractor's connection point.  Simple fix is to purchase from Home Depot a readily available 6 inch hose adaptor (hose contained within a large spring) which helps to prevent severe bending at connection point and eliminates accessibility problem noted by the other reviewer.

Added Note June, 2015:  Internal transmission gave out and product would not move by itself.  New transmission available for over $30, but I had difficulty removing old trans (which I attempted b4 ordering new part).  Decided just to junk, BUT TO BUY ANOTHER IDENTICAL because the convenience and value of the product is so great.  A little more expensive, but still well worth it !!!

Not perfect.......but hard to find a better valued product to meet the need."
5.0,I've been very happy with the sprinkler. it works just as advertised. it takes a while to make sure that it doesn't jump the hose but overall it works very well. once you figure out how to lay the hose it's excellent.
5.0,"Many years ago I was being driven across Minneapolis and noticed a huge lawn being watered by what looked like tiny farm tractor.  I asked my friend to stop the next time we went that way and sure enough it was a HEAVY cast iron model of a tractor, painted bright yellow. Not only did a standard garden hose fit a standard outlet on the rear of the tractor, the flowing water from a household faucet on the side of the house served as the energy to drive the tractor.  The tractor's the front wheels were engineered to fit snugly on the hose and the tractor stayed over the hose and watered all the way back to the
source where it climbed a small yellow ramp which shut the water off by a plug in the belly of the tractor.  Man, this was every little boy's dream! My own tractor, small enough not to horrify my wife, cute enough to please her and efficient, not to mention inexpensive.  I now have three of them, I'm too lazy to unscrew the hose and haul the tractor to the back yard, and I got one back after some dumb and clumsy thief had
stolen it so I can lazily water my side lawn too. I am so glad that AMAZON sells the books I read while watching my tractor that I also bought from AMAZON - I don't have any cars or tractors in my garage, but I do have about 5000 books - the AMAZON sprinkler lawn tractor lets me glance up from time to time when I'm reading books as my lawn is watered.  NELSON 1865 RAINTRAIN TRAVELING LAWN SPRINKLER."
3.0,"The Raintrain seems to be one of the best walking sprinklers out there and its construction seems quite good.  Its metal body and heavy feel certainly gives it a very sturdy feel.  While the device itself does work well it is not certainly something you can set and forget out of the box.  You lay the hose out and put it at the end of the hose.  It will follow the hose pulling it behind it as it goes until it reaches the stop.  Hopefully your spigot is near the end of the path of where you want it to run otherwise you will obviously have to waste hose getting to where the end will be.  It can make turns but you need to consider a good 5-10 foot radius turns for it to properly follow them.  You will want to use 5/8"" hose to keep it on track and with the power it needs to work really well but that's a small investment.

Now onto the issue,  On the large flat portion of the lawn it did perfect on, it can cover a _large_ area you will primarily be limited by the 200 ft hose cap sadly (keep in mind it ends up having to drag the hose so its not just a water pressure issue).  If you need more area you could not reuse the water hose as the guide hose but rather use a different hose for each.  This would allow for some nicer tricks like leaving the guide hose in place and not having to replace it each time you want to have to water.  This also could allow you to water several areas more rapidly without being limited by the feed hose length (as it doesn't need the feed hose to guide it.  Just keep in mind you are playing a bit with fire, with the device one wrong move and it jumps the guide hose or doesn't hit the stop properly if it runs into something it will burn out the drive system and cost a good bit to fix.

We have several areas of the lawn that are a bit hilly or have some slope and with just about any slope to your lawn it's going to tip over.  If the wheel base was wider it would do far better with slope but right now even something like 10 degrees is probably going to be pushing it.  So if you have any slope you will almost certainly want to avoid this product."
1.0,"I have owned one of these for about 20 years and it finally just wore out.  I always loved the design and found it very practical for the shape of my lawn.  So I bought a new one, but have been very disappointed.  Every once in a while the tractor jumps off the hose, which is understandable.  However, if it runs into something solid (like a tree or the house) and the back wheels can't turn very well, the teeth on the main nylon gear strip off and the tractor won't move anymore.  You can buy a new plastic motor from Nelson but it gets to be frustrating and expensive.  It has happened three times now, simply because the tractor drove off the hose.  I have done an autopsy on the motor and it looks to me like the main drive gear is poorly constructed.  The teeth on the main gear appear to be peeled off, like they were poorly attached to the hub.  I would not buy this product again unless they address the gear issue.  I am really disappointed because I really like the overall design but would like it to be more reliable."
5.0,The sprinkler was delivered quickly. I opened it up everything was packaged in the original box with warrenty instrctions. The sprinkler works perfectly.
1.0,"i set up the product as per instructions.  Turned on the water, and let is start running... within 10 feet and 10 minutes in quite running,  When I checked it out, after a hour or so of internet research, found that it had stripped the gears in it that were made in CHINA.... EXTREAMLY POOR QUALITY......."
5.0,this product is easy to use and works great! I got it to water my yard and it works great! I just set out my hose and the tractor does the rest!
5.0,"We had our first travel sprinkler more than 40 years ago when we first purchased our home.  It lasted many years, but eventually wore out.  We replaced it with a sprinkler system and have tried many different type sprinklers from the big box stores.  This sprinkler is now adjustable which makes it even better for complete coverage."
5.0,Great for dogs! They can't eat this one :). Works wonderfully too!
4.0,I have had such issues with more expensive nozzles leaking and being generally horrible that when I received this -and it worked without leaking- that I've never changed any adjustment.
5.0,"Excellent for washing your vehicle, the variable spray pattern trigger can get you the correct spray pattern in a second depending on if your spraying down your paint, or need a jet for spraying down your wheels. Also good for garden."
5.0,"No nonsense, good quality spray nozzle.  With the grip of the lever you can spray a cone or a stream."
5.0,Works great. Pretty standard. It feels cheaper then I expected. But works just the same. If it brakes I will come back and update.
5.0,Solid project. Light weight . Water stream varies depending on how firm you hold the handle.
5.0,"old-time classic... yes it's cheap metal, BUT it's METAL... a must for the dry-side of the nation where the UV eats plastic and ABS nearly instantaneously...

Hose handles are NOT made out of IRON, treat it with some RESPECT and it will last you a good bit better than the plastic stuff... don't just toss it around like a rag-doll and it will last you...."
4.0,"These simple spray nozzles can be locked in the open position which was the main selling point for me.  I can lay the nozzle in an animal watering bucket out in the pasture, let it fill while I do something else, then shut it off when the bucket is filled without having to go all the way back to the faucet by the house.

The stream varies from mist to solid, depending on how much you squeeze the handle.  In the locked position it's a solid stream.  The stream can be calibrated by the twisting bass knob, but I haven't needed to.

The external parts are all metal, so I don't have to worry about the nozzle rotting in the sun, but the quality clearly isn't top notch.  As you can see in the photo, within a few month's of use the coating on the handle has chipped off and the handle has started to rust."
5.0,Perfect little hose nozzle at a great price.
5.0,Shoots very far; surprisingly far; good value
5.0,These work great!  Why did I never have a pair before!!  Love them.
5.0,just want i wanted.
3.0,I like the grip and use of the shears - but they are not as sharp as I'd like. Dead heading my petunias was a bit of a hassle with them.
5.0,Great clippers and easy to handle.  A simple push of a button and they open is still nice. They're lightweight and very
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"Use them all the time now, good clean cuts"
2.0,"After wearing out 2 pairs of a competitor product, I decided to try these Fiskars, which, given their reputation, I had high hopes for. I just used them for the 1st time for about 30 minutes. They will be going back as they completely underwhelmed my expectations. I used them to trim my young redbud trees (a softwood) lower limbs.
1) They did not seem to be very sharp when I fist removed them from the package.
2) The rubber handle cover started coming off when in use. I could put it back on, but it came off again for the next branch trim.
3) The blades became very dull and nicked quickly, until they became very difficult to use. Please see my pictures."
5.0,"Comfortable to use. Makes a clean cut. Locks and unlocks with ease. Lasts forever. ( I've had mine 7 years now) Bought a pair for my dad. He now has two pair (one is a different brand) and is always searching for these and calls them ""the good pair""."
5.0,Perfect !!!
4.0,Smith easy cut
1.0,"I bought this because of all the good reviews here on Amazon. It worked great for 1 week. Then it started leaking a huge amount of water out the bottom and didn't have enough pressure coming out the sprayer to keep it going.

I took it apart to try and find the problem. I was surprised that only the front body of the sprinkler is metal. The entire rear assembly, including the housing, wheels, gears, and all internal parts are made from cheap plastic. The molded housing that connects the water from the hose coupling (on the outside) to the sprayer (on the inside) had cracked and split, allowing the water to leak out inside the sprinkler.

It was apparent from the damage that the housing had cracked from some force on the hose coupling. I have been very gentle with this sprinkler, and not abused it, or torqued it by the hose. Most likely it was from the force of dragging the 100' hose around, which is what it's supposed to do."
1.0,Originally I gave this rave reviews. It worked great at the start. Loved it. Got a lot of attention too. People liked watching it. About a month after starting to use it the transmission on it broke. It watered yes but did not move down the hose as it is supposed to. Contacted Nelson and was told to send the old transmission at my expense to them so they could check it out and see if I did the damage or if it was faulty. I ended up ordering another transmission for it from another company that sold the Nelson parts as I was going to be paying either way. Just thought this would be quicker. A true hassle to take old one off and put on new one. Fast forward a month or so and once again the transmission issue again. Called Nelson. Said they were looking into it and would call back as since I was canadian they needed to get someone else to talk to me. Still waiting for that call a month or so later. Bye bye Nelson.
1.0,"I have had Nelson raintrain sprinklers for years, and in the past I had nothing but good things to say, but now that the new Bosch company has taken over I will NEVER buy anything from them again. The last time I had to buy a transmission for my tractor, it was 2008, and it cost $13.00. I just ordered a transmission last month, and in 3 weeks it has already broke, so I called them like I had in the past when I had a problem with a replacement part, in a nutshell, I was treated terribly, told I was out of luck that I would have to purchase another transmission.  ITS ONLY BEEN 3 TO 4 WEEKS!!  They are terrible!!!  On top of that it cost me $24.00 and $9.00 in shipping.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  If you are from the BOSCH company you should be ashamed of yourself.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It is cheap china junk now."
5.0,"My property is at the beginning of a cul-de-sac and it makes my yard twice as large as most the houses in my area.  Because of the large wedge I would have to move any stationary sprinkler at least half a dozen times to get all the areas.  With the RAIN TRAIN and a 100 foot hose, I can cover the yard in one sweep.  It followed the hose around the curve no problem for me and the shutoff valve worked at the end. The only issue I had was that the shut off valve was activated half way through the sprinklers course.  Maybe our new sod is too deep (the valve is on the underside and hover's just above the hose) but it only happened once so I'm not concerned.
I have to say it was easy to put together and was impressed by how far it throws the water.  I seriously was expecting to have to run it twice, once farther from the house and once closer to get reach everything, and was pleasantly suprised when I had set it up farther away and it still reached the grass by the house."
4.0,"This is a good little sprinkler. We live on a five acre lot and want to water about an acre with little effort and even less cost.  I remembered that my parents had a couple of these that they use to water their lawns.  For around sixty dollars it's a good buy.  Sure there is a bit more work involved then there would be if I were to put in a auto sprinkler system.  Yet for a few minutes a week I can keep my lawn just as green for a fraction of the cost.

Now a couple of things that I figured out that may be helpful.

1. If you are using more then a hundred feet of hose don't use any thing more then 1/2 inch. in diameter.  It will cause to much drag. This is one of those cases where cheaper is better.  Two Fifteen dollar, seventy five foot hoses seemed to be the best for the machine.

2. If you have low water pressure (as I do) you will want to be sure that you water when it is the only thing that will be running.

3. If it is traversing uneven ground it is best to be going either straight up or better yet down hill.  If you allow it to turn and travel on a incline it will skip off the hose.  I would suggest that the designers add a mechanism that could shut it off when this occurs.

4. Allow it to make wide turns.  To tight of a turn will result in a derailment.

5. This is a no brainier but the shut off ramp only shuts it off a the sprinkler.  My son was unaware of this fact and left the tap on for several hours after it had stopped.  This led us to the discovery that our tap wasn't very good.

I am very happy with this product and will be buying another soon.  It is reasonably priced and a great value."
4.0,"I purchased my 1865 traveling sprinkler in April of 2012.  I have used it twice in the front yard and twice in the back.  I am not completely satisfied with it, but consider it generally good at what it does and it still has novelty for me to watch it chugging around.  There was no issue with it arriving in good new condition and having a very easy set up.  The directions are minimal but it is quite obvious how it works.  I have a lot of 5/8 inch hose and it will dutifully follow the hose around my yard. When I have several lengths of hose and to help it out after a while, I pull it up more behind the unit to reduce the effort it has to snake the length of hose along.  I think about an 8 foot radius curve is the tightest it can turn in my situation (very tall grass) without coming off the hose track.

I had a lot of problems with it turning itself off.  So I had to disable the bottom valve whose only function that I know of is to turn the unit off at the end of the run when it hits the little plastic ramp.  I would rather just turn it off manually. Just be sure it doesn't stop on anything and start spinning its wheels or the gearbox may break. The spray arms are fully adjustable and it is not possible to be consistent in their placement.  The speed selector has neutral in the middle, high and low on the sides.  Took getting my glasses on to figure out why it wouldn't go. At the high speed setting, it goes too fast to put down the inch of water I want, but the lower speed does a better watering job.  I guess we have high water pressure here, because I don't understand the reviews that thought it didn't put out enough water.  Because the unit is rather heavy and time consuming to carry it back to the starting point and replace the hose where you want it, we try to get the necessary water on one run.  I know there are better, more expensive versions of this but so far so good.  It is easier and cheaper than putting in an underground system with pop-ups and we can't do that anyway here because of winter freeze.  I find moving stationary sprinklers to be too much work for me, and leaving hoses down in the same place can quickly kill the grass beneath.  This unit goes some way toward applying water around on my yard and plantings where I need it.  Note -- this is only for flat, well-established yards."
2.0,None of the descriptions of this product mentioned that it doesn't work on new lawns- just the instructions after I bought it- it gets boggged down in the wet dirt and runs off the hose easily- I will try again once I establish the grass but so far I am disappointed.
4.0,"Only gave 4 stars due to the fact that the wheels and gears are all plastic, only the body and spray arms are metal (not surprised, just not impressed). I will update later after a Texas summer.

I purchased this to water a section of my lawn that is 80ft long by 40ft wide. It covers the area no problem. I used a separate 50ft hose as a guide for the tractor not connected to water or the tractor (it was on sale for $6). This made setting up the tractor very easy as I didn't have to spend as much time laying out the route each time. I would highly recommend doing it this way since it is so cheap and cuts down on the hassle of laying out a route.

I set the tractor to low speed and set my route. It took 3 hours to travel the 50 feet of hose on flat ground. Never got hung up or off course. It put out the exact amount of water I was looking for, very wet just not puddles. I did have to set the spray arms to the 30* angle to get the 40ft of coverage desired, product says it will cover 55ft, maybe in a perfect world.

All in all I would suggest this to anyone with a large straight area that is looking for an efficient sprinkler and doesn't mind buying a separate hose for the guide."
5.0,This was exactly what my husband was looking for. He already had one and wanted another one so he could water all of our lawn at the same time. We have had other sprinklers in the past but this is the only one he will use now. Worth the investment!
4.0,"The Rain Train works great on established grass. It doesn't work on new seeding, but the manual tells you that. Great product. If only it could start up and reverse course the next day."
4.0,Works good.
5.0,"Just like the hose nozzle grandma used to have! After repeatedly breaking nozzles by dropping them after their use.... I mean seriously....Who has time to wash a vehicle and set the hose over in the lawn.... Nope, wash and drop. I've been using this hose for the last couple of months and it has never failed. I highly recommend it. It's simple, durable and just what I was looking for."
3.0,"I don't remember using this yet. I bought it to use on a hose I seldom use, so I think it is still sitting out on my front porch somewhere waiting to be used. If it is like the same brand and model it is replacing it should be okay and last a very long time. That is why I bought it, to replace one I have for about 5 seasons that I used outside. The one I just received was metal and seems as sturdy as they one like it that I replaced it for. The one I had before took quite a few years before it started to leak when I sprayed with it. This is a cheap cost hose but if like the other one it should be good?"
5.0,Gets hot in the sun f y I
5.0,"Have had this for about a year now.  I have beaten it up pretty good, but it has only cosmetic damage, still works just as good as it did the first day."
5.0,Works just fine.
5.0,"This is a beautifully simple hose nozzle, and what makes it perfect is that it's solid, enameled metal that I believe will last for ages. Pull the lever and the spray opens or closes. There aren't many moving parts, so what you get is a functional nozzle without the fus. No frills. Just right."
4.0,Not as heavy and well built as they use to be. But better then others I have bought
5.0,These are hard to find in a brick and mortar place.... so I ordered several and am very pleased. Far superior to plastic. It's just your basic nozzle and performs as it should.
5.0,This beats the cheap plastic ones hands down.
5.0,"A++ all the way  great price, great item, awesome communication,  Product packaging was great  not a lousy pouch was in a good amazon box and seems to be on top of it all !!"
5.0,"We had a drought this year and low water pressure. We obtained three of these. The sprinkler sprays fifty feet and covers the ground really well. The sprinkler stays on the hose well also.  These are great and other than having to move the hose once per  cycle, I like it better than my built in sprinkler system for good coverage."
5.0,"I know this is not the only self propelled sprinkler on the market, but the idea of it is absolutely ingenious!  I have a long and narrow back yard, and this is perfect!  I set the sprinkler at one end and then come back 45 minutes later to see that the tractor has made it all the way to the other end (about 60 feet) and shut itself off automatically.  I've experimented with having the tractor make a turn, and as long as you use common sense and apply a reasonable turn radius, it performs without a hitch.  It might take some trial and error, but you can't fault the product if you set it up to fail.  You can adjust the sprinkler heads to throw the water over a wide or narrow range.

This is obviously an expensive item compared to cheap plastic stationary sprinklers, but the practicality and novelty of this sprinkler make it well worth the money to me.  Rather than setting up 3-4 sprinkers or having to manually move one sprinkler 3-4 times and then remembering to turn it off, I can just set this one and forget about it without wasting water.  After you figure out the correct turning radius and know there are no obstacles that might make it turn over, you can confidently set it and forget it.

The quality of the item is very high.  In fact, I was amazed at how heavy it was and how it could still propel itself along just from water pressure.

I would definitely recommend!  I just wish there were some other colors to choose from."
1.0,"This sprinkler worked great for the first two months, watering large areas of the yard a traveling along the hose as I had hoped, only occasionally jumping the ramp where I placed it.  On one occasion, it jumped the ramp and ran until it hit the fence.  When a couple of the interior plastic gears stripped out, it was a very quick decline when the remaining plastic gears stripped out and it became a stationary sprinkler.  Now, it's useless and in the garbage.  Design would be drastically improved with metal gears."
5.0,"If you have an odd shaped yard or a lot of area to cover this sprinkler works great. It is quite durable, and not too hard to find replacement parts.

Cons:
1. You may have to baby sit it until you get the feel for how to lay out your water hose.
2. If it gets off track and runs into something, the gears in the drive train can get stripped or break. You have to buy the whole drive train assembly to repair.

Pros:
1. Very durable
2. You can cover a wide variety of terrain, by adjusting the angle of the arms.
3. Its cool."
5.0,"Covers a wide area without the need of high water pressure.  I runs through 30-50feet in about 1hr dropping about 1/4 inch.  It's a little expensive but I can see the quality of the built and durability.

It's definitely not necessary to get this for a lawn smaller than 2,000 sq-ft but if you are lazy like I and don't want to move your sprinklers around, this one should do it for you."
5.0,Great sprinkler does not miss a beat great coverage the only bad if not in grass it won't pull it self got to keep the hose length short
4.0,"Product as described. Quick shipping. Very satisfied with product, transaction and shipping time. Only used twice before the rains of fall hit but anxious for next summer.  No qualms that it will perform as produced."
5.0,I am rating this product five stars even though I am having trouble with it jumping track.  I think I have figured it out and will continue adjusting it.  My yard is somewhat uneven and a little hilly in places.  On the straight of way it does great and waters deeply even on high speed.  I love the fact you can put it in neutral to water an odd spot not on the hose route.  All in all it does a very good job.
5.0,"I bought this a few years back thinking this isn't going to work, HA!!!! Ive purchased fan sprinklers, standup sprinklers that make a lot of noise and out of everything I have purchased over the few years...... This IS the ONLY thing that actually works and keeps working! Well worth every penny!!!!!"
4.0,Fit comfortable in hand and very sharp.
5.0,"These little shears are the perfect tool for the hobby gardener. We use them regularly in our herb and vegetable garden to trim back vines, small branches, and vegetable plants that are getting a little out of control. They are excellently manufactured and seem to be built to last. The handle grips are comfortable without being too soft. The blade seems to be retaining its sharpness with regular use. As other users have pointed out, these do seem to work better on living or ""Green"" wood as opposed to hardened branches. The lock function lets us store these in our garden bag without fear of reaching in a slicing open a hand.

Make sure to keep the blades clean to prevent build up and rust.

These are a great product from a trusted brand! I have no hesitation recommending these to anyone."
5.0,"Work very well, much better than my old pair."
5.0,Sharp and great in your hand. Cuts through so many stems!
5.0,Use everyday-holding up well
5.0,"I have a pair of these pruners and find they work well for pruning heavier woody stems, shrubbery, and the like. Very robust and well made, I have not had any issues described by some of the other reviewers such as the handle covers coming off or the lock breaking. They do need to be cared for to avoid rusting, but other than that I have found they work well and are very comfortable in the hand for heavy work.

The blades seem well sharpened from the manufacturer and are not inclined to bend or warp when tackling heavier pruning. They should be cleaned after each use and sharpened as needed."
5.0,"I LOVE THESE BYPASS CLIPPERS, THEY ARE SHARP ENOUGH TO CUT THROUGH THE VERY TOUGH WASHINGTON HAWTHORNE HEDGES, SO I FEEL THEY CAN CUT ANY AND EVERYTHING.
THEY ARE VERY HIGH QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE. BUY THEM, IF A 62 YEAR OLD WOMAN CAN TRIM W. Hawthorne HEDGES THAT ARE 12 FEET HIGH, YOU CAN CUT EVERYTHING THAT YOU BUY THEM TO CUT!"
5.0,Exactly what I needed
5.0,that's all you need
5.0,The price was excellent and arrived quickly.
3.0,Received Heavy Duty instead of Medium and was promised a correct replacement and was again sent Heavy Duty. Paid for only one. Told not to return original.
5.0,Functional. Doing what it is supposed to do and doing it well.
3.0,"Worked well for a while, but cracked after having it a year."
5.0,"This is a great, basic, very SOLID hose handle.  Seals up great, screws on tight, does not drip anywhere, and gives you what ever stream you want with a nice analog approach.  You could back over this thing in your driveway and it would be fine.  Try that with a plastic handle."
5.0,"Fantastic nozzle. It can be used as a wide softer spray, or as an ultra powerful jet. It has worked great for basting off yard debris, and rinsing my hands alike."
5.0,my old one broke down this works real nice
5.0,A great product at a great price along with fast delivery. What more can a customer ask for?
5.0,The BEST FOR THE MONEY
5.0,Good for non-serious pressure washer. I use it to clean off the porch from dirt and leaves. Effectively cleaned sheetrocking materials too.
5.0,"Good quality, working like its supposed to. Using for a couple months now and still looks new."
4.0,"The Nelson Rain Train does exactly what it says it does. Some of the functionality has been modified for the better compared to older versions that I have used. So if you are researching rain trains this one is the best and they are worth the cost. However the only con with it is my yard. I have the typical quarter acre lot with a lot of naturally curved landscaping which takes up about half of the entire yard. So not to the fault of the rain train, there ends up being a lot of tight turns with the hose which it does not handle well. I found that using a larger diameter hose or contractor grade hose helps. Also my yard is not flat. This sometimes causes the auto shutoff to engage which is annoying. But all in all if you have a basic lawn with simple landscaping, these are awesome. If your yard is anything like mine, still get it, but anticipate the need to get a little bit creative."
4.0,"It's a little top-heavy.  I wish the back wheels were just about an inch or two wider.  Otherwise, I love it."
5.0,"This thing is awesome.  Its doesn't have cast iron wheels like the older ones, but the fact that it moves and waters and turns itself off, are you kidding me?  I've used it for a couple of weeks now and my grass is looking great. I'd  recommend this sprinkler, to anyone that either doesn't have a sprinkler system, or doesn't have adequate coverage(as a supplement during the drier months of summer)"
5.0,"Amazing tool for watering gardens; it follows the hosepipe unnervingly. The front wheel can climb over the hosepipe if the trailing pipe is too much to one side.

This is the best tool on the market; rugged, heavy and easy to set going. Why oh why cannot we get them in England?

BTW try to avoid the ""Sprinkler Sydrome"", that is watching the facination of the sprinkler in action, I've spent ages just watching it."
2.0,"The Raintain Traveling Sprinkler worked great when I received it in early June.  I used it a couple of times a week off and on throughout the summer, but last week it stopped working.  It lasted about three months before the gears stripped out.  Not a very good lifespan for the money I paid for it. Will I buy another? No.  I guess I'll go back to moving my sprinkler or paying more for something that will actually last longer than 3 months.  I loved how I could make it cover such large expanses of the yard by simply directing the hose where I need the sprinkler to do its work."
5.0,"I have had this sprinkler for 2 1/2 years, and it still works great.  It has gotten stuck in the mud, not moved, for who knows how long before I noticed, its tipped over on its side, and yet it still works.  I was worried about the gears getting stripped from other reviews, but it hasn't happened.

It keeps chugging along.

After 2 1/2 years in the californa sun, it has faded, and the yellow is almost white.

The ONLY con I can see is that, neither my teenage children or myself, can pull the plunger on the bottom out by hand, once it has been depressed.  It is really stuck there & with the wetness its hard to hold, we just use a pair of pliers, and it comes out nicely.

Would I buy this again, absolutely I love this sprinkler.  Would I recommend it to others?  I have many, many times."
4.0,"I was almost certain this was a gimmick, or maybe even a toy. It's quite the contrary. The Raintrain gets the job done. The sprinkler is a substantial piece of hardware, almost heavy. But it propels itself along your given path just fine.

I'm quite satisfied, except for the arm that comes off. I just jammed it back in at first, but it has come off again since. It's hopefully nothing a dab of super glue can't handle.

P.S.
It doesn't like slopes either. Leave it on the fast setting to handle some gentle slopes."
5.0,so far good product works like i expected it to.  a  little heavy to carry around for an old lady
1.0,"I bought this Nelson Raintrain after borrowing a neighbor's for several months.  I thought I knew it would work for my lawn, since my neighbor's sprinkler worked for my lawn.  I was wrong.  There are apparently several design changes, but most importantly, this one will not stay on its track the way the neighbor's does.  If I walk away for 15 minutes, I come back to find it happily digging holes a few feet away from the hose track.  The only way I would recommend buying this sprinkler is if you can go back in time and buy one when my neighbors did."
3.0,"I see why this product is rated either very good or very bad.  It is obvious that it will get a 4 or 5 star until you are unfortunate enough to strip the gears.  I used my first unit for 2 or 3 seasons without problems, too bad it was stolen out of my front yard.  My second was a John Deere (functionally exactly the same) and didn't last one season.  Yep, stripped gears.  Disassembly revealed a worn plastic worm gear, all others looked OK.  Unfortunately you can't buy just one gear, and the package deal cost $25 plus shipping.  I might be more forgiving if replacement parts were easier to aquire.  Bottom line:  It's a great product if you NEVER let the unit stall, or get stuck before it shuts off. That means layout is very important--don't give it any chance to bog down, jump the hose or run in to anything.  Even the auto-off platform can sometimes derail it and it winds up in your garden or up against a brick wall.  This is why it gets a 3 star--an average of one and 5."
4.0,Not as sharp as one would hope but does the job.
5.0,"I just got this pruning shears the other day, and man, I like it already. It's super sharp. It makes pruning so easy."
5.0,"Love them.  They get the job done.  Bought in 2015. The small orange plastic slide lock came off and I couldn't find it.  They still work of course but cant be locked in the closed position.  I contacted them and asked for another plastic pc.  OMGosh they sent a whole new shear!!!!  I didn't expect that!  I have 2 other products made by Friskars.  I lost a spring on another small set of shears and they fixed that too,  no questions asked!  Great company"
2.0,They don't snap back open after pruning a branch. I finally quit using them after tiring of always having to push them back open. Wish I had returned them.
5.0,These are amazingly sharp and definitely a good buy. I love how sturdy they are!
5.0,works great thank you
5.0,Top notch! High quality and sharp!
4.0,"These work fine for light pruning. They are not the same as they were years ago, but it seems nothing is. Can you even buy quality anymore?"
5.0,"LOVE these pruners; by far the best pruners I have used in a while. Only drawback is that if you use them to aggressively attack a vine which has been overgrowing for YEARS, the handle coating worked its way loose and I almost lost it in the pile of debris!"
5.0,Good product
5.0,"waters 100' at a time about 30' wide at my water pressure.
water a narrow strip along my driveway without wasting water on cement."
2.0,"I have used these sprinklers for quite a few years but have struggled with removing the axle caps for the last time to change out the housing. The screw drive seems to be very inferior to what they once were. If you miss catching the sprinkler when it doesn't make a curve and it runs against an obstacle it is mostly shot.

Too bad Nelson don't make the gears as solid as the body itself. Might cost more but would be worth it. I am going to buy the all metal traveling sprinkler next."
4.0,Great value for the price. Very fast delivery. Does everything as advertised. Only improvement would be to have adjustable spray tips on the arms similar to tank sprayer wands. This would give better coverage especially when used in stationary positions.
5.0,This is the second time I purchased one of these.  First one was at a different location and I sold it at a garage sale not needing it any more.  After moving into a new house with no sprinkle system I tried many ways to water my yard before I remember about this little gem.  I love it and it puts a smile on everyones face who sees it traveling across my yard.  My grand baby love it and like to play in the water.  Best way to water your yard short of a built in sprinkler system.  Can't put one in to many roots at this location.
5.0,It was very easy to assemble and we can rely on it to do exactly what it's supposed to do. My husband and I are very pleased with this sprinkler.  We have a large yard so we bought a second one so we can get all the sprinkling done even quicker. We wish we had bought it sooner. The reviews we read on Amazon helped us make our initial choice of sprinklers there.
4.0,"I tried other sprinklers from gilmore and they worked for about an hour, took them back and got this one from nelson...no probs...about 30.00 cheaper"
1.0,"I was VERY disappointed with the Nelson 1865 Raintrain. Every one I know that has one of these has nothing but good things to say about them. For myself, the second time I used it I noticed it was clicking and it would go forward and then fall backward. It was literally taking 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Hopefully this was just the one bad one of the lot. I do apprciate amazon.com having an easy to execute exchange policy. I am just hoping I will get my $17.80 back for shipping this product back to them. If not, I won't be back. If yes, I will be back."
5.0,"I had one of these for 20 years before it finally broke and I had to replace it with the new one.  I love the lawn coverage it provides and it is very easy to use.  It doesn't cost much more than a regular sprinkler so if you have a large area to water, I don't see why you wouldn't try this one out."
5.0,"I have had this for over a month now. I set this out a night on the lo speed and it runs all night and soaks the ground. I wake up and my yard is watered.
I use it during the day also. It works great."
5.0,As expected..great sprinkler
5.0,Well made. Includes washer. Seals tight. Well built for the price. Works as expected
5.0,"I have went thru several cheap hose nozzles, and a few not so cheap ones. I've had this one for awhile now, and it is a keeper. Strong stream and seems pretty durable. Highly recommend."
4.0,Good
5.0,"Simple, tough, powerful, adjustable quality unit. Much better than the colorful plastic junk out there."
3.0,These function well with high pressure water volume which I like. It disappoints me as to how soon they will begin to rust even though they are still functioning well.
5.0,"EXACTLY what i wanted.  I remember having one of these as a kid.  Got tired of plastic ones breaking every other year (or every time it got dropped)...

Stoney's review really says it all."
3.0,Nothing special. It works
5.0,"I bought two of these. The Wife was tired of our cracked, hard water discolored old spray one. I love that there are only to settings.
One is Shower mode
Two, move or I'll make a hole on ya!!! Very powerful stream!! LOL
Very well made, now let see how long they last. ^_^"
5.0,"I find that the spray nozzles that have a rotating head wear out and leak.  This design is simple, effective, and built to last.

It works great, and at maximum pressure delivers a surprisingly strong stream of water.  This is very helpful for keeping the chickens' waterers clean.

Very glad that I bought this."
1.0,The handle broke and now water sprays out of the cracks. Unfortunate
5.0,as expected
2.0,"They clip well, but you have to open the blades between every cut.....pretty annoying"
5.0,Another excellent product by Fiskars.
4.0,Replaced my old pair which broke after 10 years. I'd give 5 stars if the original pair had lasted longer.
4.0,"Blades are nicked and not smooth, making for a clunky close. Had to sharpen before use. But works as expected. I like the locking mechanism."
5.0,These are MUCH better than a pair of shears from another brand that I received as a gift. Truly made me appreciate this product. I use this whenever I can for the convenience. Previously I only used two-handed shears for everything. This saves me a lot of time every weekend.
5.0,Great buy
5.0,"Fiskars shears are reliable, long lasting products.  I had my sewing shears for 35+ years before I broke the handles.  A trusted brand in my home and classroom."
5.0,"> Just about the perfect pruning shears.
> Cuts cleanly through branches up to about 1/2"", albeit that takes a strong grip.
>  If your grip is weak, or you want to cut thicker branches I suggest  short loppers such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fiskars-15-Inch-PowerGear-Super-Pruner-Lopper-7972/dp/B00004SD73/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fiskars 15 Inch PowerGear Super Pruner/Lopper (7972)</a>&nbsp;or ratcheting pruning shears such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Drive-Ratchet-Pruning-Shears-Ideal-Garden-Hedge-Tree-Clippers-Ratcheting-Hand-Secateurs-and-Tree-Pruners-Provide-More-Cutting-Power-Than-Conventional-Anvil-Pruning-Hand-Tools-and-Garden-Scissors/dp/B00CH9TS9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Drive Ratchet Pruning Shears - Ideal Garden Hedge & Tree Clippers - Ratcheting Hand Secateurs and Tree Pruners Provide More Cutting Power Than Conventional Anvil Pruning Hand Tools and Garden Scissors</a>
> For easiest  and longest use, keep the blades dry and oiled.  WD-40 spray is the easiest method -- it not only oils the shears, it also displaces any moisture.
> Eventually (years or hundreds of uses) the (top) blade will get loose and the pruner will not cut so well.  Just tighten the upper bolt, test, tighten some more, etc. until the blades close tightly, but the blades will still open when you release your grip
> CONS:  I find only one shortcoming I can find is that there is no easy way to attach a lanyard---so, no easy way to hang the pruning shears from a hook---or with a carabineer from a belt loop.

PRUNERS vs LOPPERS
> Normally, pruners are best for stems and branches up to "" diameter, and loppers are best for branches greater than "" diameter.  In between, other consideration come into play.
> Pruners are used 1-handed, loppers are used 2-handed.  If you need to hold a stem or branch while you cut, or you want to collect the cut stems as you work, a pruner is your best choice.  Loppers are less tiring if you are cutting alot of thick stems, particularly if you have a weak grip for some reason.  Loppers (particularly extendable handle loppers) give you far more reach, so that you don't have to bend over, or resort to a ladder.  The reach can also help protect you from the thorns of roses, etc.

OTHER DESIGN OPTIONS:  Unless you have a specific reason to choose another design, pruning shears should be simple and bypass in design.  The choices are more complex for loppers.
BYPASS vs ANVIL:  Bypass pruners are analogous to scissors, with two blades which move past one another.  Anvil pruners are analogous to a cleaver and cutting board, with 1 blade and an anvil to which the blade cuts.  Bypass pruners usually cut more cleanly with less crushing, which is usually better for the plant.  Anvil loppers may not easily cut completely through very fibrous stems.  Anvil pruners are less likely to jam and flex, and do not require adjustment.
SIMPLE vs COMPOUND, GEARED, or RACHET:  Geared, compound, and rachet designs give you more leverage, but that usually is not desirable in pruning shearsbut either requiring you to open the shears wider, or squeeze them multiple times to cut through a stem.  For small or easily-cut stems, simple pruning shears are easier and less tiring to use.

5.0,Love these. Very sturdy. Great quality
5.0,"I just bought my second Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler.  I love it and it works just as well as my first which I had for years before my brother inherited it.  Before I bought my 2nd Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler, I bought a traveling sprinkler by Orbit hoping that it would work just as well.  The Orbit travelling sprinkler was a cheap knock-off and the nozzle for the garden hose broke off after only 4 uses.  Do not mess with the Orbit traveling sprinkler.  Stick with the Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler.

The Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler is great for watering a large area.  I use it to water my back yard which is 50 feet wide.  I have the sprinkler arms adjusted to throw the water out 25 feet on each side so I can do it in one straight pass."
1.0,"We've had a Nelson Rain Train for years. Each one lasted for years. We are on our third one. The others worked like a charm. The front wheels were heavy metal as were all working parts. Now we have purchased a real pain. It's hard to believe they could cheapen it so badly. We never know whether it is on or off since it will turn itself off for a blade of grass. It doesn't stay on track so we never know where it might have transported itself. We can't leave it alone for a minute. Now, after reading some reviews, we understand it might strip its gears at any point. Should have read the reviews before we bought but thought we were getting the previous quality."
5.0,"I had a friend recommend this product and I was a little skeptical to spend almost $50 for a sprinkler.  After getting it, I have to say this is the best sprinkler on the market.  It's not as easy as having an automated sprinkler system, but it's a heck of a lot cheaper and takes almost no effort to set up and let it run.  The one thing to be careful of is having too sharp of bends for it to go around...then it jumps the hose and you have no idea where it's headed.  If you want a sprinkler and don't want to be outside moving it every 20 minutes, check this one out."
5.0,"This is one well built spinkler.  Made is USA from an American company. That's great.
I bet the guys at the factory drive in cars from American company's too, not stinking toyotas."
5.0,"This sprinkler is great!  I can turn the ""wands"" to cover small or large areas.  I am thinking of buying another one, so I can have one running in the front yard while one does my back yard."
5.0,This sprinkler is awesome!  It works as advertised -- walking and watering our yard much better and more efficiently than any human in our household could.
5.0,"This is one of those inventions you marvel at.  It solves two problems most people have watering their lawns.
1.) Moving the darn thing around your lawn.  2.) Turning it off.
Well...
1.) It moves itself wherever you want it to go.  2.) It turns itself off.
Plus it's adjustable in distance and speed.  This thing is awesome and the inventor deserves the Nobel Peace Prize."
3.0,"We put sod down this summer. You always have to keep it watered heavily until it takes hold. However, we have had really hot and dry conditions. So, we bought this thinking it would help us water without having to constantly move the sprinkler.

It did travel along the hose as advertised. We laid out the hose making sure that we didn't make the corners too sharp when changing direction. For the most part, it would make the turn. Then, for some reason, it started jumping the hose. Since we weren't watching its every move, it would wind up flipping over or hitting against a part of the landscaping. As a result, there was a clicking noise. Well, we figured out what that was. It was the plastic gears inside breaking. So, in less than two weeks, we put this sprinkler away and got the cheap $3 sprinkler heads from Walmart. We attached hoses to each head and have been successful watering that way.

The idea is nice. If the manufacturer would just make the internal mechanism metal instead of plastic, there would be great improvement. Also, they should consider making the front wheel curve a little more to ""hold"" on to the hose.

You can buy more drive train mechanisms. However, at $15/piece, you would want to make sure to watch the sprinkler to ensure the same doesn't happen. Either that or you could just multiple mechanisms knowing they are going to break at some point."
3.0,"I used one of these my parents had last fall to establish my new grass.  It worked great but I am almost sure it had an American flag that said ""made in America"".  So I bought one , but my new one says Made in China.  I was disappointed.  Also, when I told my father I bought one he told me he had bought two -- the first one's gears were stripped."
4.0,"We recently ordered a Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler. It was shipped and delivered within the allotted shipment time. We've used it several times and find it works just great. Although very new, so far, we have been very pleased with the purchase and hope it will last many years."
5.0,Nice sprayer
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for in a spray nozzle.  Most you find at the store these days are made of cheap plastic that either falls apart, leaks, or ends up cracking!  This one is metal, and has a good solid feel in your hands.  The included rubber washer has a good seal on my hose and doesn't leak, even at full pressure.  I get a good stream of water, and can vary the flow easily to a fine wide mist easily.

Seems like everything is made in China these days in an effort to make the cheapest product possible.  That's a shame and it can make finding good quality products at a decent price point pretty difficult.  Overall, I have to say I'm really quite pleased with this purchase. Good price and quality do still exist!"
5.0,"So far this strong handle has lived up to its reputation.  It is simple, works beautifully and is perfect for my garden use."
4.0,"It is an all metal spray nozzle that sprays well. Nice transisition from off to full spray, nice mist to full stream jet. Nice having the threaded attachment on the end, I have a spray wand and a lawn treatment can that I can hook up to it and works fine."
5.0,Great
1.0,Terrible quality. The metal actually cracked after the first use so it would spray back on you as you tried to use it. Stay away!
5.0,Nice
5.0,"simple, works as it should. very good quality hose. for the price, can't be beat."
5.0,Feels well built and works smoothly
5.0,"Like lots of folks, I bought this sprayer at the recommendation of The Sweethome and I haven't been disappointed. This thing looks like it's what Ward Cleaver would use to water his lawn, but there's a reason it's a classic.

There aren't many options for sprayers at this price point but the Gilmour is a great value. The construction is very solid and will survive misjudged throws that end up on concrete instead of grass (not that I ever have that issue).

If you're used to a sprayer that has a rotating dial with a dozen options, this isn't the one for you. Instead, the only adjustments are made by pressure to the handle (which you can lock in with a knob on the back to spare your hand). This isn't an issue for me, but if you depend on those different options, this might not be the best fit for you.

Overall, it's hard to beat the simple, quality construction at this price and I've just bought a second one so that I have one for each yard."
5.0,Well made and sharp
5.0,"Its blades are sharp enough to prune unnecessary leaves, stems, or flower in my garden."
1.0,"Poor quality.  Made in China nowdays.  Years ago Fiscars brand name use to mean Quality!  No longer true.  Like too many american companies,  its all about saving money to pay the stockholders,  otherwise,  they too will be out of work. This is yet another example of a good quality company ""Fiscars Corp.""  Has cheapened their products in order to compete globally with China.  As soon as China has smothered out the few remaining, american owned stores in the U. S. Then the rest of their plan will be easily placed in position to finish putting the swueeze on remaining Mom and Pop stores.  How sad for us!"
5.0,"nice feel in the hand and easy to use.  You don't have to be a person with a massive hand to use these!
It's a good thing, because mine are the same size they were when I was a teen (I am admittedly a 'few'
years older).
These were delivered quickly and I am very happy.  In fact, I opened the box and took them directly to
my garden to use them.  Only thing that stopped me is the 95+ F temperature right now.
Love these!"
5.0,"as expected, well made"
5.0,"A great tool at at great price.  Also, super fast delivery.  I'm very satisfied."
4.0,It is cheap and gets the job done!
3.0,"Without a ton of use, they already need to be sharpened. Now, to figure that out..."
5.0,Great pair. Cuts threw anything!!!
5.0,Great Product!
5.0,Like it very much. Just be careful not to make turns too sharp. I wound up watering my neighbor's lawn because traveler didn't make the turn. Like the ease of adjustment both in angle of spray and  volume of spray via faucet adjust.
5.0,"This RainTrain works Perfectly! It follows the set out pattern that I created with my Garden Hose. It automatically shuts off when it reaches the included parking ramp. When you do set up the Hose, make sure not to create too sharp of a turn/curve, otherwise it will fall off track and go somewhere and get stuck."
5.0,I have a somewhat narrow back lawn but it is long so i bought this so it water the whole thing and i would not have to always be moving the sprinlers around to get the thing watered. This works great you set it up and then turn on the water right before you go to bed and it will water the area very nicely and now my back lawn looks great.
2.0,"My sprinkler was purchased from Amazo.com

  This is my third Walking Sprinkler. The last two I had were Nelson and I wore them out.

  The new model is different in many ways. IIt has a ""motor"" that drive the sprinkler, both other ones hadstops on each wheel that drove them. They also had metal, not plastic drive and guide wheels. These plastic wheel are the problem. The sprinkler is not heavy enough too stay on track. It will jump the hose, even on a straight run, and go off track.

  Having known this I would not have purchased this item. Another brand would be better, I'm sure.

  GDYURK"
4.0,"This is the third Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler I've owned.  The first two I bought at a local store but for some reason all the major hardware stores are not carrying this in my area right now.  The previous two lasted a good long time but broke when I let them get bogged down which will strip the gears.  I perhaps should have replaced the drive train but just bought a new one instead.  If you don't let it run off into the bushes or up against a wall where it can't go, it works fine.  My own fault for not being more careful.

The best part of this lawn tractor vs. others is the switch to choose fast or slow speed or neutral if you want it to stay in place.  Others don't have this feature and it gives you flexibility.  With my large lawn it was either put in an in ground system, spend a lot of time moving around a stationary sprinkler, or this.  This is a great solution.  My only complaint is the price.  Seems to me it should be a $30-40 item.  At $60 for a simple sprinkler, it is a little above what I think it should sell for and that is why it lost one star.  But with no real competition, I see why it is priced so high."
4.0,"This sprinkler was pretty much what I was looking for.  The spray pattern is easy to adjust, and the gearbox (for forward movement) has a lever for fast, slow, or neutral (in case you just need to water in one spot).

The main problem we've had with this sprinkler, is that the front wheel tends to jump off the hose if there is much curvature in your layout.  I added a couple of washers to the ""steering"" pivot bolt to prevent binding, and I've also found that it helps to keep the pivot area lubed up with silicone spray lubricant.

Otherwise, thumbs up (just don't make any sharp turns)!"
4.0,"The is the perfect watering system for my narrow back yard. With one pass on the Nelson it covers the entire yard.

The only issue I have is it can become stuck and sometimes goes off the hose with a curve.

Overall very satified with the product!"
5.0,"This is a great product. Sure, it weighs 17 pounds, and to the neighbors it probably looks like I'm hauling around a big yellow child's plaything, but it gets the job done!

Yes, I've had to replace the gearbox (just once, so far). Yes, I've come out to find that it had jumped the hose and was trying its best to escape the confines of our yard. Yes, I've come out to find that it had ""thrown a rod"", and was hence spewing water onto a small patch of grass.

I can't say I've been the best owner to it, though. It once sat in a corner of our backyard for over a year, unused. Sitting there under the hot Texas sun. Neglected. Or what about when I set it on ""Neutral"" so I can drag it around the yard on the end of my hose? I'm sure that doesn't do its hose connection any good. Poor guy.

But it works! Set it and forget it. Plug and play. I despised the other sprinkler choices. An oscillating sprinkler? Umm, no thanks -- it covers too wide of an area and doesn't put sufficient water down, given that our Texas wind carries most of the water over to our neighbors yard. The RainTrain lays down water where I tell it to lay down water. What about one of those stationary ""square area"" sprayers? Haha, do you think those little tiny itty bitty droplets of water actually make it to the ground before they evaporate in the hot Texas heat? The RainTrain delivers big heavy purposeful drops of water that land on the grass, not in the air. What about one of those rotary sprinklers? Same problems as the other two. And they all have to be strategically positioned at various points around the yard at various times and I have to remember that they're running or otherwise I'll leave them on overnight and water all the lawns downhill from us. The RainTrain moves where I tell it to move and stops when and where I tell it to stop.

I'm more of a real-time guy. With the RainTrain, I don't do the ""turn it on, see how far the water is thrown, turn it off, adjust it, turn it back on, see how far the water is thrown, turn it off, adjust it, repeat..."" I turn on the water, walk out to it (while its in neutral), gently apply pressure with my hand to the top of the rotor until it stops and then manually adjust it there and then. Once I'm happy, I set the transmission to the forward gear of my choice, release the rotor and let it do its thing. Sure, I get my pant legs wet, that's why I wear shorts.

Do you have one? No? There's probably an ""Add to Cart"" button or something on this page, usually toward the top. Click that, checkout, wait for it to arrive. Your life will change. The grass will be greener (probably because more water is reaching it with the RainTrain than with any of the other so-called ""sprinklers"" that you may have used). Neighbors will be nice and talk to you (""What's that?"" they'll ask, pointing to your RainTrain, because, you know, it IS a conversation piece first and foremost). You'll be more relaxed and at peace with the world (because you'll be mesmerized by the RainTrain as you watch it go quietly about its duties). You'll lose weight and/or build muscle mass (from carrying around its 17-pound heft between watering applications). You'll be richer (time is money, and this saves you a lot of time, which means it saves you a lot of money). It will make you want to be a better person...well, maybe not, let's not get carried away."
5.0,excellent product.  I prefer it over the John Deer Tractor Sprinkler because it is much more convenient to carry.
5.0,"This is the second Nelson Raintrain I've purchased in the last 20 years, and the quality hasn't gone down.  The construction and durability have remained constant."
5.0,"I saw these in the hardware stores at twice the price. I used to spend my summers moving various sprinklers to various parts of my garden. I can lay out a path for this sprinkler and walk away from it. My brother once told me that the only way to have a nice green lawn was to install an underground sprinkler system. He spend $1,400 and I spent $40. A year later, he tore his up to install a pool and my lawn looks as good as his ever did. The only problems I have had are that the sprinkler arms occasionally pop off and the sprinkler will occasionally wander off the hose track so you do want to be home when you use it but it is really an effortless and efficient system. I love it."
5.0,"I found the Nelson 1865 traveling sprinker to be fantastic.  It is a solid, heavy metal sprinkler (it needs to be to have traction to pull itself along).  Setup was not difficult at all.  You need to spend a few minutes making sure your hose track is where you need it to be, but you can walk away for HOURS, so a few minutes versus moving a fixed sprinkler every 30 minutes was not time consuming.  The sprinkler arms adjust very quickly, so getting the spray pattern right should take about 2-3 minutes.  Enjoy!"
1.0,"I have tried every possible formation for the hose,and no matter what I do, the tractor rides right over the hose at every single turn.  Even on straight hoses it rides over the hose if the hose it's pulling isn't in a straight line behind it.  I have even bought different hoses.  I bought a super expensive hose thinking the hardness of it would be difficult for the tractor to ride over, but it still jumps the hose.  I bought a super cheap hose thinking that maybe a lighter hose behind it will make it easier for the tractor to pull and won't pull it off track.  Neither worked.  EVERY time I use this thing I have to watch it or I end up watering the neighbor's lawn.  Today when I tried it with another new hose, thinking I'd finally bought the perfect hose for it, I came to check on how it did with the first turn and found it in the middle of the street watering the street.  A HUGE disappointment!"
4.0,"Does everything advertised.  Travels great in a straight line, not so good turning.  Happy with the product and would buy it again, just need to keep an eye it."
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband. We live in the sticks and pump our water from the creek to keep the grass nice. I was a little concerned the water pressure wouldn't work with this but it's been GREAT! My husband loves his new 'toy' and it's really worked out wonderful. We can run 3 separate hoses off our pump and this STILL runs great. I'm now considering getting a couple more because I think it's silly to spend half your day moving sprinklers in this huge yard. This has saved some time but I'm looking to save even more. This sprinkler is a great, fun way to save time and energy. Set-up is easy and reliable. Thanks!"
4.0,"I have owned two Nelson Raintrain traveling sprinklers. Works as advertised and provides a good soaking for lawn. Original sprinkler, 20 years old, was all metal and seemed to work better than the new sprinkler with plastic wheels. Real advantage to set up and leave sprinkler ""walk"" acrosss lawn. No need to continuously change sprinkler position. Slow speed is really slow, but delivers a lot of water to lawn."
5.0,This Neslon Traveling Sprinkler is as heavy duty of a unit that one can imagine. It works great and waters the most even of all the sprinklers I have ever used. Wish I would have pruchased one a long time ago. The seller filled my order extremly fast and UPS delivered it in just a few days. A customer could not ask for any better service. Thank you all
5.0,We already had one Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler and decided to get another so we could get the entire yard done in half the time.  They are fun to watch travel and it sure beats having to go out every hour or so and move the sprinkler.  They definitely do a great job.  We set ours to a slow speed so that we can get a thorough watering.
5.0,"I bought this because I purchased several bushes and trees this year and they need to be watered regularly until established.  This gets the whole yard with all the new plants in about an hour while I get breakfast and get ready for work.  If I do leave before it is done, the auto shut off will stop it before it gets to the driveway.

Have not had any problems with it and I would tell anyone that is considering it to get it."
4.0,"The sprinkler comes partially assembled and finishing it is easy and does not require tools.  Easy to set up and use.  A few words of caution for its use:1) Be careful having it travel close to delicate plants.  The force of the water two feet from the arms actually shredded some of my canna leaves.  2) The sprinkler will bog down in mud because of its weight.  Avoid having it travel under low tree branchs that drip down and make puddles in the sprinklers path.

The Raintrain sprinkler is ideal for large open lawns."
5.0,"NIce, sharp!  I had moved in to a house with a lot of overgrowth, and this is working like a charm."
5.0,"So far, so good.  I just need to keep it away from the kids.  They tend to destroy my cutters by leaving them out or using them inappropriately.  Happy gardening :)"
4.0,This are some nice pruning scissors.
1.0,Bent cutting a hydrangea branch the diameter  of a pencil .... First time out of box
1.0,"used these to prune small branches from shrubs around house, had not completed task when jaws loosened up to the point where cutting jaw would roll over the intended stalk of branch making me reposition the shears again, VERY FRUSTRATING, SAVE YOUR MONEY, BUY A BETTER PAIR. THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!"
5.0,They get the job DONE!
5.0,"these were bought for me.  got two pair, have them both, still sharp as the day I got them. and you haven't seen ME PRUNE!!!!"
5.0,"I bought these after buying the Fiskars Micro-Tip Pruning Snips for heavier duty pruning than the Micro-Tips could handle. As always, the Fiskars brand does not disappoint. A sturdy build with nice sharp blades, comfortable grips, and a nice clean cut. The little orange circle in the center allows you to store the shears safely with the blades locked shut. Definitely handy to have even for the amateur gardener."
5.0,AMAZING shears! They have such a great grip that you can cut things effortlessly. I've used these on very thick branches and it's as if the scissors didn't skip a beat to cut. I recommend that you wash them after every use. This has proven to help maintain them in excellent condition. If you do wash them make sure you give it enough time to dry before storing so that they don't rust.
5.0,"The best shears, my second pair in several years. The other pair did not wear out, I just lost them.  They stay sharp and do a great job. Very comfortable to use."
5.0,"Works great, inexpensive"
5.0,"Very nice nozzle with the most important thing being that it doesn't leak.  If I want to, I can leave the hose on and for days and it still won't leak at all.  I purchased one of these for the hose in my backyard and have since purchased another one for the hose in my front yard because I liked it so much.  The nozzle adjustment is pretty standard and with the right adjustment you can get a pretty tight stream which is generally what I want/use/"
5.0,Haven't seen one of these in years. Heavy duty and looking forward to using it.
5.0,Winner! Very powerful and easy to handle!  Awesome purchase!
5.0,"A great and simple nozzle that is constructed of metal.  I use this nozzle outside on my garden hose and it performs admirably.  Was getting tired of the plastic ones (similar to this design) busting and spraying water from every crevice or the more complex plastic ones with the rotating heads getting gummed up by particles of dirt and ceasing to work.  Be aware that if you are using this on a water source that is heated (like the one I used to use at work to clean floors) you may not like this nozzle, as it will quickly heat up and transfer all that heat into your hand unless you wear gloves.  That being said, I believe this nozzle will offer prolonged service for most conditions."
5.0,Great
1.0,It broke after 5 uses. Waste of money
1.0,I ordered this along with a hose.  I received the hose but not the nozzle - and no paperwork in box either!
1.0,Broke within 3 weeks of use nozzle got stuck and it continues to do so.
3.0,"I have been using Gilmour Supreme hoses and nozzles for 30 years.  Quality took a dip when they moved manufacturing offshore, and took another dip when Fiskars acquired Gilmour.  Their kink-free hoses now kink easily and often..The new nozzle that I recently got from Amazon is so stiff that if requires two-hand operation, because the plunger is sticky and the nozzle won't close when you release your grip, even after a little lubrication.  Very inconvenient, messy, and wastes water.  Still better than the junk at Home Depot, but a huge disappointment from a company that used to sell the best nozzle available.  I will try one more to see if the current one is a fluke."
5.0,"This is the second Raintrain I've owned.  The first one was accidently dropped and the hose connection was bent beyond repair, but after 8 years it had proven its worth.  I don't have a huge yard but it's not small either. If you have a small yard this is not the product for you.  Conventional sprinklers won't cover my yard without having to go out and move them at least twice which as you know is a pain.  The travling sprinkler lets me lay out my hose, turn on the water and walk away.  It shuts off automatically and is fully adjustable so you don't waste a great deal of water.  Eventually I'll invest in a sprinkler system, but until then this is definitely the way to go."
5.0,This is the best waterer I have ever owned..and it is SO cute! I loved mine so much that I ordered another and sent it to my dad. He loves his as much as I love mine. It really gives the lawn a good soaking. My yard is really big and I can set it up and have my whole yard and borders watered in a few hours. Sometimes I catch myself sitting and watching it cruise across the yard....very relaxing.
4.0,"My aunt had a similar sprinkler back in the 1960s and she watered about an acre and a half with it. She had one of the most beautiful lawns in my little home town. My lawn is tiny compared to hers but this sprinkler looked like it would work well since I have long ""strips"" to water. It works very well for that. I'm still working on getting it to turn gentle curves without jumping off the hose. It's very well built and I can see that I'll get quite a few seasons of use out of it."
5.0,"This is the second sprinkler we've had and they work great.  You don't have to keep moving it around the lawn, you can set it and forget it."
5.0,"I received the Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler in good time and in perfect working order. Although only used once so far, I put it through all its paces. I love this thing. I will recommend it to anyone who asks about it.
Thanks, Amazon, for another job well done."
5.0,"Not cheap ($50) but works as advertised and really made well, must weigh 20lbs.  The automatic turn-off is a real turn-on.  There are even more expensive ones but why?"
5.0,"We have a large lawn with no sprinklers and a well fed water system. After a quote for $8000 for in-ground sprinklers with the associated hassles, I stumbled upon this jewel of a way to water the lawn without installing a sprinkler system that would require maintenance and preparation each fall for the freeze of the New England.

Dragging 100 feet of heavy rubber hose behind it, this little beauty had NO ISSUE across slightly upward sloping terrain. Throwing the water across a wide span of lawn. Upon reaching the stop, the sprinkler turned itself off without issue.

I recommend this product highly."
5.0,"This sprinkler is the best way to get an even amount of water on your lawn. The Shut-off switch on the bottom is very nice and works great, much better than the previous models that attached to the end of the hose. This one works anywhere on the hose. The only things to watch are areas with no grass. The tractor will make mud and dig it's tires in until it is stuck, so it needs to me monitored a bit. Also, make sure the tractor shut-off ramp is on a straight line of hose. Otherwise the tractor will not ride over it. This is a very well built product that will last many years."
5.0,"Hot, dry, summers, very high winds occasionally. ( High fire danger in summer, fall). My green patch of an acre stays that way due to this wonderful watering device.
Tha water distribution is adjustable. When the wind is blowing, drying everything out, the sprinkler tubes can be adjusted to keep lower to the ground surface."
2.0,"I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move."
4.0,Love these!
4.0,nice shears
5.0,Great product and you can sharpen these when they become dull.
5.0,"I use these more than I thought I would, has cut through some really thick branches."
5.0,Excellent - just what I wanted.
2.0,These are weak and started coming apart within just a few uses on small rose stems.
5.0,Sharp... These worked very well pruning my Rhubarb and Roses
2.0,I bought this based on great reviews of the product.  It did its job when cutting but it closes every time and won't pop open per each cut.  Have to open it with both hands every time.  Very annoying.  Hope I can fix it or have to get another pair that works better.
5.0,balanced and easy to use
5.0,ok
5.0,Nice little nozzle. I like that it is metal. Haven't managed to break it yet.
5.0,Old school great
5.0,Just as promised. I have gone through many of these over the years that had plastic components that just didn't hold up.  I'm sure this one will last due to solid metal design.
4.0,Leaks when fitted to a hose. But I use it for watering plants just like a drip system. Good spray gun!
5.0,Bought 4 of these and put them on all my hoses. Work great!
5.0,Long lasting solid metal nozzle. Not like the cheap plastic ones that break easily.
5.0,I originally looked at the thoducts that have 18 settings and cost $25.  Then I asked myself why I would buy one of those.  I could buy three Gilmour's for that price.  The Gilmour has infinite settings and is absolutely a fantastic product for the price.
5.0,works good!
3.0,"Just as I expected. Nothing more, nothing less."
5.0,Solid built and will outlast the plastic nozzles you find. I have been using these for 20 yrs. i had to order new ones after someone drove over my nozzle with a car
2.0,"I have owned the Nelson Raintrain for two seasons. With just a little experimentation I was able to get the tractor to navigate nearly all the turns in my lawn. I learned that I could attach an unlimited amount of hose to reach the ends of our property as long as I periodically pulled hose to prevent the trailing length from becoming too heavy. No constant moving a sprinkler from one spot to another and it had the good sense to shut off automatically when it was finished. It's now in the landfill.

It partially broke just when I had it mastered and was fully enjoying the benefits of a traveling sprinkler. The first thing to go was the auto shutoff. The tractor would run up the ramp and not shut off but would normally stall or topple over. This created a pond and if the wheels were still turning, torn sod.

Eventually the gear stripped and it would no longer turn the wheels. I'm sure this was hastened by the times it didn't shut off and stalled out while digging in the sod.

The principal is great as are the promised benefits. Fortunately, there are better made alternatives. For about a hundred dollars more you can get a National Walking Sprinkler model that has steel gears and has been around since the thirties - made in Nebraska I believe. Amazon sells their model B3 or they have a web site. You won't regret the additional investment. As it does not have auto shutoff, you may want to add a timer."
5.0,I liked this so much I ordered two more. Great for not having to use clock and move sprinklers. Easy to adjust spray. Only disadvantage is to adjust spray by yourself on big yard making trips back and forth to faucet.
5.0,"This tractor is fun for my 4-year-old and saves me a lot of time. You must own a rigid, good hose, though. It does exactly what it is billed as doing--follows the hose in either high or low. Only minor complaint is that it already shows some rust on the body."
5.0,"My Nelson Traveling Sprinkler is a complete SATISFACTION. It's also fun to watch the ""little dude"" march across the back yard."
5.0,"I have been using this machine for the past month and found it to be properly designed.  It works as represented and pulls long lengths of hose without running off the track.  Best feature:  water spray radius varies from 55' down to 15' useful for my odd shaped lawn, also its two speeds are good for various watering depths."
5.0,This sprinkler is efficient both with water conservation in mind and time spent watering. This sprinkler has little evaporation due to the way it waters. Water sprays in a stream from the ends of the watering wands and not from multiple holes which create a lot of fine spray which can evaporate before the water hits the ground. Turn this sprinkler on at night to maximize water efficiency and sleep while your lawn is watered. Very little set up time and monitoring is required.
4.0,Very nice to have.  It migrates to the desired spots in the lawn and shuts off at the designated location.  Well thought out and a good design.  The Nelson coupling helps prevent wear and tear on the knuckles.
5.0,"Good product I would recommend it to a friend. We have a large yard without a built in sprinkler system, this is a great alternative that will cover a lot of area. We put out over 150' of hose and it has no problems. It is still not completely set and forget, every once in a while it will jump the hose if you have to tight of a turn, you have to learn what it can and can't handle. I would not buy this product if you have low water pressure. When we first started using it it would take all day to travel 150' and put a lot of water on the yard. We figured out that our water pressure was to low for it to travel at the correct speed, so we had to adjust the water pressure regulator at the water inlet for our house, ever sense then it has been working great."
1.0,"A traveling sprinkler made in the USA (National Walking Sprinkler, Omaha, NE) costs more, but is 10-times better.
We've owned two of these Nelson  devices.  They work pretty well when new, but the plastic gears  soon deteriorate and then these 18-pound beauties are absolutely useless. Don't know if they can go in the recycle bin.
There are a lot of reviews complaining about the gear problem. Take them seriously.
The manufacturer could easily remedy this problem, but they have not.
It's an expensive contraption, but, as another reviewer said, its best use may be as a boat anchor.
Caveat emptor."
5.0,"My husband is very happy with the Nelson Sprinkler.  We could not purchase it anywhere else & so happy for Amazon where we can purchase items when all else
fails."
5.0,Perfect
5.0,"Great feel and very easy to use and when through using them, easy to secure."
5.0,"Very pleased with our new clippers. They are sharp, cut 1/2 -1 inch branches very effectively with a comfortable grip. The lock is secure. Great price for a good tool"
5.0,Great for yard work.  It easily cuts all my branches.  I always try my shears first before moving to anything larger (works most of the time).  It is also very durable having cut tons of branches!
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Great  easy to use
5.0,"Nice soft grip, strong blade and safety latch. I've used it to trim smaller shrubs and blackberry bushes."
5.0,"They work well. I have minimal use for them, so they don't get rugged use. but they seem to be of modestly good quality."
5.0,My second pair.  Love them.
5.0,Good price and works perfectly.
4.0,"Pistol grip hose nozzle is excellent. Works as advertised. Not sure of the materials of construction, so I don't know if it is ""drinking water safe"". Hope I am not spraying Chinese industrial waste on my vegetables!"
5.0,"It's cheap, and it doesn't leak on my foot. That's good enough for me."
5.0,price is right
5.0,"I ordered two of these by mistake, but glad I did, they are perfect. High quality, nicely built, and durable construction. No leaks and have a weight to them that makes them feel nice. I highly recommend."
5.0,Old school. Pressure base on how hard you squeeze your hand. I use it for the patio and the neighbor dog. Love it.
5.0,Loved this so much I ordered it again.
5.0,"It's old school and it just works. No leaks, supplied washer is good and it feels solid. Best of all it isn't plastic and won't break very easily."
5.0,"Back when I was a golf cart relocation engineer, this was my favorite nozzle to use.  Why? Because this baby is built to take a beating.  After washing a cart you try to place the hose down but the nozzle usually ends up smacking on the pavement.  Any plastic nozzle will crack and leak after a few bumps against assault, but not this beauty.  This nozzle does not have the option for 11 different streams.  But who needs that! You simply hold the grip tight for jet to wash the car or hold lightly to spray gently on the flowers.  Dont make this more difficult than it needs to be people! Stop reading this and click add to cart.  It will change your life, it sure changed mine."
5.0,Works great.  Nothing like the classics.  Don't waste moneyon fancy plastic cap that will break avert 1 year of you are lucky
4.0,"I bought this for 3 reasons:  First, Gilmour products haven't let me down.  Second, the threaded nozzle can come in very handy as a valve in my drip irrigation system for the garden. Third, I'm too hard on the plastic nozzles so I buy this metal style for longer life."
4.0,We enjoy not having to move the sprinkler ever 20-30 minutes.  You do have to be cautious when you have curves or slopes in your yard.  Very heavy.
5.0,"I love this sprinkler.  It is my second one, not because it quit working (14 year old) but because we have a new house with front and back sod so I needed two going at once to soak the whole yard in one day.  It has a fast mode, a still mode, and a slow mode (I think it suppose to drop 1"" of water on the slow mode).  I love it for sod.  And you can't beat 14 years working strong.  I will say the turn off mechanism does not always work so I never leave the house to go for more then an hour.  Occasionally it can get stuck if the hose is twisted or the ground real uneven but I just check it once an hour and it's great."
5.0,"This is my 3rd ""tractor"" sprinkler.  While nothing lasts forever, I chose this sprinkler to replace one that had stripped the plastic gears after several years of use.  The ease of laying this sprinkler and hose out to cover large or lengthy lawns beats the alternative of constantly moving pulsating or other type sprinklers.  When the sprinkler gets to the cut off ramp, it does exactly that.  I've forgotten that I was watering the lawn and the result was wasted water and a very soggy lawn in that one spot.  That doesn't happen with these sprinklers.  The price was right as it was lower than what I could purchase it on the local level, plus I saved even more without the state/local sales tax tacked on."
2.0,"I bought this sprinkler to deal with a newly seeded lawn that I needed to water daily.  I liked the idea that this sprinkler can move through a relatively large area unattended.  I dislike this sprinkler because it ""jumps"" the hose regularly (even though it is laid straight, nothing in the way), it's gears on high-gear stripped after half a season and finally it's just slow to cover the area it is trying to cover - my old sprinkler (back and forth fan style) put just as much water down in less time so even though I would have had to move it a few times - at least I could water the lawn in an evening.  I haven't dumped it (yet)- but it's not worth the money..."
5.0,"I bought this about two months ago after reading several reviews on different types of traveling sprinklers.  This has lived up to my expectations.  The body is very sturdy, made from cast iron.  It is very well constructed.  I like having two speeds since I had just overseeded I could slow it down for increased watering.  I've only had it jump off the hose once, but I think it was my fault for the way the hose was layed out. The wheels are made of plastic but seem well constructed and they have some pretty decent spikes for traction.  I imagine I will have this for years to come.  Buy it, you'll be glad you did."
5.0,"a great and reasonably priced traveling sprinkler.  My last one of the exact model lasted 8 years, thats why i bought another one."
5.0,"Excellent quality, heavy and well constructed.  Very easy to set up and operate.  I previously had to keep moving the sprinkler and had many areas that would overlap to get the coverage. This sprinkler has both the range and the coverage. No problems with turns.  Easily adjusted for water throw. I'm just sorry I didn't get it earlier in the season.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"Sprinkler worked well for watering large areas.  Does not work so well when the lawn is brand new and the grass has not yet germinated.  Overall, it was worth the money."
3.0,I own two of these sprinklers. The gear boxes - the parts that get the most wear and tear - are made of plastic and nylon. Both gear boxes in my sprinkler have broken. One gear box was less than a year old. I have contacted the company and never have received a response.
5.0,"I had the original model from way back. The new one has made this a winner. It's easier to set up, the auto turn off is simpler. I recommend installing a cut-off valve on the hose just out of the spray to eliminate going back to the source to turn off and on when positioning the sprayer."
2.0,The nozzle did not function as I expected.  I found it hard to change and maintain a flow pattern.
5.0,"Works great, very good quality."
5.0,Great value for the price.  It sprays with great water pressure.
5.0,Good quality
5.0,"Strong, simple but effective"
5.0,I use this to hose down my garage and it's perfect
5.0,"Takes a beating and keeps on working, what else can you ask for?!"
5.0,"No frills, doesn't break. Just works... and for cheap."
5.0,Very good quality and affordable
5.0,Still working fine after sitting outside over the winter.
1.0,Theory is great....practicality and reality are not!  I built a new house so my yard has been tilled and I planted new seed.  The problem that I experienced is the raintrain gets STUCK.  What happens is the raintrain waters in a circular pattern but when it travels to where it has already watered it gets stuck.  It looks like they would have designed it to only water behind the raintrain.  It may work better on an already established lawn but I do not recommend this product if you are wanting to water a new lawn.
4.0,"Overall, this was a purchase I've been pleased with.  Wish I had known that they would fade very fast, but that doesn't effect the usage of them."
5.0,"I've owned one for many years which simply wore out and the plastic began to biograde so wanted a replacement which I bought recently. Except for the automatic shut-off it was the same type and I hope will last as long as the previous. If it fits your needs, go for it."
5.0,This sprinkler works as stated . It will track on the hose so you don't have to go out and keep moving the location or will work in fixed location by switching a lever .
5.0,"We had one when I was a kid.  This worked well.  It does exactly what it says it will.  It pulled a 100ft commercial hose after itself with ease.  has 2 speeds as well as neutral.  set it up in about 4 minutes.  not too heavy for my 90yr old Granmother to move around but heavy enough to stay on the hose.  Only complaint was if the hose was at a 90 deg angle then when it was on ""fast"" speed it would occasionally derail.  When it was on ""slow"", it was fine and would take any pattern we set out for it to follow."
5.0,"Overall:  Well built, heavy castings, wheels well grounded even in uneven ground, with right water pressure can throw a surprising distance.  The two speeds are a good idea for those days when the slow increased water is not needed.  On Flat ground and with a decent lawn that does not catch the hose in bare spots seem to drag about 150 feet of hose easily.
Issues: a) Connection with hose a little ackward given the weight and required location to drag the hose properly a quick disconnect combination is worth avoiding the trouble.  b) Uneven ground can be an issue as you drag a significant length of hose...an incline up for a turing point may cause it to ride over the tracking hose. c) Common to the design the circular pattern of water dispersion requires it to be moving for full coverage of an area, the stationary is therefore impractical. d)Pay attention to the sprinkler head angles for coverage.
Would I buy this product again... yes"
4.0,This sprinkler works great. A bit heavy but it should last. It looks to be repairable. I don't expect to have to do that any time soon.
4.0,"I have been wanting one of these for years.  I finally purchased one 2 summers ago after pouring over reviews for months.  My expectation was that the Nelson 1865 might last a season or two, during which I would gain personal experience sufficient to invest in something more durable.

I am now pleasantly surprised.  The major sign of wear is some fading to the yellow paint due to sun exposure.  I don't put it away often enough.  Otherwise, no mechanical failures.

It has been great fun to just watch or play with on a hot day when needing to cool down.  It is frankly mesmerizing and relaxing after a complicated day at work.  The large wheels have no difficulty on low or high speed moving smoothly through grass that is at least 3-4 inches in length. I typically choose the slow speed for a deeper soaking and water once or twice a week.  Most of the time it navigates well over a coupling used to repair the hose.  On rare occasions if the hose-coupling protrudes too much it trips the shut-off value.  The sprinkler has only failed to stop once with the included brake.

However, I will admit it has had some spectacular crashes when the operator forgot to set the brake ramp (a separate plastic component that is included).  In one of these crashes it attempted to crawl up the side of the plastic rain-gutter extension piece in my back yard.  The crash resulted in a roll over with one sprinkler arm projected straight up and the resultant spray travelling over 25-30 feet upward in the air and arcing more than 30 feet forward over my steeply sloped side lawn.  An amazed young boy attending a party next door spotted a beautiful descending stream of water pouring along the side my house from far overhead, complete with a full spectrum rainbow.  Of course, he couldn't see the tractor ""wreck"" in my backyard.  With an utterly incredulous look on his face, he came over to ask whether my house had exploded and was leaking or whether it really was raining from just one hole in the sky!!!

Occasionally the sprinkler arms need to be tightened.  Even without such crashes, they typically require repositioning on nearly every use.  The reason is that its spring-loaded shut-off valve is located below the main body.  It stays closed once it has been triggered by the brake until all water pressure is out of the feeder line, or the hose has been disconnected.  Thus the act of reopening the spring valve generally requires that I turn the sprinkler on its side. The valve can be cranky. So the process is a mild annoyance.  This situation might be improved by putting in an extention to the hose attachment leaving my hand a little more room to manuever next to the body of the tractor.  I guess I have not been bothered enough to worry about it.

Overall.  I feel like I indulged a childhood pleasure to purchase it.  No regrets.  There are clearly numerous creative opportunities for special effects and light shows.  Thus far, after nearly 2 seasons I don't see any need for a replacement."
5.0,This is an excellent product and works trouble free.  Repair parts are readily available should they be needed.
1.0,"1 is way too many stars for this product.  The main unit is cast metal and weighs perhaps 20#.  The gears are light weight plastic and have a life expectancy of about 50 hours.  That comes to $1 per hour cost of operation.  Of course, there is no warranty.  I understand they used to have metal gears and would last a lifetime.  But alas, now they are made in China (in spite of what the catalog sheet says) and are junk.  I wouldn't bother to try to use it, if someone gave me one - much less buy it!"
5.0,"Works well, as described..."
5.0,These are better than the ones I've been using for the past ten years.  I like the comfort grip.  I think the lock will work better than my old ones that would lock when I didn't want them to.
5.0,"Great shears! Easy to lock and open. Very sharp and cuts easily.
Excellent company that stands to support their products with a superb warranty."
3.0,"These Bypass Pruning Shears arrived safely and without incidence.
First off, the shears that I received had iGarden, NOT Fiskars stamped on the handle. So are you buying a genuine Fiskars product? I have no idea, but it surely doesn't appear so.
The shears do feel weighty but are average quality. There were some slipped cut marks on the steel and slight burrs on the blades.
The handles are covered with plastic sheathing and then coated again with more plastic coating. The plastic seems crudely glued on on one handle but not on the opposite one. It seems they attempted finger grooves but stopped at two, and they are not proportionately sized nor placed correctly. Given that they are hard plastic handles, they do not provide a super comfortable grip but adequate and non-slip.
The blades are sharp upon arrival and I believe these shears to be good for light-duty snipping and pruning but I wouldn't attempt to cut branches or using these for prolonged periods of time.
The locking mechanism is something I like, I prefer the slide lock versus the traditional latch style. It is made of plastic, so I am not sure how long it will hold up to repeated opening and closing.

PROS:
Blades constructed of non-stick high carbon steel.
Blades are sharp out of package.
Nice and weighty at 0.7 pounds.
Easy slide-lock mechanism.
Reasonably priced.
CONS:
Plastic handles are not super comfortable.
Manufactured in China.
Recommend to a friend? Likely.
Would I purchase again?  More evaluation needed after repetitive use, but likely.

Overall Impression: Satisfied with this purchase. At this price point, this is a definitely a decent set of shears.

2.0,"The product link took me to a Fiskars product, but the order history shows ""iGarden Traditional Bypass Pruning Shears Garden Scissor Heavy Duty.""  I was so confused when this product arrived, and had to check back with my order history.  This is deceptive!

That said, I needed the shears so I had to use them (rather than run out to a brick and mortar store to buy more).  They were OK.  I was trimming some bushes with quarter-inch, or thinner, branches.  These shears were very sharp in the beginning, but after 30 minutes of cutting I felt they were less sharp.  I handed them off to my husband, just to be sure it was not my hand fatigue, and he said they were dull to him.

They seemed like they had potential.  The grips are thick and coated with a comfortable foam rubber product.  The hinge action is smooth, and easy to open and close for cutting.

I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate, in exchange for my unbiased review.  Based on my experience, with the specific product that I have received, I am not confident in recommending this product in its current state."
1.0,"I took it out of the package, used it to cut a couple branches...and it no longer works....after one use!!!...I know it has a warranty...but am I really going to go to the trouble of returning it to whomever...."
4.0,"My brand did not come with the traditional ""Fiskars"" on it, so I'm unsure what is going on here. The ones I got look like an off brand from IGarden, that look like the one pictured just a cheaper version. I do have no complaints regarding the pair of pruning shears I got, they are sharp & cut rather well when I am making my own flower arrangement. What I love about these shears mostly is the child lock, it is sort of hard to slide to release blade, but that makes me happy knowing my little ones couldn't get them opened. Overall, I am happy with the shears & do recommend them for simple cutting jobs. I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review."
5.0,Got these to replace a old one Best shears for light pruning
4.0,"""These are great"""
5.0,Works as expected!
3.0,"This is a great sprinkler if you're just needing to put a small amount of water down. The most it can put down in one pass is 1/2"" of water. It is typically better to water deeply vs. just get the top part of the soil wet, which this seems to do. My grass is very thick, so it takes more water to get down to the roots, but when it gets down there, it stays for awhile, because the soil is clay, and the grass is thick. It takes a certain amount of water to get the grass blades saturated enough to let the water begin soaking into the ground. When I only have a 1/2"" of water to work with each time, it doesn't seem to get much into the soil, promoting a shallow root system.

Other then that, this sprinkler is very easy to use. It's not very precise, but that didn't bother me much at all because I have a large lawn. Nelson's customer service is outstanding! They replaced the entire gear mechanism on it with only spending a few minutes on the phone."
1.0,I have 3 of these and have replaced the gearbox in all 3 and now all 3 are stripped out again. Won't buy another 1.
4.0,"I have used many different traveling sprinklers since I was a child and this is the best I have ever used. I currently own two, the John Deere which I have owned for 5 months and a Nelson 1865 Raintrain which I have owned for around 7 years. Even after its time in service, the Nelson is performing much better than the JD.

I am a former military member and have had to take care of many different lawns and this sprinkler has worked well on all of them. The ability to adjust the speed of the movement and the circumference of the spray has been a lawn saver on many occasions. One of the best things about the Nelson 1865 is its ability to pull long hoses. I currently use a 150 ft hose and it has never slowed the sprinkler or pulled it off track. At the current price, you will never find a better bargain for a poor man's auto sprinkler system. I love this thing so much I have decided to order anther one to replace the John Deere."
5.0,"Don't hesitate in buying your Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler. I bought two, and love them. For a smooth yard they are sensational."
5.0,"I have had my latest Nelson Rain Train for over 15 years. It has always worked flawlessly. This product is not well-suited for large rectangular areas, but great for long narrow strips. I use it on one side of my house where it would be awkward to use an impact sprinkler. It can turn, but not too much - especially when it is dragging a long length of hose. If you use it for a straight-line pattern, it can haul about 75' of hose behind it. I finally ruined it when I forgot and left it on all night; it got caught in a hairpin bend of the hose - usually it just jumps the hose and keeps going, but this time it got stuck and it stripped the gears. Otherwise very durable and reliable, with no maintenance required. I am definitely going to get another one. You can get replacement parts for it too - the gearbox is about $23, but for $50 from Amazon with free shipping, I will just get a new one."
5.0,"It works, and these days that's one of the best things you can say about a product. We owned a Raintrain a good many years ago before it finally gave out. Unable to find one anywhere, we bought an imitation. It lasted all of three weeks before I saw the Raintrain advertised on Amazon.com. Ordering from Amazon.com is a snap. Our new Raintrain has worked like a charm. I don't expect to need another one for a long, long time."
4.0,"I have been using 2 of these sprinklers on 1 1/2+ acre yard for 10 years.  At first I was disenchanted with the number of times that I left them for several hours only to come back and find out that they had bogged down somewhere or jumped track or otherwise misbehaved. This wasted my watering hours and my water!

I tried numerous other sprinklers for half of a season, thinking those were just a waste, but then I realized how much work it was to use other ones on this size yard. So, I dragged them back out and started learning how to use them effectively.

I don't leave them unattended (when I'm not home). I go check on them every hour or so, which is what I would be doing with the other kinds of sprinklers, anyway. I use heavy duty, 120 ft. hoses, which get to be pretty heavy for the sprinkler if they get too long  behind them. I also  have very sandy soil, which means they get less traction anyway.  So, I just pull the hose through and reset the hose position, and we're good to go again for an hour or 2.

There is a learning curve in learning what to look for along the path of the hose - sticks, rocks, etc. It takes a couple of times of having it jump track or whatever to learn how to keep it working smoothly.

I figured out that once I learned how to use  these sprinklers, they are a lot less work and time than any others at your local hardware store. Watering a yard is a lot of work, no matter what, it's just a matter of how you want to spend your time. I rarely have to pick up a sprinkler and move it, so the heft is not too bad. I also understand they have to be heavy in order to work. I would rather spend a little time repositioning the hose every hour or 2 than turning off the water, moving the whole sprinkler and setting it up again, having to check and see where the water is going, and making sure it waters where you need it.

The parts for this sprinkler are easy to find (customer service is awesome), and they're easy to replace. Other sprinklers have to be thrown away after a season or 2.

I would recommend this sprinkler as long as you are willing to have a little learning curve."
5.0,"We have tried using soaker hoses to keep flowerbeds damp, but two acres require several reels of hoses, reducing the water pressure.  The Nelson raintrain allows you to see the volume being sprayed and the progress it has made.  Monitor its progress, initially, to make sure that the contours of your yard are level and the curves of the hoses are gradual, then enjoy the satisfaction of watching your plants and lawn turn green again!"
4.0,"I have used this type of water sprinkler for years.  I live in an arid area where we have to water if we want to sustain foliage, so this type of traveling sprinkler is excellent for the convenience it provides.  In my experience with this sprinkler, it wears out after a few years.  Also they are delicate, you may have to reattach the wands from time to time.  However, that seems to be the norm for this type of item no matter which one you decide on as I have owned several different brands.  I would buy another should the need arise."
5.0,"I have used two Raintrains to water my lawn (one for front yard & one for back) for the last 15-20 years.  My lawn is not smooth and flat either.  They will tip over on a very steep sideslope.  One of them finally quit a few weeks ago (I think a tooth broke on one of the gears.) I immediately ordered a new one and so far it works great, just like the old one."
5.0,"Great deal, fast shipping and very nice product as expected."
4.0,solid construction.good range of spray.low cost .
5.0,"Great price, easy to use."
4.0,"So far good.  I have only had it a bit, and only used it a few times since I got it during the middle of winter.  I came from a twist nozzle style before this, which I had to replace because the twist mechanism got bound up and would no longer work.  Based on the Wirecutter/Sweethome review I bought this pistol grip nozzle.  Very happy that I did.  The pistol grip is much easier to use and more ergonomic than the twist style for my uses; watering a few plants out front and washing the cars.  The variable spray pattern is good, fairly high pressure at full bore, but a nice variation of sprays that does don't beat down our plants. It can be a little on/off on the jet vs. spray pattern, but it's not a major complaint.

Since I just got it I can speak to the gasket longevity, but they don't appear to be that expense to replace.  I'm not gentle on my hose/nozzle, its sits next to the house all year and gets tossed around when washing the cars.  We'll see how it holds up, but first impressions make me think it will do just fine."
4.0,Works fine. So far so good.
5.0,...after going through about 8 cheap plastic nozzles.
2.0,It leaks
5.0,Simple. Tired of Sears junk with lifetime warranty which just means endless trips to replace. This could be the last one you ever buy!
4.0,This unit has lasted longer than others I bought because it's made of metal and not cheap plastic.
5.0,"Cheap and durable. Plastic sucks, cast zinc is better"
1.0,Broken (will not close to snip) within 2 months of use. Not the Fiskars quality of old.
5.0,"Always my favorite pruning shear, for Years!  Holds up and stays sharp, season after season."
4.0,works good for small bushes and a quick clean up. blades are sharp and stay sharp. comfortable grip. doesn't work well with bigger branches.
5.0,GREAT FISKERS PRODUCT AND WORKS WELL.
5.0,Awesome product. Seems sturdy and of high quality. I would definitely recommend these if you are thinking about buying!!!!
4.0,"Great for dead heading roses and flowers.  This set of pruning shears seem to be straining at 1/2 inch branches of the rhododendrons and knockout rose bushes.  I like that the bypass blades can be removed for cleaning, when needed.  Works great for smaller, snipping duties.  Must say that the steel handles have scrapes that look as if done in manufacturing.  These were also packaged on a blister pack, like you'd see at the Dollar Store.  I didn't feel as if I was getting a high quality set of pruning shears, but they work just fine!

Purchased at a discount in exchange for giving feedback in reviews.  These are a solid 4/5.  They work well, but are an economy pruning shear set and not as strong as others I own."
5.0,Makes pruning an easier job.  Best shears that I have owned!
1.0,Did not receive Fiskars brand pruning shears. Cheap knock offs.
5.0,It's sturdy and well designed! Like it so far.
1.0,The tool I received is not fiskars. The brand says garden. I thought I was purchasing a fiskars pruning sheers.
5.0,"I have only had this for about a month now. But I have used it alot in that time.

It has worked pretty much flawlessly.

I have 200 feet of hose and I have the tractor run about 150 feet of it. It has not had any problem pulling it along.

I have tested the limits of how tight a corner it will take. As other reviewers have mentioned it really will not take much of a corner. But now that I know the limits it is not a problem at all.

I remember reading about some models (Not sure if this was one) where reviewers said the gears got stripped.  Well mine had the perfect chance to do that. One time when I made the corner too sharp it jumped track and went into a perennial bed - hit the edge of the bed but the wheels never stopped - they actually kept turning and dug a hole sinking down until the wand finally hit ground and stopped the thing.  When I saw that I felt if the gears weren't stripped by that they would probably never get stripped.  It ran perfectly even after that.

It has two speeds and they are significantly different enough that it could prove to be useful.

The wands are not particualrly heavy duty and if you did something stupid liked stepping on them I could see them snapping. So no I would not recommend using it for kids to jump thru like a water toy.

Overall the only regret is that I didn't buy it 4-5 years ago when I first moved here.

I will update this review periodically

7-13-12 Update:
Ok so I left it out over the winter and the plastic T (for the wands) froze, cracked and leaked.  Loctite fixed that and it has been fine all season.

A few times (well many) I forget to set the shutoff and it eventually tracks off the hose. But what amazes me it that it will not stop until something stops the wand. Even if it runs into something the wheels keep cranking and it will even dig a hole until something gets in the way of the wands. I need to take a picture of that. In view of that it's hard to imagine the gears ever getting stripped.

I am on a well at at times have very low water pressure - ocassionally it is not enough to move the wands. (But often it is not enough to move even an oscillating sprinkler)

Overall I still rate this a five star."
4.0,"Recieved very quickly just what was described.  One small piece was broken when we opened the box, Nelson quickly sent a replacement at no charge.  Does just what the description says, my yard looks much better."
3.0,"It does its job.  I have to split my 75' X 100' yard into two parts.  I need to keep an eye on it to make sure that it doesn't jump off track.

What I like about it is because it travels and does not shoot the water high into the air it is the best way to water my lawn evenly, which is something that other sprinklers haven't been able to do."
2.0,"I bought this item because of its reputation. At first I was very pleased with the item, it was making laps around the yard, and seemed to be doing great. So one night I drug my hose around, and made my nice track, and put the shutoff about 15 ft from the end of the hose. Well, I got up the next morning, and it was still going. It had come off the track, and had run into the flowerbed. Needless to say it was stuck. Just so you know I was using a 5/8"" heavy duty hose, so I really wouldn't think it would jump off track. Now the gears are stripped and I had to order a new motor from Nelson. Cost me $23 for a new motor. Oh and did I mention this was only 2 weeks after I purchased the product. I love the product, and the concept just hate the plastic gears!"
5.0,Great way to water your lawn. It takes a little work but good things don't come easy. The shut off works very well and makes it easier to water.
1.0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nelson-1865-Raintrain-Traveling-Sprinkler/dp/B00002N6AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nelson 1865 Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler</a>

If the Nelson Raintrain Traveling Sprinkler didn't have plastic gears in its transmission I would give it a 5 star rating. I've purchase my second Nelson Raintrain now with the plastic gears failing in both trains. I seem to only get a season out of this product before it fails. In my opinion the gears are engineered to break easily under normal conditions forcing one to purchase this item again and again. I did find a web site that sells replacement transmissions with the price tag of a little over half what a new Nelson train would cost, I just couldn't bring myself purchasing the same cheap transmission that will inevitably fail again.

After reading the reviews on the Rittenhouse Walking Sprinkler,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walking-Sprinkler-Cast-Iron/dp/B0002PB214/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walking Sprinkler - Cast Iron</a>, that is the sprinkle I will have doing the job next. They are heavy-duty, cast iron construction, metal gears, and made in the USA. I will be money ahead in the long run.

Sorry Nelson, my hard earned cash will be staying in the USA this time."
2.0,"Note that the positive reviews for the Nelson Rain Train are generally 9 or 10 years old.  Some newer reviews complain about the low durability and the plastic gears that fail after less--often far less--than 2 seasons of use.  This implies to me that sturdy internal gears made of metal were replaced with flimsy ones made of nylon around 10 - 12 years ago.
  I have two of the newer units (the only kind available in recent years), and they routinely stop functioning after around a season of use.  This is despite the fact that I live in northwest Oregon, where the watering season is short.  The innards (transmissions) are available from Nelson, but are very annoying to replace because of the way the wheels are attached: they use clips that cost a couple of cents but are nearly impossible to remove.
  If you have a yard whose shape requires this kind of sprinkler and whose slope is not very great, you can get good use out of one of these with the understanding that you will have to replace the insides each year.  If the replacement task were not so onerous as to make me hate the manufacturer, I would give 3 stars."
5.0,I love this sprinkler. I have a huge yard and would often get distracted and forget to move the sprinkler. Now I can set it and get other things done while it moves itself. Very Happy
4.0,This Rain Train works great when you have windy weather as you can adjusdt the arms to water lower and not the AIR..  It does help if you can keep it on the hose.  Needs a large curve to remain over the hose.
4.0,"I bought this sprinkler two years ago.  It is now broken too badly to be repaired.  The casing is a nice, heavy steel.  Unfortunately, the parts that move are plastic and break over time.  The knob at the bottom that shuts the sprinkler off broke last year.  Now, the hose fitting is cracked too badly to use.  I will buy another one since I don't know of anything better."
5.0,Oh so much better than all the plastic crap nozzles that don't work well in the first place and soon don't work at all.  This is the old fashioned spray pistol I like so much and it can easily water plants gently or wash the car or walkway or outside windows with good pressure...
4.0,"I have been using this for well over a year with no major issues. Only slight annoyance has been that there is a rubber sealing gasket that has started to fall out after every use, hence me only giving it four stars."
5.0,"I purchased this to go along with a Water Right Coil hose. They are both super durable, and a recommended combination. "
5.0,"These are great nozzles, 'I'm always having problems with the cheapos breaking and clogging"
5.0,Good all metal sprayer. Much better then the plastic stuff that only last a few months.
5.0,As advertised.
5.0,Excellent nozzle
5.0,A sturdy traditional hose nozzle.  Should last at least 10 years.
4.0,Decent quality.  Still has some plastic parts.
5.0,"After trying several plastic nozzles that kept breaking, I went to this.  I loved it, until the plumber stole it.  Now I'm buying another one .  Best choice for run of the mill use."
5.0,"Wow, I am so impressed with this traveling sprinkler. Not having an automatic sprinkler system, I tried every other manual sprinkler imaginable. A friend recommended the Raintrane and said he used it with great success back in the 70s/80s. So I decided to give it a try, and now the Raintrain is my BEST BUDDY. I am about to order another one for the back yard. Laying the track is fun and yes, it is addicting watching the Raintrain out of the windows as he maneuvers through the track. Highly recommend this product."
5.0,I was so glad to find a Nelson Raintrain...I still have my original one from 7 years ago and it still works great... We have over an acre to water and needed more. I bought another brand locally and have had to replace it three times now. the Nelson is a true work horse!!!
5.0,"You can turn on this little train sprinkler, let it run and forget about it.  It stops on its own where you have set it to stop, no wasting water. You can make it water far and wide or only a narrow space by adjusting the water pressure. It does a far better and carefree job than any of the others sprinlers we have used over the years. Well worth the money!"
4.0,"This is the second Nelson Rain Train that I've owned.  The first just gave out from a combination of time, weather, and neglect.  I replaced it with a knock off.  Big mistake.  This unit is heavier, is more ""sure footed"" (doesn't get stuck), stays on track, and turns itself off when it hits the stop.

The Raintrain, for those that haven't used one, follows the garden hose around your yard.  The movement of the sprinkler head drives the wheels, which moves the entire unit.  If you have a larger or odd shaped yard it makes keeping it watered much easier.  The ""auto off"" nature of the sprinkler saves water and you don't have to get up at midnight after you realized you left the sprinkler on."
5.0,This product is really great. You can really customize it to your specific needs. I would absolutely recommend this product.
1.0,"what a colossal loser this was.  i have a level front yard.  i set it up right, all i asked it to do was follow the freaking hose line like it was supposed to.  this POS rain train never left the station.  it traveled a mighty 3 feet before promptly flopping over and fixing one wand of spray on my open study window.  repeated attempts with different hoses in different areas (with windows now shut) were met with equal failure.

i'd rather stand in the yard and take 8 hours and hand water it than use this loser again.  my grandfather warned me not to get this and he was right.  sounds great in theory, works like !@#$T^!@# in reality.

the only joy i got out of this thing was after 2 months when i couldn't take it anymore and heaved it as high as I could in the street and let it come crashing down until it was destroyed.  i couldn't bear to foist it off as a freebie to one of my neighbors or even my worst enemy."
5.0,"I needed some replacement parts for my sprinkler. The manufacturer's parts were on back-order. So I ordered a used one to use for parts. It was about half the price of a new one, with the shipping. It is in such condition that I'm going to use it and let the old one provide any needed spare parts. I'm pleased. Thanks!"
4.0,"You know that this sprinkler is the real deal when you open the box and try to lift the thing out of the box. It has some serious weight to it! People love to watch it (myself included) and it takes care of itself once you take the time to lay the hose out in your yard. This sprinkler is not for you if you are planting new grass and have bare dirt showing. With how slow the tractor moves it will make mud, get stuck, and possibly strip the gears costing you additional money. You can effectively lay out ~200' of hose however it may take a few ""derailments"" before you figure out how to arrange the hose. The turns need to be broad and, if pulling a decent amount of hose, it can jump the track and could end up in the street. It does come with an auto-shutoff ramp however if you intend to operate the sprinkler without supervision buy a timer so that in the event that it doesn't shutoff you don't flood your yard... or your neighbor's yard. Get ready for your water bill to go up because you'll want to use this sprinkler all the time!"
4.0,"For the most part this works pretty good. I bought the John Deere and this one, they both work the same. This is the first time I am waterin my lawn, so to me it seems like they use a lot of water, especially in narrow areas. They are better made for large areas, for narrow corridors, use some other system."
4.0,"Sprinkler works great and is a super time saver.  Couple it with an automatic timer and you're ready to go.

Downside:  Being on a private well with varying water pressure, the sprinkler, even at ""High Speed"", takes quite a while to traverse the lawn.  I have it setup to do a run of approximately 100' which will cover about a 140' section of lawn at a width of 40' takes about 4 hour's.  Much slower than advertised.

Note, the wider the path, the slower it moves as the sprikler is driven by the water spraying from the arms.

Overall I do recommend this product and with the free shipping from Amazon it arrived in 4 days."
4.0,Its quality is so nice that I expected.
5.0,Love these pruning shears.  I have ridiculous arthritis but can use this without any problem.  Keep in mind that they're made for pruning - not for cutting down trees.  Perfect for trimming rose bushes and other bushes or cutting flowers.  I have had no problem with the locking system as some people had mentioned.
4.0,Fiskars is a quality brand. This tool effectively cuts through young bamboo and other weeds.
1.0,NOT FISKARS BRAND. I got some generic shears. Sending it back.
1.0,We received the pruners today in the mail and they are clearly NOT Fiskars brand!! The brand is Gardners.
5.0,"The Fiskars do the job of trimming quite well.  I think the real test is how long they last, but so far, they're great..  I've always been impress with my Fiskars products, and so far, the pruning shears are doing well."
5.0,I love these! purchased to spruce up around our new home.  the yard was left over grown and poorly cared for when we acquired the house! Tons of overgrowth and out of control plants.  These shears works great and they are tough! I was surprised to find how thick of a brach they would cut through. very happy.
5.0,Best item ever
5.0,"These shears are exactly as described. They are nice and sharp with an easy to operate safety. Living under 4 large oak trees we constantly have scrub oaks popping up and if we aren't diligent can find ourselves with quite a stand of scrub brush underneath. These shears made quick work of it.

I will keep them handy in my gardening box. Thank you again for offering them under Prime."
4.0,Job done and seem pretty decent quality.
5.0,"I ordered this for my sons birthday and he is extreamly happy it does all it should do and saves them from having to stand and water everdya.

great product."
5.0,Excellent.  Item was well packed---no damage during shipping.  It was easy to put together and it has worked without any problems.  I am very pleased with it!
4.0,"Ok, I'll admit that I like to watch the thing go 'round and round.  That said, it is well made of some sort of cast metal.  The plastic wheels were a bit of a disappointment but they do have likely better traction than a metal wheel would. It has adjustable spray arms that are great if you have a lot of wind.  The spray stays close to the ground and doesn't blow away.  On our well w/ 50 psi it has a spray diameter of about 30'"
5.0,"This is a great water and time saver once you get the hang of how to route your water hose and set the spray arms.  The Nelson 1865 Traveling Sprinkler is much better than the ones they are selling in stores now. It is made of cast iron and has a hand hold for ease of moving around. The box on the ones selling in all stores I checked had a picture of one with the hand hold but after I bought one and got it home it is a totally different style. It was made of some type plastice and was filled with concrete with no hand hold which made it much harder to pick up and move around. Thanks for still having the good old cast iron sprinklers around, and I suggest Nelson change the Picture on their packaging."
5.0,The Nelson Traveling Sprinkler has saved us since we do not have a sprinkler system.  We love it!
5.0,"Our weather here on the Texas Gulf Coast had no appreciable rain for three months. I have a lot of lawn and really needed a traveling sprinkler.  My first inclination was one made by John Deere, but the reviews were not good. After reading about the other sprinklers, I chose the Nelson and am not sorry I did.  It is sturdy, well constructed and does the job it was made to do. I would highly recommend it.
George"
5.0,"I am really pleased with this sprinkler. Is it perfect? No. I don't think that the perfect sprinkler exists. There are just too many variables for one sprinkler to cover. The Nelson Raintrain can do a very deep watering of a large area, without requiring my attention or intervention. At the same time, it doesn't appear to use as much water as many other sprinklers. I bought this as part of a project to redo our lawn, which is divided into two distinct areas. At first, I was only using this sprinkler on one area, and used other sprinklers to water the other area. The area that I watered with the Nelson Raintrain thrived. The other area, not so much. When I started using the Nelson sprinkler on both areas, they both began to thrive, and I didn't need to water as often as before. The promotional information for the Nelson indicates that it can pull up to 100' of hose. That may be true after my grass develops better roots and becomes a turf, but with the thinner young grass, the sprinkler will only pull about 40 feet of hose before the rear wheels begin digging holes. That can be extended to 50-60 feet by using the cheap, light weight, shiny vinyl hose, instead of the good quality heavy rubber hose. Once the grass forms into a turf, making it more difficult for the wheels to dig in and providing more traction, I'm sure that it will pull more hose. Adding weight to the sprinkler might help too. All things considered, I'm very satisfied with this sprinkler, and will probably buy another."
5.0,"I've had to replace broken gears in my Rain Train twice in the last twenty years or so.  Both times the gears teeth were broken at only one place on either one or two gears.  They were not worn down from use.  The last time they broke, I had moved the sprinkler from the back yard to the front yard.  I gently, or what I thought was gently, tossed the sprinkler about a two feet where I was going to start watering, hooked up the hose, and the sprinkler wouldn't move.  I realized that when I had tossed it and it landed on the rear wheels, the heavy weight of the sprinkler had put a lot of torque on the plastic gears and sheared off the teeth.  I broke my sprinkler; it didn't break from use.  From now on, I hope I remember to set it down without putting a lot of torque on the rear wheels."
5.0,"My Raintrain is a wonderful sprinkler.  I use it with a timer and all I have to do is turn on the water and it takes care of itself.  Good price.  You will not be disappointed.  It was shipped and here for use within 3 days, and has been working everyday since then."
5.0,"We are in the middle of construction and as such our irragation system is offline for several months.
We ordered two of the Raintrain tractors and they have worked just as advertised. (We use 5/8"" hose)
Too tight a curve in the hose will cause the tractor to ""jump the track"" and continue in a straight line but we quickly learned how to position the hoses so that didn't happen.
We have noticed that one of the tractors is slower than the other but both have worked without problem since they arrived. I really like the simplicity of the design, easy to setup, use and move around the yard. Great Product!"
2.0,Not the Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle your grandpa used. This hunk of pot metal is painted a glossy battleship grey. It works. I didn't have time to send it back or I would have.
5.0,Sometimes the old designs are the best. No leaks and just works
5.0,"It's perfect. Don't waste your time with one of those nozzles that have a dozen different settings, just adjust your pressure a little bit and this will hit everything from a high pressure jet stream to a fanned out spray. There's a reason these have been around for so long, because they work!"
5.0,love this sprayer. much better than the cheaper plastic ones. only thing is there is no settings like the cheaper plastic ones but it works much better with a stronger stream for sure.
5.0,Perfect noze. Works smoothly. It's alot better than other similar type nozzles.
5.0,"No complaints. I have it connected to a short hose (~3 feet) on my porch spigot so I can fill my watering cans mostly. It seems well made for a basic sprayer. No complicated settings or patterns. Nothing to break, really. Withstands strong pressure, when needed."
5.0,Works better than the fancy ones I've tried.
5.0,Good nozzle. I hooked it up and it works exactly as it's supposed to. Looks fairly heavy duty.
5.0,"Excellent quality. Feels very solid, and water comes out evenly distributed."
5.0,Simple and reliable...no fancy spraying options
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, this are very sharp and a good price."
5.0,"I've used them pretty hard for about a year now, and they still cut as well as they did when new.  I couldn't ask for anything better in such a small, easy to use size."
5.0,Good quality.  Great price!
5.0,Very sharp.  Easy on the hands
5.0,Works great in the garden. Easily cuts tree branches and shrubs.
5.0,"I love fiskars! cuts through big branches easily, does not hurt my hands to use, foam grip does not disintegrate or fall apart (after a few weeks)"
5.0,These are amazing.  They cut so great without any problems.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,a professional product  works great
5.0,"These are great garden shears. I have had them for several months now, and the finish has held up (granted I have kept them in the garage, not outdoors all season). I have had other brands in the past begin rusting in the garage over winter. Its always a disappointment to take them out in the spring and find damaged tools. With spring finally arriving, I have recently taken them out of the tool bench and they are in the same condition as when I bought them, despite use in the fall to clean up the yard. These are great for trimming back small branches of overhanging trees or pruning shrubs or plants. I'd highly recommend these or anything from the Fiskars Garden Tool line based on my experience."
1.0,"I thought this would be great for my yard but I set it out and it would move only about one foot per hour. I contacted Nelson and they sent a new motor which I installed. Now the sprinkler doesn't move at all. I suspect my water flow is not sufficient to drive this thing, as my house is about 55 years old with iron pipe that is somewhat occluded.

DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM unless you have a newer house with no flow or pressure problems. And don't buy from Amazon unless you are sure it will work because Amazon has a poor return policy.

UPDATE September 23, 2009: After replacing the motor under warranty I still didn't get sufficient water through the arms to move the sprinkler. So I took it apart, again, and discovered a manufacturing defect in the ""T"" that the arms come out of. The hole had not been drilled through all the way. I called customer service and they are sending a new one out. In the meantime I drilled it out myself and am happy to say it is working as it should. The rating system won't let me change my rating from a one star but I would now rate the sprinkler as a 5 star. Of course, the season is over now so I'm somewhat less than thrilled, but looking forward to spring."
5.0,"Best sprinkler I have ever used.  The tractor is heavy  but I have a very large lawn, 1-1/3 acre, once I set it up all I have to do is move the hose every couple of hours and it just keeps trucking on.  Adjustable as to the sprinkler area covered and speed of tractor so you can get just about amount of water coverage you want.  This is my second one and they lasted over 15 years.  Well worth the price if you have a large area to water."
3.0,"THE  SPRINKLER  COVERS A GOOD AREA  BUT DOES NOT DO WELL ON EVEN SMALL INCLINES OR UP HILL IT JUMPS THE HOSE AND WONDERS THE  YARD AND  CAN WIND UP IN NEIGHBORS  YARD OR UP AGAINST A TREE AND  STRIP THE  GEARS AND IT WILL NOT  TRAVEL ANY  MORE YOU NEED TO WATCH IT  CLOSELY
 BUT IF YOU USE IT ON  STRAIGHT  FLAT AND  NOT TO MANY  CURVES IT PERFORMS WELL
 IT IS  ALSO VERY HEAVY  SO IF YOU HAVE A BACK PROBLEM I'D PASS ON THIS  KIND OF SPRINKLER LOTS OF  BENDING AND  RELOCATING IT
I GOT THEM BECAUSE I HAD INSTALLED NEW SOD AND  HAD TO WATER EVERY DAY FOR 2  WEEKS I HAD NO SPRINKLING SYSTEM  AND IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE .
L BARNARD"
4.0,"It's sturdy, easy to use and enables us to hit all the brown spots our sprinkler system misses without running outside to move the sprinkler every few minutes.  Only problem we've run in to is if you have poor water pressure, it won't go.  Our community is struggling with that problem due to mechanical difficulties this year, so sometimes we can't use it due to that.  Otherwise we're very pleased."
5.0,Works very well.  Can run water for hours with this sprinkler.  I've been very pleased
5.0,"Because a neighbor had one and loves it, I bought two; one for the front yard and one for the back. This is the coolest contraption since the George Foreman Grill.

I am amazed at how well it works. This is no flimsy piece of hardware; I estimate it to weigh about 25 lbs. Thus far, I only have 2 suggestions: It would be nice if there was a way to allow the RainTrain to work if you connect two hoses together. The other is to include stickers (like those in a model car kit) so you can customize your RainTrain."
2.0,"THe thing worked only a short time per attempt before it went off the track or the sprinkler arms blew off from the water pressure.  Can't turn up the water pressure above half on without a ""blow out"" occuring.  Got tired of fooling with the darn thing and sold it on e-bay.  I lost a little money but at least the old-fashined oscillating sprinker worked and worked very well.  I would not recommend this sprinkler to anyone."
2.0,"I got a Nelson Raintrain to water irregular lawn areas.  It looks great at first, shiny yellow body of massive heft, but things get much more problematic when you actually use it over time.
THE GOOD--The unit worked well for three months when it travelled over densely thatched lawn with no blemishes or irregularities.  Then there is the real world of real lawns.  Here's what I found.
THE BAD--If the lawn has a gap 2-3 inches or more between solid grass, one wheel would dig down and spin, digging deeper and deeper.  The unit would stop, and occasionally tip over.  The manual said such a scenario is likely to strip the gears, but mine did not. You must exercise extreme caution using the Nelson Raintrain with newly sodded ground, as gaps in the sod will cause this problem.
You cannot use it on newly seeded lawns, as it will dig into the mud for reasons described just above.
Past about 60 feet the hose becomes too heavy to drag, so the unit occasionally stops and more likely tips it over if there's much of any turn.
If  there is a sharp turn with radius less than about 5 feet, the unit sometimes jumps the hose and heads off on its own, stalling somewhere.
The amount of water delivered has only two settings, high and low speed, whereas the average user may need more variation and control.
The overall amount of water deposited may be too light.  The streams of water rather thin, so the reviewer who said the total accumulation for both travel speeds was  inch was likely correct.  I want to touch up after a light rain and soak it when I have new sod.
Very occasionally one of the sprinkler arms would be thrown off.
You cannot use a timer with this unit more than once, as you must reposition the travelling unit before each run.  If you need to go away for a few days, this defect can be critical.  I must take two trips this Summer and water $800 of new sod, so I just bought a bunch of new watering equipment from Amazon.
You cannot adjust the sprinkler heads, which are fixed, from a stream to a mist.  They really deliver more of a stream than a spray.  The pattern they deliver is not even, but when it travels it will be except at the beginning and end of the run.
Often they break.  If the reviews here at Amazon are any guide, likely over time they break, but not usually in the first few months.  Mine simply stopped spraying water after three months.  When I determined the water passages outside the gearbox were clear, I read the Amazon reviews and threw the unit out.  I would have spent a couple hours repairing it the first time; it would likely have broken again; I am leaving on a trip before replacement parts could be in place; and I can't use this unit with timers in any case for trips.
The massive metal body is a wonder to behold but the entire rest of the unit is lightweight aluminum and plastic.  I found myself taking great care putting the unit down in my shed, afraid I might bump and bend the lightweight aluminum sprinkler arms.
For all the reasons above, you must keep an eye on this unit every half hour or so or you are taking a chance.
In summary, the Nelson Raintrain is a neat idea for watering irregular lawn areas but too mechanically complex for the task.  It has enough design flaws that they would likely not be corrected even if the mechanisms were more sturdy.  Instead I'd recommend an alternative strategy with more reliability and the same or less cost.
THE ALTERNATIVES--To water my irregular areas I am switching to more standard sprinklers daisy chained together with short hoses.  I can leave these fixed and use timers.  The highly rated products on Amazon I plan to get are:
*Nelson Adjustable Pattern Control Gear Drive Sprinkler with Flow Control on Rezimar Wheel Base #50250, likely the best sprinkler but it does not have a built-in inlet and outlet, so I'll put it as the last one in my daisy chain.
*Nelson 50230 - Whirling Vane Sprinkler, has inlet and outlet built-in
*Nelson oscillating sprinklers
*Nelson Triple Spray
And for the timer I'm getting
*Orbit 62001 Lawn & Garden Hose Digital Watering Timer And Valve"" Tools & Hardware"
2.0,"I tried to use this on my brand new lawn which was seeded (i.e., not sodded).  This was a bad idea and did not work.  As soon as the ground beneath the Rain Train was damp, the front wheels started to sink into the ground.  Before long, it stopped moving forward and the front wheels were completely sunk in.

Because this thing is pretty heavy and the front wheels are very narrow, I cannot imagine this being usable for new seed-based lawns.  Maybe it would work fine with sod.

I will clean the mud off and store it in my garage until I have grass and try again and update my rating (probably next spring).  Back to pulsating rotary sprinklers!  I'm trying my luck with this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-Extra-Large-Coverage-Sprinkler-999ZS/dp/B0006U669I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour Extra Large Coverage Sprinkler #999ZS</a>"
5.0,"It does take some time getting used to setting up the sprinkler, but after a couple of times, I know the drill.  Had a problem with one of the arms, and emailed Nelson regarding same.  They were quick and courteous regarding replacing the part.  Since water restrictions are looming in South Texas, plan on getting a lot of use out of this handy gadget."
5.0,great tool
5.0,"Does its job well. I have used it to cut flowers till now. No branches yet. I ave used it to cut a lot of plastic zip ties, where my scissors wouldnt work. It has a safety lock which is great."
3.0,"Pretty good for $10. The blade does leave a gap and twist to the side a bit if a twig is not positioned far enough in. I'm hoping this does not loosen up the blade further with more use. Good size and sharpness, no strap for holding or hanging the shears for storage."
5.0,perfect
4.0,Product meets my needs.  Very satisfied.
5.0,i love these and i love fiskars because if they break you send them a photo and they send you a new pair.  i use them all the time and they are comfortable to use and easy to lock
5.0,Great scissors for gardening or light pruning around the yard!
5.0,A major upgrade from the rusty old hand-me-down shears I was using. This makes pruning very easy. I like the locking mechanism for storage as well.
5.0,These are awesome! I highly recommend!
5.0,"A+++, will buy again from he seller"
5.0,Great feel. Great function. Works great on the job site. Feel like these will stand the test of time and medium abuse.
5.0,"This one works even when you leave it outside in freezing temps. I had another brand and I couldn't,  but this one is okay."
3.0,"Sturdy. I wish you could chance to more kinds of spray. It will get stronger or weaker but you can't switch it to shower, mist, etc. It's basically jet or cone. Not ideal for watering small pots."
4.0,Works well
4.0,Hard to use if your hands are slippery.
5.0,Works fine. Does its job.
5.0,"Awesome nozzle. I wash my cars often and was looking for something simple, durable, and not too expensive. This fit my criteria very well. Also comes with a washer so there is no water leakage when the Nozzle is attached to a hose.

Pros:
-Durable (Constant dropping on the concrete and no breakage so far)
-Simple to use with no extra unnecessary nozzle modes
-Produces strong water pressure (enough to remove tough dirt and grime on my vehicles)
-Great price!

Cons:
-None that I can find

Would definitely recommend."
5.0,"This is surprisingly light, and tends to feel less like metal and more like plastic. It does appear to be of good quality, however, and I'm happy I purchased it. It really only has two settings, which is a low mist, and a hard stream. I've found that this covered my needs well enough.

For the price, it's hard to beat."
5.0,good ole metal instead of cheap plastic
5.0,I have had ever hose head ever made - literally maybe 100 over my lifetime. - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET. It's been around forever for a reason.
1.0,"I bought this sprinkler in 2008 to water an acre or more of grass, only to have it 'derail' and get stuck - subsequently stripping the cheap plastic gears.  So, I replaced it and last I knew, at the end of the season it worked fine.  Well, it's now 2009, I just set it out for the first time  and the gears appear to be stripped again for some unknown reason.  I won't be buying this model again until the gears are as sturdy as the tractor!"
1.0,"I have a 1/2 acre lawn, and most is on a gentle slope.
If I try to go sideways, it fell over EASILY (top heavy/too narrow)!

Even when I go up/down, it falls over at the slightest bare spot!
It also commonly does not shutoff when it gets to the ramp- goes a ways & falls over.
The stuck sprinkler arms often dig a large hole, when it falls over!
~~~

I finally gave up & had a Rainbird buried system professionally installed-
I have to replace 3/4 broken Rainbird heads a year (usually discovered after I see large dead spots!)!
The Rainbird heads ""supposedly"" have a 5-year warranty, but the ""only"" local authorized dealer balks at replacing them (I show him the installation receipt too!).
Catch22!- If I TRY & complain to Rainbird, the refer me back flaky dealer!

It is now a mix of Rainbird/Hunter heads.
I have only had the new Hunter heads section a year, and I hope they last longer/more dependable!?
The Rainbird heads cover MUCH better though, and hope their new model replacement heads last better (no new ones bad in 2-years?)?

I wish I could offer you a more viable solution!?"
1.0,"i specifically bought this sprinkler because the description above clearly stated that it was made in the USA. however, the sprinkler that arrived was made in CHINA, not the USA.
thanks a lot, nelson, for betraying your customers and your American employees."
4.0,"So far so good, got this last week and it's been used a bunch.  It had trouble in the sand and also in some light Florida muck. After a hard learned lesson, I keep an eye on it through the first run finding little hang-ups. after finding a problem I make an adjustment of the hose route.  A couple of times the arm came off and lost a bunch of water as it gushed out of the hole. The arms just popped right in and back to work.  The stopper worked pretty good but it does leak.  A good back-up is using a timer in conjunction with the sprinkler.  I'm considering a second for the back yard, so yes if you spend time moving sprinklers, I would recommend this.

2012 Update..Had to buy a replacement. after hours and miles of use it finally stopped working. We have hard water so I'm guessing that has something to do with it.  One hint is that while I run this on about 200' of hose, I pull the extra hose from the back to the front and never have to stop.  What happens is that when the sprinkler starts dragging too much hose the wheels dig themselves into a rut...so about every hour to an hour and a half I pull the hose back up... Good sprinkler !!!!"
3.0,"I need to check the connections and pressure still, but having set everything up last night for the first time, I was dissapointed at the slow speed of the unit.  I even adjusted the arms to maximize speed, but it was still crawling.  Pools of water were forming in its path so I'm not sure if I'll be able to continue using it unless I can figure out how to speed it up."
5.0,I bought this two summers ago so that I didn't have to move sprinklers around all day. An underground sprinkler system was not an option. This works great. I do have to move it a few times to cover different parts of my yard. It covers a big portion of my yard without me moving a sprinkler every 15 minutes. It follows the hose very well and shuts off just fine when it reaches the ramp. Ocassionally the rear drive tires do dig a whole in the lawn. This usually happens if the grass is too tall when watering and it is pulling a lot of hose. Other than that no complaints. I actually picked up another one at a yard sale for $10. One for the front yard one for the back. I am very happy with how they work.
5.0,"This sprinkler was the best solution for my need to frequently water a newly-seeded lawn.  It waters a 50+ ft. wide path where you lay out your hose.  The only limit is how much hose it can drag behind it.  When it reaches that limit, the wheels just dig into the dirt and the heavy sprinkler eventually shuts off it's water valve on the bottom."
5.0,"This sprinkler works great.  It has great coverage.  The only thing I would change is the max speed.  It does have a two speed gearbox, however high gear is still not very fast."
5.0,"The Nelson Raintrain is by far the best sprinkler I've ever owned.
I recommend it to everyone, including friends and family."
5.0,I have a big yard and this was a wonderful sprinkler to place in the yard and let it wander slowly across watering as it goes.
5.0,"This product is terrific!!  I really don't get some of the reviews I've read recently.  Some say it's heavy. Well, by design, it has to be.  Some say it's difficult to use.  Well, if you consider laying a hose across your yard difficult, then I guess it is.  Look- this thing does EXACTLY what it says it does.  You can adjust the spray pattern by adjusting the spray arms.  You can control the speed.  If you have enough hose, you can wrap it around your lawn and water every inch of grass.  And the automatic stop-ramp works like a charm.  I'm thrilled with mine!  It's a lot cheaper than an in-ground sprinkler system, and just as effective.  OK, it's a little more work, agreed, but it's worth it.  Don't hesitate to buy this product.  You won't regret it!"
4.0,"My traveling sprinkler is not a rain train, but is very similar, including in its faults.  It covers large areas very nicely and evenly, but fails to stop of make turns very well.  I have found some work arounds that help.

For making turns, I put hose guides into the ground (3 for a 90 degree turn).  These are the inexpensive hose guides that have a stake on the bottom and a reel on top.  They catch the hose and keep it pulling strait behind the sprinkler so it doesn't topple.  Space them evenly through a wide turn, at the same level as the hose.

For stopping I tossed the stoppers that came with the sprinkler.  They don't stop it and more oven derail it.  Instead I use a water timer.  Also cheap, it does a much better job of stopping the traveling sprinkler, (with a little practice.)

With these work arounds, my sprinkler is a very useful tool."
5.0,Set the path correctly. Set a timer at the hose and forget about it. Works very efficiently.
4.0,This product is great!!  You don't have to worry about watering your lawn this does it for you.  It seems to stay on track and stops when it needs to.
5.0,This is a great sprinkler!  It works great for us and covers a lot of area without coninually moving hoses.  You can just lay the hose out and watch this little tractor proceed to water the yard.  The auto stop allows you to set where you want the watering to end.  The Raintrain is heavy and well built and can handle all different types of terrain.  Highly recommended.
5.0,Sprinkler is workng well so far. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I like the fact that you can adjust how fast it goes (2 speeds) and how far the sprinkler sprays.
4.0,"This sprinkler works fairly well.  It allows me to set it up once and get my whole yard watered.  It will occasionally jump off track and begin to wander around, but 9 out of 10 times it follows the hose and completes its journey without any problems. It has only once failed to stop when it reached the stopping device.  So I would recommend this sprinkler to get the job done."
5.0,This product was received in 2 days. Perfect condition and works beautifully.  Realy enjoying it.  It follows the hose as advertised.
5.0,This is a nice sprinkler. I works great if you have a large area to cover. Not so great for small yards.
5.0,"This is one of the BEST sprinklers on the market!  I just bought my second one! and it works great, just like the 1st one which was purchased back in 1972, yes you read that right 1972, and it still works GREAT!"
4.0,"It does what I needed it to do. Its good for small to medium trimming/pruning jobs in your garden. Made well enough to last a season or three, if you don't leave it out in the weather, for Petes sake, as I have done in the past!

Would recommend it..."
4.0,nice Pruning shears.  They are sharp and ready to cut. I use them in gardening and to cut the stalks for flower arrangements. Work Great.
5.0,I purchased this and have been using it for the past 4 months.  No problems.  Prunes the rose bushes very nicely.  Very good price.
4.0,"Pretty good, cuts light branches well, sticks a bit"
5.0,"Read the reviews... I purchased to maintain my lemon & lime plants I keep in planters on my balcony. They're about 2ft tall and need regular pruning mainly due to being in containers. These shears makes pruning thick tough branches like cutting butter. Also, really like the easy safety latch - thought they'd be like scissors and just stay closed but the safety feature is thoughtful & smart. Would definitely purchase again"
5.0,I love these! Wore out first pair after years of hard use. Easy to use and cut anything...delivered in a flash!
5.0,Best shears I've ever used
5.0,These are great shears.
5.0,A very fine set of trimmers that you will be very pleased with
2.0,"It worked great at the beginning, but now, just 2 1/2 months later the blades are already very dull...That's disappointing!!!"
5.0,Great nozzle.
5.0,"Great quality. Metal construction. Only has one function, but works great and made well"
5.0,"Old school and reliable.
Incredibly industrial build quality.
I expect these to last for years and years."
4.0,"Used a couple of cable ties to hold foam pipe insulation over body of unit so the cold of the water doesn't transfer so easily to your hand. This is a good value as it throws a fairly uniform spray pattern as opposed to many of those ""fire hose nozzle"" units. It's not a premium unit, with a cheap handle but it works well enough for the price point."
5.0,"Works really well, especially considering the low price"
3.0,Metal tab to hold sprayer open will definitely fall off (happened to both of mine). Their spray nozzle is far superior.
5.0,"Great nozzle for outdoor hose.  Does not have that annoying water saver feature.  Powerful stream of water is what I wanted and
that is what I received."
5.0,"Nice solid sprayer.  Used it as a replacement for my Gilmour Foam gun.  Works better than original, and seems more durable.  Happy with purchase."
5.0,"Provides a great spray of water. It was very afforable and easy to use. After two summers the finish has faded, but the nozle itself works great."
5.0,It works. It doesn't leak. I don't know what else to tell you.
5.0,"This is just what the doctor ordered for my large corner lot.  I can set in on slow speed and spread the pattern to cover that corner in one application.  It stops automatically at the end of the run and gives me up to 1"" of coverage.  I use a separate hose for the ""rail"" and attach that to a shutoff valve which allows me to shut of the water, then unhook the sprinkler without getting wet because of the pressure in the hose."
2.0,"Had to replace a very durable old Thompson traveling sprinkler after it got under the wheels of our car.  Selected this Nelson sprinkler after reading unfavorable reviews of the durability of some other traveling sprinklers.  I got about ten hours' use out of it before it self destructed.  It stalled over its stopping ramp pulling only about 15 feet of 5/8"" hose.  I found it running there, making snapping noises, with transmission gears stripped.  Critiquing it from my engineering background, it has two major flaws that led to self destruction.  The stopping ramp is inadequately designed for stability on freshly mown St. Augustine grass turf, and the transmission gears are made of a plastic that is obviously not strong enough to provide any reasonable job survivability margin.  Wording in the user manual which you don't get to read until after you've bought the sprinkler, indicates that Nelson engineers and management are fully aware of the overly fragile nature of the transmission in this sprinkler.  Bear in mind that our Thompson traversed this lawn for years with no problem.  Another shortcoming of this sprinkler is that it doesn't lay down enough water for a once weekly watering schedule in brutal southwestern summer weather.  The old Thompson had that same flaw, which I remedied by enlarging the end orifices on its sprinkler arms.

Fortunately the ruined Nelson transmission is under warranty, but I had to pay the shipping expense to return it to their repair shop.  After the warranty expires, transmissions are available for about $14 a pop, plus shipping, but who needs the burden of a product that isn't sturdy enough to outlast its warranty?

R Blankenship"
1.0,"Ordered a month ago. Received with a part missing.  Returned unit and still waiting for a replacement.  No money no product.  Still waiting for a response to email.  The vendor seems to have a good bit of negative feedback
that should have cautioned me.  When these sort of things happen, I without business (Amazon) until the matter is resolved."
5.0,"I don't review anything, but this thing rocks...you have to get it if your even thinking about it, I do 100 ft of yard each night w/ this thing."
5.0,"I purchased this sprinkler as a replacement for my 19 year old Nelson Raintrain.  It is far superior to my old one.  Of course, I don't really rember how good it was in '89.  The only problem I've had is the one they warn you about - it sometimes gets off the track when using a 1/2"" hose.  That never happens when using a 7/8""."
5.0,Love it! Saves you from having to move your sprinkler around all day to get every spot.
5.0,I have a U-shaped backyard on a golf course.  It was impossible to water in fewer than three separate sprinkler setups.  The Raintrain solved my problems.  One setup and off we go.  The only problem I have encountered is that I have to redirect the sprinkler heads to cover a narrower area for the final 50 feet.  I just wish I had purchased one of these sooner.
5.0,"My husband loves the rain train.  It waters our yard so well, and we live in Houston, TX, so it gets hot here, and we have lots of yard and landscaping.  The rain train is easy to use, and we still have a 20 year old rain train from his parents that won't stop.  This is a high quality product."
1.0,"I purchased this unit and payed the hefty one day expidite fee. When it arrived I was very excited until I opened the box and discovered the threaded coupling that holds the sprinkler arm on was missing. I called Nelson as instructed by the insert in the box and they told me it would take 2 weeks to get the part. I asked for a supervisor hoping she'd understand that I paid extra and needed this quickly. With NO apologies or sympathies offered for costing me extra or for the inconvience, she cooly said 2 weeks was the best they could do because they were so backed up. I guess with that type of business, losing one customer like me doesn't matter to them, so beware if you need replacment parts or your order arrives with missing parts!

I am upset and disappointed with Nelson!"
4.0,"I've had a couple of ""hose jumping"" incidents but otherwise works as advertised. I think it would be best for flat lawns with easy curves for the machine to negotiate. I wouldn't suggest leaving the device totally unattended until you know your set up works. Even then, I'd keep an occasional eye on it. This sprinkler really does save  time by moving itself and does motor along like a little tractor!"
3.0,"just okay, they don't open very far so they're very hard to use when cutting offsets from plants. They also occasionally stick, I had to get a 2nd pair."
5.0,"Very strong, sturdy and cuts great.  Cuts much better than the one I got at a local store."
5.0,"Fiskars makes a reliable pruning shears for gardeners. It's pretty basic, but I bought it for a black Friday special and paid little to nothing for it. It is well worth it at full price. It will snip a branch up to 1/2"" thick, but thicker than that, you will need longer handles."
5.0,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE THE PRUNERS WORK GREAT
5.0,These shears allow me to prune my Plum trees with ease.  It really makes clean cuts that are essential in pruning.
5.0,Great Shears.  They work perfectly.
5.0,These are good strong pruning shears. They fit easily in my relatively small hands and weren't hard to use. They have a nice safety latch that is easy to use. They don't seem prone to rust and the grip is comfortable.
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,Works on the tough blackberries I have .
5.0,The BEST pruning shears!  They stay sharp and and easily cut through the stem when pruning bushes.
5.0,"I have only used the LR Nelson Raintrain Travel Sprinkler once, but I was very pleased with its performance. It was easy to assemble, the directions were clear and it lived up to my expectations. It covers a large amount of territory and does a good job of watering as it goes. I may purchase another one for my back yard."
5.0,"I bought this for a rental house I own. And it works great! I have irrigation at my home and really like it but didn't want to spend the $ on a built in system for a rental house,(but I like my properties to look nice) so this Nelson yellow tractor works great. The lawn was so burnt and brown, then after just 3 times with this tractor it needs to be mowed, and the lawn looks good again. It puts the water on perfectly and consistant. It's as good as an irrigation system if not better. (as far as amount of water being applied) The only work involved is placing down the hose and wraping it up, If you call that work? You won't regret buying it if you have a flat lawn.  From the other (negitive) reviews I've read, it sounds like people try to water mud! Up hills in the mountains. I really like it and you will too. Get ready to mow! And one other thing! Keep your eyes on it because some low life will steal it! It's too bad, but very true."
5.0,"The Raintrain sprinkler can be purchased with confidence.  It works as advertised.  I've got a 17,000 sq ft yard which someday will be a good candidate for an inground sprinkler system.  But until that day, the Traveling Sprinkler is a good workaround.  I was always having to go back outside every hour or so to move the oscillating sprinkler, now the little yellow tractor does the job by itself.  I still use an oscillating sprinkler for back corners and small spots, while letting the Tractor Sprinkler handle the big open areas.

I use and recommend 5/8"" hose.  You're going to be running a hundred, maybe 200 feet of hose when you use this sprinkler, so water pressure loss will be a factor with 1/2"" hose.

With experience you will learn the best courses to run this sprinkler in your yard.  As you know, you lay down the hose in the course you want the sprinkler to take, and the front grooved wheel rides on the hose and guides the sprinkler along.  The manual says make your hose turns very wide and gradual, and this is important.  The tractor will have trouble following sharp hose turns if they have a radius less than about 3 feet.

Another thing to remember is that the tractor sprinkler drags the hose behind it as it moves along.  Early in the course, there will be just a small loop, but as the course runs along, the dragged hose loop gets longer and heavier.  This can give the tractor a problem handling turns late in the hose's course -- at this point the mass of the water filled hose being dragged behind, can overcome the steering authority of the nose wheel, making the tractor jump off course.

This may not be a problem for smaller yards if you're not running more than 50 feet or so of hose.  At 200 feet of hose, it's an issue.  To avoid this, either keep the programmed run fairly straight... or put the biggest turns in the course early on in the run, where there won't be so much heavy hose being dragged behind.  Or you could take a tip from the big tractor guys and add a little more weight to the nose, which would keep the wheel pressed down better on the hose.  I haven't yet tried this myself, as the little tractor is already pretty at about 25 pounds.

Where you want the tractor sprinkler to stop, place that little yellow plastic stop bumper over the hose at that point.  The Tractor nose wheel runs over it, then the top of the stop bumper hits a kill switch on the belly of the tractor, and she halts.  This is a great feature which lets you start the thing and then go out for a while, or even go to bed for the night... and the tractor will be stopped there waiting for you when you get back.

You can fine tune the spray pattern from the rotor head.  Point the spray heads up for high spray, or level for spray directed more horizontally.  I like the horizontal pattern -- here in TX we get some wiiinnnndy days, and with this low horizontal pattern, the sprinkler shoots the water efficiently onto the yard without throwing a lot of it up into the wind where it gets lost to evaporation.

Vary the hose pressure and you can go from a coverage width of about 15 feet up to nearly 50 feet.  There are two drive speed settings.  I've always used the slow setting. This tractor lays down a LOT of water into the ground at the slow speed. If you've had trouble keeping your turf sufficiently hydrated, this is the answer.

This Tractor Sprinkler is meant for established lawns.  Newly seeded turf can be chewed up too much by the lugged drive wheels, and the dragged hose.  Nelson recommends an oscillating sprinkler for newly seeded lawns.

Can't think of much else to say about it just now.  If I do, I'll come back and edit :).  Bottom line, I give it a good recommend.  Any questions, email me at KINGLEO1@AOL.COM."
5.0,I've owned this sprinkler for 5 or 6 years now and it still works like when I first got it.  It stays outside all summer long and I have done no maintenace on it at all.  I got tired of buying cheapie plastic sprinklers every year only to have them quit working half way through the summer.  Although the initial purchase price is high it is cheaper in the long run.  I like it so much I am going to buy another one.
4.0,"This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment.  I've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed.  The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard, the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck.  You certainly can't just set it and forget it.  It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving."
5.0,We bought 2 of these tractors last year to help water our 75 trees we have.  We water over 100 feet at a time.  We have a total of 500 feet of trees.  Before we found these tractors we had 20 trees die on us since then we've had now die.  Now we can set them and just let them go. These tractors are the best thing.
3.0,"I like mine OK, as other reviewers have noted, it can be tricky to keep it from jumping the track - I have to keep ""half an eye"" on it. I've had mine for 3 years, and am on my third transmission - mainly due to it getting stuck somewhere and stripping the internal plastic gears. I do feel that a properly designed geartrain wouldn't break, it would just stop turning.

Nelson sells new transmissions on their website for about $15, so its isn't a big expense, just a hassle as their mail order delivery is a throwback to the 1950s - SIX weeks! No-one seems to sell them locally or online...

You have to remove the wheels from the old transmission which is a bit of a hassle but doable. Installation of the new tranny is straightforward.

Still, even with its downsides, it sure beats moving sprinklers around - at least until I get around to installing an automatic sprinkler system."
5.0,I would recommend this product to everyone who has a lawn in need of water. What a great system for watering your lawn.
5.0,"Raintrain water sprinkler works great. But when I tilled a graden area, iot kept getting stuck in it's own mud created. I submitted pictures with the LR Nelson raintrain traveling sprinkler ad. I made a set of half tracks for it and it works perfect. It goes anywhere I put the steering hose, and doesn't bog down at all."
5.0,We were so tired of moving the sprinkler several times during the day to do a complete watering.  It was such a hassle.  We bought the Raintrain with a Christmas gift certificate because we thought we would give it a try.  What a difference!  We just set it up and let it go and turn it off when it is finished.  I am sure we do a better watering job with this product than when we were manually moving the sprinkler all day.  We love it so much that we are seriously considering getting a second one just for the back yard.
5.0,Better than the plastic one I had by far.
5.0,easy to operate. loving it !
5.0,These last so much better than the plastic ones.
4.0,"Not much to say, it's a hose nozzle.

You squeeze, water comes out. Sturdy and doesn't leak, so I'm happy."
5.0,These sprayers are the best.
5.0,Works perfect with no leakage!
5.0,"I've tried fancier, higher priced nozzles and determined that it's a waste of money.  You can't beat this classic design, especially given the price."
3.0,These work well for awhile (6-12 months) and then become sticky to the point where the handle doesn't release.  Be prepared to change them periodically.
5.0,works as advertise.
5.0,"great value, works great"
5.0,"This sprinkler is absolutely great!  I have a large backyard and usually have to move the oscillating sprinkler 5 to 6 times to get the entire backyard.  With the traveling sprinkler I can water the whole backyard at once and don't even have to worry about remembering to shut it off, as it has a device which stops it automatically.

I have had a few issues with the sprinkler going off-track, but that was because of the way I set it up. Once I got used to what it can and can't do I haven't had any problems."
4.0,This works as I expected it would. Yes there are plastic parts and if you don't use with care you can break it. But I have seen people break the strongest things because they do not know how to care for them. This covers my 80 foot long path without any trouble and water coverage is very good even on low. I do wish I still had the one we had 50 years ago.
5.0,This device enables me to get the whole lawn watered without having to replace the sprinkler a bunch of times.
4.0,"When the product arrived, it was broken. One of the lugs on the wheel was broken.  I had to contact the manufacturer for new lugs - - It took a week and half before I received them.  I wasn't real thrilled about that."
5.0,"We were pleased with our recent sprinkler purchase.  The price was good, the delivery was prompt.  The sprinkler arrived in new condition.  I purchase these units from time to time and will use this vedor again.  Many Thanks, Bill & Liz Josephson"
5.0,This is a great sprinkler. It is durable and adjustable so you determine how wide the sprinkle path is. It also turns its self off at the end of the hose-no more wasted water. I would buy this sprinkler again in a heart beat.
4.0,"This is my 2nd purchase of a Traveling Sprinkler. The first one broke by dropping it.  I can tell you that the most affordable rate for this is somewhere around $70.00. I see that other websites sell them for much more, up to $130.00. This tractor is a great investment, just make sure you purchase a good garden hose, set it on low and use the stop ramp."
5.0,"I don't know if this sprinkler is truly deserving of 5 stars, but it saved me a bundle and I am very grateful. First, a complaint: Nowhere in the product description nor on the box does it state that this should not be used on newly seeded lawns, which is exactly what I needed it for. That said, I had just spent over $250.00 on seed and a tiller rental to remove the old grass in the  back yard of the new house we moved into 5 days prior. The hard clay yard took 8 hours in 102 degree heat to prepare. When it came time to water, I discovered that our water pressure was on the low side and my sprinker which was normally capable of covering the 50 x 70 yard would now have to be relocated 3 times. After the first watering, it broke. I replaced it with one of those series systems which was worthless. I took a chance on the train after reading reviews. The reason it is not reccomended for newly seeded lawns is that the drive wheels can sink into soggy mud (but established grass supports them just fine) until the auto off valve located under the train is triggered when it comes in contact with the ground causing everthing to stop. After some adjusting of the hose to keep it on the slightly higher sections of the clay, the unit was able to complete the course I set for it, thoroughly watering every square foot of the yard. The seeds are now just begining to sprout. This unit seems very well made, is easy to adjust the spray pattern, can travel along up to 200' of hose (which when combined with the infinite spray patterns and 2-speed transmission should accomodate almost any yard configuration) and as a bonus, the kids and even some adults like to watch it do its thing. A little pricey but worth it."
5.0,"Great sprinkler.  Just set it up and forget it.  Delivered prmptly and as promised.  Good communication.

Additional Comment from Buyer:
It's now 2016, and I am still using this sprinkler to water my lawn weekly!  There are areas that it doesn't reach (corners, side yard) and as a result, I've purchased several other sprinklers to guarantee full water coverage on my lawn.  Those units have all failed after one or two seasons, where this sprinkler continues to work, year after year.  Great quality!"
5.0,"We love our Raintrain.  It is very sturdy and I'm sure will last for years.  We have a large yard, so we don't even put it on a ""track"".  We just turn it on and let it go.  No more moving sprinklers!!!"
4.0,work well and last for many seasons
5.0,These are very high quality pruners!
5.0,"Thank you so much, perfect description, beautiful!"
5.0,Great product!
4.0,"Nice pair of pruning shears, but they are so big I gave them to my son, my hand won't close over them comfortably."
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"Receivced OK, Thank You."
4.0,You get what you pay for. They aren't the best and they aren't the worst.
5.0,Love Fiskar products.  Always good quality.
5.0,just what I expected.  Nice quality.
3.0,"I bought the raintrain because I have an 8000 sq.ft. lawn, and my two faucets - which previously were connecting to two sprinklers - were inadequately watering the lawn.  This year, my region is going through an extensive drought.  Mix that with my efforts of re-establishing a very poorly established lawn, and you have a lot of reason to buy something effective.

The unit is massive.  It's roughly two feet long, and weighs a bunch.  That caught me by surprise because the pictures make it look much smaller.

Assembly happened in less than a minute.  I read over the instructions, and it had a blatant warning about using only on established lawns.  What could it do, I thought.  My lawn was 98% established, and although it was patchy in places and thin, it should be good enough.  Eeehh, incorrect answer.

After the third attempt - with different hose lengths and trail patterns - the sprinkler managed to lodge itself into mud every time without fail.  The latest attempt, the unit made the 75 ft. crawl to the ramp, but dug into the grass at the ramp (instead of propelling over it to plug the shutoff valve).  Flooding for the front yard because I left it to its own devices for a few hours to go to work.

Due to this unreliability, you can not take your eye off of this thing.  You should not run it over 75 feet, although it's advertised to run up to 200 ft, all that weight behind it will just plow it into the earth.  I advise literally checking this thing every half hour or so to make sure it's still on track and progressing.

""Slow"" setting is extraordinarily slow.  I want to saturate the ground 1"" per week for a decent run, and it takes between 8-10 hours to do so on my large lawn.  The conclusions, of course, were flooding (after it dug into mud) because I initially thought it would be okay to set it and leave it.  By the time I got around to it the following morning, part of my lawn was marshland.

It's been a tough product after about a month and an interesting eye candy for passers-by in the neighborhood.  I would only recommend this for people who would run it on a weekend day and have the convenience of being at home for extended periods of time to monitor it.

Do not buy this hoping for a ""set and leave"" device."
5.0,I have had this for about a month now and love the product. It makes watering the yard much more enjoyable. I would reccomend this for anyone not wanting to spend a lot of time moving hoses in the yard.
4.0,"I bought this when we re-seeded the lawn and I didn't have time to go move the sprinkler since I had my son less than a week earlier.
The ""tractor"" as my 3 year old calls it has been a life saver. Our lawn looks great thanks to the 3 water settings!

Like others have said, it takes a bit to get the hose set up correctly and we had multiple times where the wheels got stuck in the mud and dug some holes, but overall, I am very happy with this product."
4.0,"Works as described, it will jump off the hose if in a turn and dragging a lot of hose.
It should have a slower setting for deaper watering."
4.0,I bought this for my husband and it works very well.  It has been used quite a few times and he is pretty happy with the prinkler.
4.0,"This is very well built and works as advertised.  Turns out not to be ideal for my place, for a few reasons that might be of interest to other buyers.

First, it moves along too slowly, even at high speed.  Takes over six hours to creep through something under 200' feet of hose.  Maybe it takes a fairly ""deep-watering ""approach, which could be fine for many, but here the soil is sandy and drains quickly, so it's a waste of water.  People around here have auto sprinklers going a bit each day.  I'd be watering 10 hours a day to cover my lot!

Second, my lot is one side of the opening quandrant of a cul-de-sac, which matters, because there are lots of irregular shapes to water.  This sprinkler is only a set-it-and-forget-it thing if your whole area needs the same width of spray.

Still, the product seems great, but it hasn't been a silver bullet for my situation.

Also, I got it from Amazon because I automatically assume they have the best price.  Then next day I chanced by one at Menards for $10 less!"
5.0,"Very pleased with sprinkler. To me, it's the next best thing to underground sprinkler system."
3.0,"I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.

Pros:
>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, ""sprinkler watching"" seems to be a common phenomenon.

>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.

>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.

>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.

>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).

>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.

Cons:
>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.

>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.

>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.

>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.

>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.

>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.

>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on ""low gear,"" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.

>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the ""nose"" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.

>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain ""jump the track.""  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.

>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.

Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs."
4.0,"This sprinkler is everything it is cracked up to be, and more.  I've had no problems with it at all.  Works great."
4.0,"The wheels tend to get bogged down in wet dirt, so if your lawn isn't established, this might not be the sprinkler for you, but other than that, it works as advertised."
3.0,Harsh spray not conducive for gardening. Good utility sprayer. You will wear out hand muscles trying to get a reduced spray. Filling buckets is messy.
5.0,"Best one out there for the price.  Simple and works well.  Made in red China, but still worth it."
4.0,It's a nice basic nozzle. A plastic one separated and I hope this is more durable. They are very useful.
5.0,"So I originally made the mistake of buying some new, fancy, 'high-quality' spray nozzle from Amazon before promptly returning it and getting this one. While the other nozzle was solidly built, the stream was tiny and the control over the water pressure was lacking. This nozzle is able to put out a fine mist to a solid, powerful stream with total control. These qualities are what make this tried and tested classic the reigning champion of spray nozzles, IMHO.

The simple metal construction means there are fewer parts to break, and when it eventually does, it is cheaply replaced. The metal trigger lever is a big plus -- most of the similar plastic wrapped nozzles also have plastic levers, which I've learned have a tendency to snap or crack up at the top where they pull on the little gold nut. I expect this one to last much longer because of this.

The threaded front is also a big plus. These days, all sorts of convenient yard and garden products come in packaging meant to be screwed onto a garden hose to be sprayed. This means I don't have to run to the basement, close the water supply, and replace the nozzle twice, each time I want to use such a product, and it gives me more control over the application, since such containers usually have more rudimentary on/off valves.

The only downside, perhaps, to this nozzle is the grip is hard metal and a bit narrow, so it isn't more comfortable than a rubber or plastic wrapped grip, but to be honest, it doesn't really make a significant difference to me. I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"This is perfect for all my hosing needs....lol...seriously it does everything I need it to do, from a fine spray to full water flow."
3.0,Pretty good.
4.0,"Provides a strong, concentrated stream, a fine mist and anything in-between that I need. It's light and seemingly durable. I use it daily and have experienced one slight problem: the water doesn't stop immediately when releasing the handle now. Instead, the trigger retracts in about 1-2 seconds after releasing. It's attached to an indoor hose, so I got lots of stuff wet before I developed the habit to keep it pointed downward until the water stream stops."
5.0,durable pistol grip that allows me to still wash car and save water in California!!
5.0,"Solid, drip-proof.  Like what we remember our grandparents using."
5.0,It sprays water and doesn't leak.
5.0,Best brand out there.
5.0,I bought these to get rid of some blackberries that were taking over. They worked perfectly! Comfy to hold and wonderfully sharp. Cheaper on Amazon than at the local hardware store.
5.0,"sharp, easy to use, affordable, would buy again."
1.0,piece of junk. don't trust these positive reviews like me.
5.0,Great product. Product as advertised.
4.0,used them nice
2.0,cuts great but the coat on the  blade was scratched and came off after couple of uses. I can see a rust sign almost after a month . Not sure how long this will last. Somewhat disappointed
5.0,good tool
3.0,These look and feel nice but didn't cut as cleanly as I expected. They were used on hydrangeas and roses. I wound up using a cheap $4 pair I bought at ross instead.
5.0,came within time frame and product is same as description
4.0,"This tractor is one hard worker...occasionally it gets off the track or digs down into the grass and gets stuck in the mud it creates. I have found I need to watch it a little more carefully then I thought. But, it covers a lot of ground and for the most part is dependable.
I`d buy again....."
5.0,"High quality product.  Have only had the Raintrain for a few months, but it has worked really well.  Makes watering much easier.  The sprinkler did go off the hose track once, likely do to a sharp turn in the hose."
5.0,I have used it several times and it works well.  I have been using it on the fastest setting and it still moves pretty slow.  Real good coverage for a large yard.
5.0,I have one of these that is about 25 years old.  When I need a part I just call the company and they mail it to me -- free of charge.  I just bought a new one for the front yard and now I have one for both yards.  They are very efficient and there is less evaporation than with any of the other sprinklers I have.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
5.0,"I purchased this sprinkler a few weeks ago after getting tired of moving my previous sprinkler around my yard.  My lot is 1/3 acre and it was very time consuming to water it effectively.  This product works great and is extremely efficient and easy to use.  I have some gradual hills in my backyard and this product has no problem going up or coming down them even while pulling the hose behind it.  Even my wife, who was not thrilled that I spent this much on a sprinkler, loves it.  Worth every penny."
4.0,This really is a set it and forget it device.  Just make sure the hose is laid out flat with no sharp turns and the little engine that could will.  I am able to water entire sections of my lawn without having to move the hose.
5.0,"Great sprinkler.  I have even gotten the attention of the neighbors.  Nice, heavy metal.  Great coverage.  Works exactly as promised.  Could not find this quality sprinkler in the home stores near me."
5.0,This sprinkler covers a lot of ground without having to go out and move it every few minutes.
4.0,This system works well and saves much time while watering my yard.
4.0,"We have a big yard in the south that needs water, we also have two little kids and didn't want to waste lots of time moving sprinklers around. What would be better than something like this?!?!

We read the great reviews here we decided to purchase the raintrain. I was a bit scared about the comments of it jumping the hose and running all over the place. I understand why, it's not 100% reliable at staying on course or shut off when expected to. It's only jumped off the hose (3/8 heavy duty industrial hose) once since we've owned it. But, it has had a tougher time stopping. Sometimes the ramp doesn't shut it off and it continues on its way. One time it even hit the sidewalk edge where it got stuck and ground the wheels down a bit. I've tried as best I can to follow the directions straight path before/after ramp, but it's not 100% reliable. I haven't yet encountered the problem with sharp turns, but maybe that's because I've been warned and avoid doing that. Big yard, lots of space not a problem for me.

If you've got the time for infrequent checks it's great.

Other than those issues I'd given it 5 stars. Very cool, pretty reliable and the kids love to check on it... the family loves it.

Now if they only made one with a 10' coverage area I'd have two!"
5.0,"Fast delivery, very strong water stream."
2.0,I got thos nozzle at the end of last summer. Worked great like everyone said.  I live up north and we have pretty cold weather in the winter. I dried and stored the nozzle in the garage. I brought ir out this summer as soon as water flowed water shot out with all the water pressure behind it. There was a major crack on the base bevel so I couldn't use it at all. I only got 3 to 4 uses out of it. Not a durable product.
1.0,"Cracked after 3 weeks of use.  It seemed to crack for no reason, it wasn't dropped or crushed, I just went to use it one day and a split grew down the handle as I used it."
5.0,Works great.  I love it...
5.0,Good quality for a good price.
5.0,don't but the plastic multi spray ones - they will strip and leak at the hose connection - this works fine and is cheap
5.0,great nozzle
5.0,Excellent nozzle that will most likely withstand the test of time!
5.0,"This does fail after years of use, but still best option."
1.0,Not happy with my purchase. Plastic not metal like picture shown.
2.0,"Might be that I received a bad sample, but the top blade is skewed, and rubs heavily when opening and closing the shears. The blade itself is dull. Cutting only works if you use mid-section - blades don't close well enough to cut off anything with the tips. Can you get the job done? Yes, but I was expecting much more from Fiskars."
5.0,Nice product
5.0,"Great product, sharp and easy to use.  Ron"
5.0,"This is a good pair of shears at a great price.  They are incredibly sharp and cut through even thick branches with ease.
The grip is comfortable enough, though I only use them occasionally so I can't say how they feel after extended use.
This is a quality, well-made pair of shears from one of the best companies in the business, and that is 100% unsolicited.
I've used a lot of different shears from Fiskars, and I highly recommend them for both quality and value."
1.0,"I bought these because they were the #1 seller of pruning shears and I thought the ""Fiskers"" brand was good. I am very disappointed. I've already used them enough (a week) that it isn't worth returning them. The ""offset"" between the two blades was to much from the factory causing the blades to get stuck when gripped together. The spring is to weak to open them (and yes I cleaned and oiled them). Even after taking them apart, stretching out the spring and trying to decrease the offset between the blades- they are unusable. I have to open them manually with my pinky finger after every cut. Very frustrating!
At least they were low priced. Because of that, I will eat my loss and buy a more expensive/better quality pair."
5.0,A FINE HELPFUL GARDEN TOOL. A+
2.0,"Ok for very small jobs but when you tackle anything more than 1/4"" the blade alignment becomes skewed. I would not buy again"
5.0,"Good price, Excellent product. Very robust and sturdy. I am happy wit my purchase!!"
3.0,"Not as sturdy as I had expected. In less than a month it lost its edge/sharpness, and it gets stuck."
5.0,Cut little bushes with them and it does easily does the job.
4.0,Works much better than I thought it would.  Seams to be well made and except for going off its track once and a while it works great.
5.0,"What I like best about it is that the water comes out in big droplets that all reach the ground, not a fine spray that is blown away by the wind."
5.0,"I live on just over a half acre and hated dragging my hose and sprinklers around the yard, it was an all day deal. I love the Raintrain, you set up the hose and let it run. I don't have to go out and change the sprinklers every 10 minutes, and with the auto shut off I can leave the house and not worry about getting back in time to shut off the hose.. This is a great product and I am thinking about getting another one..."
5.0,"This sprinkler is amazing.  I can set it up and if I forget about it, it just shuts itself off.  I love it!"
4.0,"This unit works great as a sprinkler, but at the end of the cycle it won't shut off. When it comes to the end of the cycle where I set the plastic shut-off hump, it only shuts off part way. The shut-off valve is defective. The tractor comes to the shut-off hump and sits on top of it digging holes in the lawn with its rear wheels. I've tried to close the shut-off valve by hand, but it doesn't work, so I just have to watch it when it gets close to the end."
5.0,"I can't believe I didn't know this existed before.  Works great, reliable and fun to watch."
5.0,This sprinkler is almost like having an inground system.  Just set it up and come back an hour or two later.  Lawn watered!
5.0,"We purchased the traveling sprinkler for our son, who lives in Iowa. The local shops no longer carry this item. We were told it had been replaced, but upon looking at them, they were of lesser quality. We researched Amazon.com and were able to locte one from you. It is GREAT!  Our son uses it all the time and is so very pleased. Thank goodness for Amazon.com and its vast resources of products."
4.0,"Everyone told me not to buy the RainTrain, that is would never work.  Then I read the reviews online and decided to try it.

Everyone was wrong - it works great!!!  I have been using it for a few months now and it is the closest thing to inground sprinklers you can have, especially for the money.  It beats all the oscillating sprinklers we had set up for our large yard.  I just set out the hose and off it goes.

Although it is definitely the best alternative out there I did notice some minor issues while experimenting with it.  The longer the hose, the slower it goes, and the more chance it has of going off track, and stopping all together.  Also, especially if you use a long length, you need to use a strong hose.  The cheaper, thinner gauge hoses, tangle as the train moves and stops the water.

I haven't tried inclines yet, and don't plan to.  I have tried turns and haven't been successful yet.  Any change in direction needs to happen gradually over a long distance.

But, all this said, it is GREAT, and I tell everyone I know to buy it.  It saves me a lot of time, and it very easy to use."
5.0,"It is so nice to be able to water my entire backyard overnight.

It takes a bit of practice to get the hose set up right, but once you have it, it works really well."
5.0,"Cheap and gets the job done! This small pistol grip nozzle creates a strong concentrated stream of water that is powerful enough to spray debris off my patio, wash patio furniture, and easily adjust so you can spray your lawn or water your plants. Great value!"
5.0,Best nozzle we've found
5.0,"Nice solid and sturdy product.  It does what it's suppose to, and it doesn't leak like the plastic one I had if you accidentally drop it on a hard surface.  I bought another one for my other hose.  I definitely recommend."
5.0,Very solid water hose nozzle. I have had it over a year and it still functions just like the day I got it. I am very hard on it. When I put the hose down I just drop it on the driveway beating it and banging it around and it still works great.
5.0,Best ever
4.0,well made in china?
5.0,Good old fashioned hose nozzle.
5.0,"Feel lucky to find these all die cast metal Gilmour hose nozzles on Amazon, I am not sure if they are still made as they aren't in any retail big box stores or in local hardware stores, work terrific, so I bought (3) so I have a few extras, this is absolutely positively the best heavy duty hose nozzle PERIOD that keeps on working and has a brass knurled nut to adjust continuous spray just like you remembers from years of Yore! 5 stars"
5.0,I use this for washing my car and really like the way the spray pattern changes with the pressure applied to the handle.  No need to use your other hand to make adjustments.
4.0,"As many has pointed out, the product is not exactly as shown the picture. It is NOT shinny. It feels like a special type of plastic. the only Zinc in it is probably the yellow parts you see in the picture. However, I love it. It is cheap, and does the job. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a restraint to keep the flow constant. Otherwise, it DOES the job."
4.0,"I love this little tractor. Once I bought a long, actually very long, hose I can lay the hose round my lawn and let tractor go, then the tractor will follow the hose around the lawn by itself. I can put it in action then do my thing, and come back in a couple of hours or longer (depending on the speed you set).

The only thing I think it can be improved is the speed. Even I set it the fastest, it still goes kind of slow. I know the designer of the sprinkler wants to make sure the sprinkler waters the lawn thoroughly but I wish that it could go a bit faster. Sometimes I don't want to soak the lawn that much."
3.0,"This would be a 5-star item except that Nelson apparently likes to make money by selling replacement gear boxes. The gears are made of cheap plastic that won't even last one season, for me. I've examined the broken gear boxes; the broken gear is always the same one. Seems like Nelson could greatly improve the reliability of the unit without significantly affecting the cost if one or two of the plastic gears were replaced with brass or stainless-steel."
5.0,"Every year my family goes threw at least 3 full sized sprinklers. Watering 5 acres can be a challenge, but this traveling sprinkler does the job. All you have to do is set your path, adjust the arms for water travel length , place automatic shut-off ramp and let it roll.

I've used 100 ft. of hose and never had any pressure problems with this sprinkler. Most of the larger sprinklers will loose their stride at this length , but the Raintrain put all of my worries to rest.

Quality product."
5.0,I love my tractor.  It does not move because of a bad gear.  I can't find parts.  This is distressing.
1.0,"i'd have given it 0 stars if i could.  the gears are made out of plastic, and are prone to stripping if the tractor is not used in optimal conditions.  i broke mine 3 times (returned each time) when it would get stuck in the mud, against a small rock or something similar.  when used in optimal conditions, this item works, but i'd recommend getting a rittenhouse instead"
3.0,"It works well (great watering area), I have had trouble making it go up an incline though."
4.0,"Positives: Good sprinkler - can adjust spray from small area to a large area - the two speeds are nice depending how much watering you wish to do - pulls well at the end of the hose or end of the run - strong gearbox

Negatives: seems to be alittle top heavy - can't put sprinkler on too much of a slope or it will turn over - water shut off button underneath the sprinkler sometimes shuts sprinkler off or nearly off on uneven ground - we have a new yard which has not settled completely - it is uneven in places - sometime the sprinkler can hit a high spot and either turn sprinkler off or almost off - I temporarily remedied the problem with a removable piece of short garden hose approximately 1/2"" long slit along the side so to wrap around the stem of shut off button to prevent it from shutting off knowing that this is bypassing the automatic shut of feature"
5.0,"I used to see a simular type of traveling sprinkler as a young boy in Orlando, Fl.  I went on line and found the Nelson.  I just received it today and put it to work, Excellent,,so much that I have just ordered another one.  I will not need to put a sprinkling system in my lawn now. This is so much more cost effective and it is not a problem of laying out the hoses.  All I want to say is,,,if you do not have an in ground system, buy the Nelson, it will do a perfect job of watering your lawn. It is built heavy to last a long time.  Ervin Joslin"
5.0,This product works very well. You have to be careful how you lay out the hose. If the angles are too extreme the sprinkler will go off the hose track. A periodic check when it is in use is helpful until you master the hose layout.
5.0,"What a wonderful little machine! No more dragging hoses around the yard and no more running out to move the sprinkler.  The little tractor is a work horse.  The tractor works very well on relatively flat areas, but not good for hills.  Two of my neighbors are purchasing one for their yards.  It is also a great ""toy"" for big boys!"
5.0,Sharp and clean cuts. Love it!
5.0,Pruning is made easy with this pair of sharp shears.
5.0,"This product is really interesting because it gives me the satisfaction I need whenever I fix my garden. The size is good enough so I can bring it anywhere. I'm also amazed with its blades because no matter how much I use it, it's still sharp like the first time bought it. It's a must have for garden lovers like me!"
5.0,"I'm a very small gal, & don't have a very strong grip, but these cutters do the trick for me for cleaning up the trees trunks/bushes around the house."
1.0,Broke the first time I used it!
5.0,Practical pruner
5.0,Sharp!
5.0,These are my favorite shares initially bought them at a retail store but I was happy to find them online
5.0,Good quality product.  Exactly as pictured and described.  Would not hesitate to recommend.
5.0,good quality
3.0,Good quality but more expensive than target. And not good for a small garden for the water spraying in a huge circle.
5.0,This old original design has not been improved on.  Don't waste time and money on any other nozzle.  This is the one to have.
5.0,"Simple and therefore reliable. With basic care probably going to last years and years.

FWIW everybody drops their hoses too hard all the time and this makes them break sooner. Just put it down easier."
5.0,"Great protect, no rust, I keep it on my boat and use in salt water"
5.0,"Bought one for the back yard, now buying one for the front yard. Simple, effective, and most important - durable. Those crappy plastic nozzles don't last more than a year through tough Minnesota winters. Great value buy."
3.0,"Good for long distance, bad for delicate items. You can't really control the pressure. I have it exposed to the elements and it has lasted longer than those plastics one."
5.0,Works great second one.
5.0,great item not plastic
5.0,Works well & it's nice to find one still made of metal.
5.0,Good standard sprayer
5.0,"I have not used my LR Nelson traveling sprikler to date, as sufficient rain has been falling. I have had good reports from my son who ordered one and prompted me to do the same.  One of my previous neighbors had one and I was impressed by its performance."
4.0,Well made quality product. Appears to be constructed to last many years. Saves me a LOT of sprinkler changes!
5.0,short of an inground sprinkler this is what you need for that good ole one inch of water a week.
3.0,"I've owned mine for a week, and it worked great out of the box.  I hooked up 5/8"" x 150 ft hose to it, and as stated, travelled the length of the hose and stopped as expected at the stop ramp (which pushes a button (plug) to stop the water.  The second time i used it, i laid out more of an S pattern which ultimately caused the dragging hose to get caught on a rock accidently, and caused the tractor to jump off the tracks and beeline into an immoveable object (short bush).  the tractor didn't know it wasn't moving (ie. no clutch), and the wheels dug a bit into the ground, and ultimately the cheap plastic gears got stripped ([...]), and the tractor was not able to pull more than the weight half the hose (~75ft).  fortunately I was able to return for a replacement (though the directions specifically state the forward motion of the sprinkler should not be impeded while the armatures are spinning - but accidents do happen!).  I suspect the other negative reviews listed here had similar problems (ie. tractor not able to move, while the armatures still spun - ie. hose getting snagged, or tractor being impeded), which ultimately led to gears being stripped.  you can buy replacement gear set for ~13, but who wants to do that?  I think to make this a better product, the gears should have been metal (ie. strong enough to prevent the armatures from spinning, when the tractor itself has stopped), but I suspect that leads to other problems (ie. rusting), but more likely it's done this way because it's cheap.  i still like it though, so i'm not returning it.. but down the line (ie. someone mentioned after a year or so), I'll just buy the replacement gear set to fix it."
5.0,I have been using the Nelson traveling sprinklers for over 20 years and am completely satisfied.  I have purchased repair parts for our old one and it is still working as if it was new. A competitor went out of business and left us with an unrepairable unit.
5.0,I am very happy I made this purchase--this was well worth the amount I spent. The fact that this travels all over the yard makes watering much easier! No more having to go outside and move the sprinkler every 15-20 minutes!
4.0,"I have used my Nelson for 2 seasons now and it has been a great helper around the yard. I love being able to set it up and forget about it. It has been very dependable and keeps our yard looking great. I really did not want to trench up my lot to install a sprinkling system- and this tractor has made that possible. I would have given it 5 stars but the ""off-ramp"" is made of a plastic that became brittle and broke after only 1 year of service.

If you need an easy way to water a 1/3 to 1 acre lot, this is it! Enjoy."
2.0,"I own three LR Nelson Traveling Sprinklers! Two speed and a neutral positions. Says that it drags 200' foot of hose!

  The traveling sprinkler is a great concept. However, ""They just don't make 'em like the used to.""

 The gear box has failed in all three within a seasons time. Just be prepared to buy a new one every 2 months and 'Happy Watering!'"
1.0,"I have had this sprinkler for 2 years or so. I find it agravating as heck. I cannot leave if it is on. The ground needs to be flat and hard for it to traverse, or it will sink in soft, or muddy dirt, or just get stuck. The sprinkling effect only covers the outer radius of a circle, rather than the whole area of said circle. I am looking for a better unit. 1-star is the lowest they had to choose from."
5.0,"I moved into a new house recently, with a big yard that's half sod and half recently-seeded dirt.  Like a previous reviewer, I've been spending most of my free time moving sprinklers around.
This travelling sprinkler was a gift from my father-in-law.  It looked like a novelty product that the kids would play with, but it's become one of the most useful lawn care devices I've ever owned.
I set mine up as soon as I get home from work and let it spend a few hours watering the sod while I have dinner with my family, take the kids to their sporting events, etc.  It does a great job and gives excellent coverage, with very little effort from me.
One note:  as it says in the fine print on the side of the box, don't use this on a recently seeded patch of soil.  I tried that before I saw the warning and the tractor got stuck in the mud and dug a trench across the back yard.  My fault completely, but watch out that you don't repeat my mistake!"
5.0,"These are great quality shears. I was able to get a 2"" thick piece of wood with these. Took a few tries but it did it! It has very sharp blades as well and cuts a clean edge on whatever you need clipping so no damage to the plant. Easy to use, lightweight and a built in lock at the top."
5.0,Great pair of pruners. Awesome for the $
5.0,"Of all the brands of pruning sheers we use, Fiskars have been our favorite, won't buy anything other than these."
2.0,I have used Fiskars for many years so I ordered this pair expecting the same good product. I am using these which do not fit in my hand as well and the do not cut through while pruning roses or any other plants.  Very disappointed.
5.0,I just love it cuts great
4.0,"well built, they do the job"
5.0,So pleased.  These shears are sharp and strong and perfect for the jobs I am doing.
5.0,nice and sharp
5.0,Great shears.
5.0,Well made and a great buy!!
5.0,I've always liked this sprayer and was disappointed when our local stores stopped carrying it.  Gilmour makes a cheaper version of this.. without the threading... don't buy that one.  That one is lousy.  This one works great and lasts a lot longer.
5.0,Very good quality!
3.0,"Its okay, Not the clearest instructions. I could not figure out how to adjust and lock the nozzle. But it did what  i needed it to do.

It does have adjustable spray pressure. Rain , Mist, Spray

It is heavy duty, made out of strong materials"
4.0,"Wish the pressure was a bit higher. Well build, seems like it will last. Tried to clean outside windows on the second floor did not have as much pressure as I thought it would."
5.0,"I live with my elderly mother and she insisted we had to get the same one as the metal one she got 30 years ago!  I couldn't find the metal one anymore---BUT THIS WORKS AS WELL, EVEN MY 88 YEAR-OLD MOTHER LIKES IT.  In fact, she couldn't tell a difference.  I'm assuming it won't last as long, but it works, even more smoothly than the old metal ones we had."
5.0,Bought this so I didn't have to keep reaching plastic handles. Works great!
5.0,Received as promised
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Works perfectly.  Thanks.
4.0,Not made in USA but not much is.  Works okay so far after one use.
4.0,"Good model, but have always preferred the anvil style by Fiskars."
5.0,This has become the basic tool.  Others have been given away.  Thanks!
5.0,Finally a sharp blade !!!
5.0,"Excellent shears, bought two of them"
3.0,"Took a long time to get here, the pruning shears are ok probably should have bought the ratcheting ones."
5.0,very sharp and good grip area
5.0,This is the only tool that I know is best when it comes to pruning.
4.0,Very nice
5.0,Very nice quality
2.0,"The delivery and packaging was right on time, and the product was as promised - a pair of Fiskars pruning shears.  But the utility of the product was another story.  I bought these Fiskars pruning shears and a pair of Fiskars loppers, because the brand is well-known, which I (wrongly) assumed counted for quality.  I mean, how do you get to be well-known if your product doesn't work?  Neither of them were sharp, and the blades of these little pruners ... I'm not sure how to explain this... preferred to spread sideways - path of least resistance - instead of straight through the small bush branches I was trying to prune.  I'm going to try to send both back."
5.0,Good for the money.
2.0,"I have bought two of these now. The first one was great, we've had it over a eyar and I use it once every couple weeks to wash cars. The second one we've had abouta month and it sucks. The lever has a squishy feeling compared to the first one, and it doens't always turn off, spraying a fine mist after you let go of the handle. And if you dorp it on the ground it will start misting and not turn off, so you have to pic it up and play with the elver to get it to turn off. Poor quality control....

It's not worth the $8 or whatever to ship it back to Amazon so I guess we are stuck with it."
5.0,"Nice, good quality hose nozzle.  Well made, great price !"
3.0,It leaked after 4 uses. Very disappointed.
5.0,Works as advertise. Sturdy and seems like it will last a while
5.0,Works great. And feels like it was made well.
5.0,"I bought this as a spare nozzle, but would use it as the primary one. It's like what most people used when I was younger."
4.0,"I wish it was still made in the USA like my old one.  This one works the same and is pretty much indestructible compared to the numerous fancy garden sprayers that eventually crack, leak or don't work anymore."
4.0,"Pretty good nozzle. I also bought a brass one that looks more like a fire hose. I like that one better, but I find I use this one more often because quick on/off handle release, instead of having to twist the nozzle for on/off. This one wastes less water when using it to spray bugs/aphids off my outdoor container plants, which is better for the drought in California."
4.0,"best of it's kind but room for improvement, especially on durability."
5.0,Item as described and expected. Very pleased. Would definitely recommend to any one
5.0,"love
them"
5.0,one fine pairs of shears
4.0,well made
5.0,"used a pair of there for years,  purchased second pair after the slide that locks them closed for storage began to  malfunction.  Sharp blades, soft nonslip coating on handles."
5.0,as expected
4.0,Works for me

Check the carb. model number and make for the right kit. Sometimes a Zama and a Walbro can look the same but have a different kit. Morrison Outdoor Equipment has parts and Brigg valve guide tools and valve guide bushings for Brigg lawnmowers. A CJ8 is a little hotter than a CJ7. A J19LM is a little hotter than a CJ8. LM stands for Lawn mower. A J61 is MUCH hotter."
5.0,Good deal on quality shears.
5.0,Very effective in cutting as intended to cut
5.0,Very good!
5.0,"Basic, well constructed hose nozzle. nothing fancy, no multiple choices for water outlets, just a simple, reliable old timey mechanism that works great."
5.0,"priced great. These don't leak at all. I have 6 of these and they will last a couple years, even using them daily."
5.0,Seems to be pretty durable
5.0,Excellent spray nozzle. It feels very sturdy and well built. It puts out good pressure. Does a much better job than the fancy fireman hose spray nozzle I bought at a convention.
5.0,It works just fine.
4.0,"Item arrived on time.
Price of the item was 'fair'
Item is very simplistic.  Spray or stream.
Item lacks sensitivity with its spray or stream options which often feel too 'strong'
Solid construction but I prefer the nozzles with more sensitive options...like fine mist
Item is not a bad purchase in general.  It just wasn't a great fit for my needs.
I probably would not buy this item again."
5.0,"Works great. Very sturdy, easy to use."
5.0,Solid feel and simple design.
4.0,"This is your standard, run-of-the-mill hose nozzle, but it works as advertised. The handle force is comfortable."
4.0,Happy with purchase.  I just purchased a new house and I'm learning to do yard work so I thought I'd get good tools.  So I've been getting Fiskars from Amazon and Walmart (Who ever is cheaper).  I like the quality of the brand and my matching set.
4.0,"The sharp blade is already all chipped up from hitting the bypass anvil. Center joint is too loosely designed to keep the angle straight unless there is load on it. What this means is that is works great as long as you get the branch all the way in. If you try to use just the tip to do fine trim work, it will bind up and jam up causing chips in the blade. I've had to file the chips down just to get them to close. Though a high-quality sewing scissor company would make good shears but so far I am less than impressed."
5.0,Excellant
5.0,great
5.0,Sharp and will be using it a lot.
1.0,DO NOT BUY !!!! The coating on these shears started PEALING on the very first attempt to cut a small stem. Seems like a poorly made product. Definitely look for another Brand.
5.0,"I bought this and a 24"" longer one. Both work as advertised. I really enjoy using this tool"
1.0,"Aweful, slide broke The first week."
5.0,Great shears
5.0,No one makes shears like Fiscar. Would not buy any other brand.
5.0,Very sharp so far. Hopefully it will not get rusted like the shear we purchased from homedepot.
5.0,The season is here. Clip away with happiness. Fiskars are the best gardening shears. They stay sharp for tears. These are replacing the ones I had for nearly ten years.
5.0,excellent.
5.0,Very good shears.
5.0,Light weigh easy to use
5.0,"After years of use, these are still sharp and do a great job in my garden.  Fast shipping too!"
5.0,Sharp and affordable.  Not sure what else to say.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,Good quality product.  Works well in the yard.
5.0,I love these! They were great for my project!
5.0,quality built..seems like it will last a long time
5.0,"I haven't had it long, but it's been a nice nozzle so far. It's pretty easy to control the stream. It seems like a tough little pistol so we'll see how it holds up."
5.0,Works great!
1.0,Leaked after a week.
4.0,"I bought this Gilmour hose nozzle to replace one that looked almost like it.  The old one last almost 20 years before it finally sprung a leak, so I had to recycle it.  I'm hoping this Gilmour will last just as long.  So far, it appears sturdy and I'm happy with it.  I've been using it for about a month.  It has a basic ""point-and-shoot"" design.  It is not so easy to adjust the flow to a lighter, ""sprinkle"" setting, but mostly I just need ""on/off"" for my very basic gardening.  There is a magnet attached to the handle, and that comes in handy for sticking the hose nozzle to a fence rail to keep it off the ground."
5.0,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This old design works great. Why do they make plastic nozzles that last a few months?"
5.0,Great nozzle for the price.  Does everything I need at a much cheaper price than many.  Would recommend.
4.0,"Had it for some time now, holding up well. Stop adjuster a lil' flaky sometimes. Still sad it comes from 'somewhere' over seas. Good basic nozzle though."
5.0,"Its the simple things in life. This thing is amazing and just works grrrreat! no cheap plastic to break, just top quality pistol grip nozzle!"
5.0,Works fine
5.0,This locks well and is very well made. It cuts thicker branches than what it looks like it can. The best clippers I've ever used! Handle it excellent!
4.0,Great clippers for the price.
4.0,"Did the job; blades a bit wobbly on thicker stems, just need to be careful."
5.0,Works great very powerful
5.0,Nice and fast
3.0,"Don't expect to cut anything big with these but they work well for trimming rose bushes and other small garden plants.  If you need something heavy duty, these aren't the ones."
5.0,Great Product!
5.0,Excellent Product...
5.0,Great pruners.  Great price too compared to local hardware store
5.0,very sharp. good quality
4.0,"Nothing fancy with a lot of settings.  Just a good quality metal sprayer that delivers a spray ranging from a wide fan to a strong stream, depending on how far you depress the handle.  The strong stream works well for watering plants from a distance, or for washing window screens, which will be the primary use.  The wider spray is good for close-range watering. The only thing it doesn't do, is provide a gentle flow, like if you want to fill the birdbath."
5.0,"This nozzle is perfect for around the campsite. Durable, predictable and easy enough for my 4 year old to use. Seems like it should last..We'll see"
5.0,Old school. Works awesome. Loads of pressure. Love it.
5.0,works great
5.0,"Old school, with old school durability and dependability"
4.0,"A wide range of spray settings, which I love. It's much more convenient than what I had previously (I used my thumb to spray water) but there is still some residual spray escaping from the connection between the spray nozzle and the hose. I added a rubber gasket and that helped, but it still drips or mists when under pressure.

Overall a minor flaw for such an inexpensive product, and I can water the garden and clean the patio with much more precision than without it. Would buy it again."
5.0,great product! finally found one that doesn't leak or break after a month of use-will continue to purchase if I have a need to!
5.0,Good nozzle simple basic but good
5.0,Works great
3.0,It's okay.  It works.  Nothing special.
5.0,very sharp and high quality.
5.0,Great hand pruners!
5.0,good product
5.0,"These shears are wonderful. The best I have ever owned. Sharp, has a built in safety catch to keep them closed. They seem well built and designed."
5.0,"Makes trimming easy, cuts like its going through butter,  pleased with this purchase."
1.0,Poor quality. Cheap feeling and blade is out of alignment after I cut two 3/8 inch branches. Garbage. Buy a more expensive unit.
5.0,"Great set of shears! Super strong, and can get through many thick branches and stems. I have used to clean up my backyard before it started snowing (I only got half way through!). Made trimming plants super easy and fast. Loved these!"
5.0,LOVE-work horse of my garden tools.
1.0,Worked for 5 minutes; then broke.  I  had  a different  brand for 10 years.  Buyer beware!
5.0,this is my 2nd pair and I really like using it for my yard work.
5.0,Can't imagine why you would buy anything else. Forget the plastic things and go with this one.
1.0,The spray nozzle itself is excellent the problem is that I only received 1 not 12.
5.0,I like this nozzle because it doesn't splatter or spay you unsuspectingly like the cheap plastic ones do.
5.0,"As advertised. I wanted a less expensive nozzle I could control with the simple change of pressure in my hand to meet the needs of reseeded grass patches, vegetable garden, delicate seeds, and mature plants. A screw does let you set a certain spray so you don't have to hold the trigger if you do 't want to."
5.0,"Great nozzle, you can tell it is good quality and is meant to last."
5.0,"inexpensive, solid nozzle."
5.0,Works as expected.
5.0,"Delivered on time, and works great so far..."
5.0,"Not sure why they make any other hose nozzle.
This just works, it lasts longer than most of the other options. It also provides more water flow and a harder stream than any other style I have ever tried.
If you need a plastic coated ergonomic insulated nozzle so you don't get your hand cold/hot or whatever.... this is not for you. But if you want a nozzle that will last for years and do a better job than the plastic coated crap out there... this IS for you!"
5.0,cheap and simple works fine
5.0,I love Fiskars products. They never disappoint and are easy to use.
5.0,nice
1.0,I just don't see how pieces of junk made with poor quality parts can get high reviews. TWO of these worthless tools taught me all I need to know about Fiskers LOW  quality items that break and don't stay sharp at all. The better grade one I also bought had the spring break in less than a week too.
5.0,Very sharp shears! Nice weight and grip to them.
5.0,Reliable.  I'm buying more.
4.0,"Great, it cuts as advertised."
1.0,These broke after a couple months of using them would not recommend buying them
5.0,"I was very happy with these pruning shears. I bought them to prune my raspberry and blackberry plants in the winter before the warm weather hits. I also used them to cut back some weed trees that are starting to pop up (not sure what they are actually called, my siblings and I called them ""choke cherry trees"" growing up but I am 99.9% sure that's not their real name). It cut through everything effortlessly and was super easy to use. The locking mechanism worked well. I'm excited for spring to come so I can use them more often and clean up my garden beds!"
5.0,"Great deal, worked as described"
5.0,"Easy to use. Comfortable grip. Cuts great, small or large items."
5.0,This nozzle doesnt leak at all. It can spray in a mist or a focused jet. It has a small triangle you can clip into place and lock it in the on position if you are doing a bunch of watering. It is simple and great!
5.0,"Hey, its  hose nozzle, what else can I say!"
5.0,"Pretty straightforward, it's a simple metal water hose nozzle for a low price. There's nothing fancy about it but it seems durable and has a pressure sensitive water pattern adjustment. You want a straight jet stream, you press all the way down. You want a misty fog pattern you slightly press down. Works for me."
1.0,"Does not look like what is pictured. Doesn't appear to be that shiny ""zinc"" I was expecting, rather some sort of coated metal. Doesn't say Gilmour on it, but does have big ""MADE IN CHINA"" stamped on it. Returning."
3.0,"It works fine, nothing special, only high power settings, to hard for watering plants"
5.0,"this thing looks like a good piece of equipment and when you use it, it actually has a little kick with it"
5.0,Great product.  Arrived quickly.  As advertised.  Thanks!!
5.0,"when you drop it, it doesn't break heavy duty metal"
5.0,Does the job.
5.0,"THESE ARE REALLY GOOD PISTOL GRIP NOZZLES, THEY WORK REALLY WELL. THEY ARE YOUR BASIC NOZZLE WITHOUT
ALL OF THAT FANCY STUFF AND THEY ARE ALL METAL."
5.0,the BEST quality!
5.0,"Have been using it for almost a week; fantastic product.  Perfectly does what I hoped it would do, and so very inexpensive."
3.0,broke after one season leaks around te bolt on back
2.0,Purchased because I was tired of plastic nozzles breaking and this looked sturdy. It's OK from a reliability perspective but a step back in functionality for watering garden. The stream is not as nice as the cheap plastic shower settings and the handle gets extremely cold. I have now upgraded to the gardenite hand sprayer which is a metal version of the cheapo plastic nozzles but has better reliability as it is metal with 10 settings and has insulated handle.
5.0,"Its harder then I expected it to be, to find a plain good old fashioned metal nozzle. I struck gold with this purchase though, it was exactly what I was looking for. No bells and whistles, just a well working nozzle will likely last the duration of my life without so much as a leak.

I would absolutely buy this product again, if I had a need for another."
5.0,"Some times it freezes where I live and sometimes, I forget to turn drain the hose. Thankfully, this inexpensive nozzle doesn't burst and works well for me so I've bought one for every hose around my house."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Works great with the high water pressure we have here in town.
4.0,This nozzle work really good lots of power.
5.0,Sometimes the best tools are the simplest ones.
5.0,Great. Just like the old days.
4.0,"these are fine for pruning plants, and work for what I bought them for."
5.0,"These work great, they are very sharp and do their job well. The safety (the thing that keeps them closed for storage) works much better then other pruning shears I have owned where that was always the first part to fail. So they do stay closed very well, but are still easy to unlock which is something I appreciate in shears. My only possible complaint about them is that the are a little to large for my small female hands, but nothing to be done about that. Overall I am satisfied with these and would recommend them to a friend."
5.0,"very sharp, works well for pruning plants."
5.0,works great
5.0,"Sharp cutting, easy to use."
2.0,"I have bought these clippers in the past and they were great.  This clipper blade is not sharp at all so I am having to continually clip the potted plant branches, which are pretty thin.  I will continue to use them, but I may also rely on my old pair.  I hate that the quality has changed."
5.0,Work great.
5.0,"Great!  Lifetime guarantee
More likely to be permanently borrowed than ever break"
5.0,"Feel good in the hand, cut well, balanced nicely and are Frikars quality."
5.0,"Very good quality product. Then again most of Fiskars products are, that is part of the reason I purchased them, brand recognition. I've cut some fairly large branches and it just slices right through them. Makes trimming my bushes a lot easier, and I prefer to do it by hand then with a hedge trimmer. I've found that if you do them every month by hand they always look good and it's less work. Just my 2 cents."
5.0,Love Fiskars products.  They are very tough and work great
5.0,Just what I ordered and just what I expected.  Great pruning shears.
3.0,nice product
1.0,"I noticed that, right out of the package, the shears felt a bit stiff. After light use, the blades would no longer come together at the tip and, because of this, could no longer be locked. While the blades were definitely sharp and continued to cut branches near the pruner's hinge, they were not properly adjusted and would not cut anywhere near the tip.

I've contacted Fiskars (warranty@fiskars.com) and hope they'll honor their lifetime warranty at no expense to me. Maybe the next pair will be better."
5.0,love it
5.0,gift - hit
5.0,
5.0,The best basic pruning shears. Well made and do the job. To be fair I broke my previous ones because I kept using it on larger branches than I was supposed to.
5.0,exactly what was needed - performs great
5.0,"These shears are so nice and sharp. I use them to pick herbs from my garden, trim the ends off of flowers in a bouquet, and any other outdoor use that requires more than a pair of scissors."
5.0,ok
5.0,these are nicer than i expected
5.0,"I feel silly giving 5 stars for a sprayer but given how unreliable products are these days, I guess I can't take anything for granted. It works great - no issues. Has good pressure for cleaning, within limits ofcourse. And has good reach."
5.0,"I point it at things, they get wet."
5.0,Simple is better.
5.0,"After getting tired of replacing fancy looking plastic nozzle, I love these. Simple, long lasting, reliable."
5.0,A great spray addition!
4.0,i don't need a fancy nozzle with 10 different settings I will never use.  I can adjust the spray with my grip  Is solid and hopefully will hold up to the beatings.
4.0,Great for the price.  Nothing fancy but it does the job.
1.0,"Mine just arrived and the word ""Zinc"" is nowhere to be found. Instead, it's described as ""HEAVY DUTY METAL"". Luckily, it's a painless return."
5.0,perfect for me to use!
2.0,DO NOT EXPECT TO DO ANY REAL WORK WITH THESE PRUNERS AS THE BLADES BUCKLE UNDER PRESSURE
5.0,"Solid set of shears. My Mrs. uses these quite often. It was on her Christmas list. Cut paper well, I'm sure when the snow is gone they will get plenty of use."
1.0,"Broke after 3 small branches!!  Seemed dull to start with, don't waste your time and money!"
5.0,Fiskars a good name in Pruning Shears.  I'm looking forward to pruning my garden this spring.
3.0,"Nothing spectacular, but a solid shear. While it says it should clean better, my lavender bush makes this thing stick after a few cuts, even when clean. The grips are comfortable though, which makes doing yard work a bit easier on my hands."
4.0,"MADE IN CHINA! Not in USA, like one reviewer stated. They feel kinda cheap in your hand.... But they work! And my wife likes them (which is most important). For $10, I can't complain too much. Of course, time will tell!"
5.0,Very pleased.
5.0,always good to have another pair of these for my yard
4.0,Strong and sharp.  Got it as a deal of the day.
5.0,"Quality, Classic, reliable."
4.0,Works.  Seems solidly built.  It's clearly not cast zinc but has a nice finish.
5.0,Item was shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected.
4.0,"We may love it, but we haven't used it yet. Thank you for prompt shipping. Right price."
4.0,Metal not plastic! The high 'quality' nozzles do not deliver the pressure this reasonably priced classic does! I would give it 5 stars if the wire stay was more durable.
5.0,works great is as advertised  nothing special just a nozzle
5.0,"I have been looking for an ""old school"" nozzle, as all the new designs have sorely disappointed. and all the nozzles of this variety purchased at retail locations were very poor quality and did not perform to my satisfaction.  Would definitely recommend and purchase again!"
5.0,Excellent basic nozzle and will hold up longer than comparable plastic ones.
5.0,"Thank you, very fast delivery. Well received. AA+"
5.0,Good nozzle Decent price
5.0,"As an avid gardener, I love these. Nice design for my hands, excellent, smooth cutting.  As a thrifty gardener, I am super happy with a price of about  $10. I  considered getting more than one!"
5.0,Awesome! My 6 years old boy can use it and help me in the garden.
5.0,High quality tool! Very sharp right out of the packaging! We started using them right away and love them.
4.0,Very sharp and does a good job.
5.0,Great for pruning my plants. No complaints at all.
5.0,Great product
4.0,"Buy these about every two years and they get used. I kind of wish they lasted longer (the second year is rough), I wonder if there is a sharpener..."
5.0,I have these already & decided we needed another pair because they work so well & I hate gardening along.  Bought these on a lightening deal so now both my husband and I can clip together.  I hope that means the yard work gets done twice as fast and not that I have a pair of these for both hands. .... I am happy with my price.
5.0,Great Product!
5.0,I Have been gardening for 30 years and these pruners are worth your money!
5.0,Good quality on a classic design.
5.0,Always had a hard time trying to find a hose attachment that wasn't plastic. This is perfect in every way
4.0,Good old fashioned metal sprayer.
5.0,"I was looking for a no thrills nozzle that wasn't made from plastic parts with 90 different settings like are sold in every store.  I found this on Amazon and it worked great!  It is all metal, works great, and reminds me of the ones I used as a kid in the 1980s.  Unfortunately, I forgot it in Arizona when I moved and will end up buying a new one in the spring when the snow melts up here in the northeast.  When I do buy a new one it will be this same model."
4.0,"My previous Gilmour was made in USA, this one is now China.  Still works good."
5.0,"Feels like the sturdy nozzles of my youth, even though it says ""CHINA"" on it.
Puts out twice the spray of my old plastic crap nozzle."
5.0,Makes watering the lawn feel like I'm at the gun range with an unlimited supply of ammo.
1.0,"Gilmour changed the long standing Lifetime Warranty to a measly 3 years. I hate when companies do these kinds of things. It is either due to a lack of faith in their product, a cheapening of the quality of the product that they feel they can no longer stand behind or a it's a simple money grab. Sorry Gilmour, you lost my business."
5.0,Too bad it's made in China but it's a great nozzle.  I bought an extra for the other hose.
5.0,Good product fast shipping thanks
5.0,Nice sturdy and sharp
5.0,"Very comfortable, would recommend."
5.0,good product
5.0,"Excellent product.  Very sharp, easy to use, has a well place locking mechanism for easy put away."
5.0,Very sharp
5.0,Great for use in the garden!
3.0,"Cut descent, but they are low budge. Nice back up pair though."
5.0,These are the best hand pruners on the market.  Have used numerous pairs over the years.  Now if I can only find a way not to  drop them in the yard.
5.0,These are easy to use and very sharp.  I am very happy with my purchase.
5.0,Sharp and easy to use! Quite comfortable in the hand for trimming.
4.0,Works great. Perfect replacement for its easily breakable plastic counterpart.
5.0,Simple design insures dependability.
5.0,"Good old fashioned and sturdy hose gun.  Nothing like them.  The other ones (plastic fan, etc.) all eventually break.  What happened to the tree huggers?  Too much waste these days.  This gem is just what the doctor ordered."
5.0,"After wasting a bunch of money on cheaply made nozzles I bought from target, home depot and then Walmart, I finally gave up and found one online that has good reviews and was not expensive at all. I LOVE this spray nozzle as much as a person can love a nozzle! It does not inhibit the flow of water, it lets the water come out full force. Just what I wanted! And it is sturdy. I don't see it breaking anytime soon. Two manicured thumbs up!"
5.0,"Finally a hose nozzle that doesn't break in a week!  I have used all the new different types of nozzles only for the plastic to break in weeks.  Now I'm not sure if that is due to poor manufacturing or the fact that we live in Florida.  The sun here is strong and could be the culprit in the breakdown of the plastic.  Regardless, I don't have to worry about that now.  The metal can really hold up to the elements."
5.0,as indicated
4.0,Does the job.
5.0,good workmanship is obvious
1.0,Crap. Lasted less than four months. Split at base. See photo. Made in China. Go figure.
5.0,"After replacing a half dozen cheap plastic nozzles over the last couple years, I decided to go back to an old fashioned metal one. This thing is a tank, and I can't see it failing anytime soon. About the only thing that could hurt this is leaving it pressurized in freezing weather."
5.0,It is a good product for pruning and maintaining the garden. Well made and it is sharp. Nkulikwa
5.0,These work well and I recommend them for general gardening use.
5.0,"great deal, works well."
5.0,Work great!
5.0,Fast shipping! Great shears!!
5.0,"This is my second pair of pruners. The first one lasted about 10 years with minimal care or sharpening. I've slowed down with my garden care, so this one should last even longer. The original had the lock break, so I hope this will be better."
5.0,"sturdy, well priced"
4.0,"Worked really well for about 2 months of weekly use on shrubs. Now it is kind of dull, so I sometimes need a help of scissors to sever some branches completely."
2.0,"The knob that keeps this pruning shears locked closed sticks way too easy. You'd think it'd be robust as it's to have in the garden, getting covered in dirt and sap... but it did not hold up well at all."
4.0,"These pinch your hand if you're not careful, but it's an ok product."
5.0,Much much much better than all the plastic versions.
5.0,"Well built, tight shut-off, nice even stream. What more could you ask for?"
2.0,Water comes too fast and it's hard to regulate so we switched to a nozzle that has multiple settings. If you're looking for another that has high power and a solid this would be a good choice however
5.0,Great nozzle spray/gun.
5.0,"Of all the various hose nozzles on the market, I find nothing lasts longer than this classic design.  There are no plastic pieces to break and it just seems to last for years.  I do add some grease to the threads when putting it on to both help with the seal and to make it easier to remove in the rare times when I need just a hose.  Eventually it will start to corrode inside and the stream won't be as nice and the handle will get harder to squeeze, but I'll take this design over any of the other fancier designs."
5.0,"Hard to find these locally, and they are well made"
5.0,Very good and easy to operate and fix. looks slim and gets your work done perfectly. Better than any of that plastic fancy sprinklers
5.0,All I need to say is that this just works.  It's the only nozzle you will ever need.  I'm really happy with the quality.
5.0,Best nozzle for twice the price.
4.0,"Nozzle is durable and easy to use, but the full-blast stream is somewhat offset to the side."
5.0,Very handy. Good size. Great for the gardener.
2.0,"Only a small area (about an inch close to the handle side of the blades) cuts.  The rest just bends the branches and takes way too much effort to figure out why only half the blade surface actually cuts.  I bought these to replace Fiskars pruners that are way past their prime. Since the part that actually cuts is so close to the handle, they have limited use.  I replaced these with Felco."
5.0,"Good product, well-made and very useful."
4.0,typical fisker product as you'd expect
2.0,"This unit nips branches just fine, but my problem is the overall craftmanship.  After about 3 uses, I noticed that one of the handles started coming loose from the metal shank underneath.  I had to take it upon myself to go to the store to buy epoxy to fix it."
4.0,ok
5.0,I do hobbiest gardening and these are just perfect for pruning and cutting. The blades are very sharp and the cutting action is smooth. I would recommend then to anyone.
1.0,These don't work. The branch of my peace lily just turns sideways and slides between the blades. Tried them on a quarter inch tree branch afterward and the shears just chewed the bark. Odd.
5.0,Great product.
4.0,Very good
5.0,"Very happy with it,  feels sturdy and should last quite awhile.  Note it comes with a rubber washer already installed."
4.0,Great n I like it
5.0,as advertised happy with purchase
2.0,"I thought I reviewed sprayers thoroughly and knew what I wanted...I was wrong! This simple sprayer is nothing but a 70's throwback and no longer belongs in our current society of ingenuity and convenience! First and foremost...it hurts your hand after using it for just a few minutes! Second...the crappy little ""hold-open"" clip that allows you to continuously spray...just broke off after a few months! Overall...the design is just a fail as it's antiquated and severely lacking in performance. So...I'm not thrilled with my purchase of three of these items! If you don't want to acquire hand-fatigue...and if I had to do it all over again...I would spring for a Bon-Aire fire hose type nozzle (also here on Amazon).

**UPDATE - I purchased the Bon-Aire,,,I don't like that one either...its too large and the pressure is not as good as people say and I have excellent water pressure here (90 PSI). I haven't looked...but if I were...Id be looking for one similar to the old-style thin brass fire nozzles...but with a rubber coating for better grip. Im sure there is something out there...but these two are not it! Good luck in your search!"
5.0,Really has a great jet stream which totally increases the distant range I have when watering.  I love it!!
3.0,Worked good at first.  After a few weeks it would not shut off all the way. The mechanism sticks so you have to constantly adjust it.
4.0,Nice but it says to make sure to wash hands after use can cause cancer??
5.0,There is definitely a difference between this any anything you will find at a big box retailer. Its the bmw of pistol grip nozzles.
5.0,"Works well, I can stand in one corner of the yard and precisely water the plants on the other side. I like the sturdy construction, hope to use it for a long time."
2.0,"Nice metal nozzle which unfortunately has a tendency to keep spraying when I release the handle. I have tried to adjust it without success. I get around the problem by manually pulling the handle back which stops the flow, but this is not particularly efficient or always possible when my hands are both occupied."
4.0,Just as expected.
5.0,Useful
5.0,Awesome! So sharp! Made my life so much easier!
5.0,Great construction. A good quality Pruning Shears.
2.0,Spring not strong enough to open the blades.
4.0,"These pruning shears are comfortable in my hand, cut cleanly, and the locking mechanism operates easily. My only quibble is that the hinge bolt sticks out about an annoying  inch."
5.0,These are perfect!
5.0,Great tool for the yard work
5.0,LOVE
5.0,These are some great shears.they are very durable and don't rust
1.0,The end that the hose screws into was not threaded.
1.0,Lasted 3 months before back bolt broke clean off.
4.0,"does the job, standard nozzle, no frills, but cheap enough."
5.0,great for my terrace
3.0,"quality not good, water come out from nozzle is not smooth, also it has leaking problem."
5.0,Durable. Seals extremely well. Simple is often better.
3.0,leaks a bit but it's metal so when it drops 7999 times it won't break. decent and better than the screw kind.
5.0,Great Purchase
5.0,Prefer these to plastic.
5.0,Item as stated.....fast delivery
5.0,"Nice shears...I use these.  My wife uses the expensive ones.  For future designs, I suggest that the color of the handles be changed to yellow to help prevent them from being thrown away (camoflaged with leaves, etc.)."
5.0,"First unit had a mechanical defect, but Fiskars replaced it under warranty with no fuss and no requirement to return the original unit.  The replacement works perfectly.  We own several Fiskars items, and we are happy with all."
4.0,Heavy duty and very sharp.  Great price for this quality.
2.0,These did not last but a few weeks before becoming hard to operate. I do use my tools heavily for my job.
4.0,Hard to keep sharp.
5.0,"Yet another great Fiskars product!  I was surprised at the size of branches these shears would cut, good leverage and sharp cutting blade."
5.0,"Sharp, cuts through surprisingly thick branches, and has a lock to keep it closed. All the must haves for a pruner."
4.0,Will wait for Christmas to open them. They look good.
2.0,"After first use trimming thin (less than 1/4"") branches of our christmas tree:
- the safety lock got loose after first
- coating on the one blade (steel) was scraped off by the other blade (black).

At the same time they were very sharp out the package but not sure how long they would stay in working and safe condition given how it all started. So they were returned."
5.0,Great for cutting flowers.
5.0,"I love this nozzle( just don't leave it out during a polar vortex, it exploded, my fault)"
5.0,very good
2.0,I bought this because so many people said that they were nearly indestructible.  I have only had them a short time and I am already having problems
4.0,Works well.
5.0,very happy
5.0,"Although this is a recent purchase, it appears to be very high quality and functions perfectly.  Only time will tell for durability, but I expect that this nozzle will last a very long time."
4.0,"This is the classic nozzle, well made and heavy duty. Does exactly what you expect when you squeeze to trigger- goes from fine mist to full blast. Only minor complaint is the little ""on-keeper"" metal clip on the back tends to fall off."
5.0,"I have used these for decades. They are the best hose nozzels on the market. I have tried others now and then because of sales, but they always failed too soon.  My two simply got old and rusty and I wanted to replace one. So I did."
1.0,it will rust in one week. NO GOOD
4.0,"so far ,so good it has lasted without breaking like the others."
5.0,"These have a ton of leverage, are sturdy, and are quite sharp. With them I can easily cut through branches up to 3/4"" in size (softwood)."
5.0,We had a pair of these before and lost them in a move.  They are perfect for trimming trees and shrubs.
3.0,I have used Felco before and try this. Prefer Felco for the constant and great performance
3.0,Bought for a Christmas gift
5.0,These are perfect for the weekend gardener. They can really cut through a gnarly branch.
5.0,Best pair of clippers I've ever owned
4.0,"not as ergonomically comfortable as I would have liked, but work well"
5.0,Great Sheers!
3.0,"Sharp pruners, but would like them to spring back open after a cut. Wouldn't buy again for that reason."
5.0,"Very handy, don't require a lot of hand strength to use."
5.0,Very good water pressure and variable settings makes it easy. The metal slide on the top will hold your settings so you don't have to keep pressing on the handle. Water spraying is strong and consistent!!
5.0,"Sturdy simple garden nozzle. My husband uses this for cleaning the RV, watering plants in our almost 5 acre lawn, and for gently watering sprouts from new plants in the vegetable fruit garden. Will last a long time."
4.0,wear glove if U use hot water
5.0,they are just what I wanted.
5.0,great nozzle I will buy another soon!
5.0,"Awesome. Works, doesn't break, good value."
5.0,Simple and perfect
5.0,"Works great and is holding up.  Powerful spray,"
5.0,"Sounds crazy, but I have tried MANY nozzles over the years and I have finally found the perfect one. Most are cheap with plastic trigger that break within a few months. This thing is heavy duty and should last for years."
4.0,"No frills, but solid and reliable.  I've got one of these that's 12 years old, and have broken half a dozen fancier hose sprayers during the same time."
5.0,"Strong, dependable, work well, and comfortable to use. My first pair has stayed sharp for several years. Bought another pair for front yard/back yard use and because they have been the best of all the pruners I have ever used."
5.0,NICE
1.0,"Used it to trim small bushes in my front yard and it bent somehow on the first cut.  The blades now hit early and it doesn't have the scissors effect, making them useless."
5.0,Exellent for pruning sharp cutt for roses
3.0,"They work O/K but are somewhat lighter, cheaper in quality than other shears I have purchased from FIskars. It seems that most companies today find ways to cut costs which result in cutting the quality of the item. I wouldn't buy again but would spend a little more to get a better quality pruner."
4.0,My second pair as backup
5.0,"I order a pair of these nearly every year, that's when I know it's Spring. It's not that they're not good and only last one year. I wear them out after a year. I use them in ways they weren't meant to be used and abuse them, but they keep on performing well. I just want a fresh pair to start each Spring with. I know it's nearly winter and I'm buying them early, but my pair is packed in storage from a move and I stupidly bought a cheap pair 'to make do with'. You guessed it, the handle broke with the first branch I tried to trim. These are worth the money."
5.0,"Was as expected, works great."
5.0,Wow!  I hadn't had a pair in too long-AMAZINGLY easy to use. I admit I've purchased off brands recently...there is a difference. Gonna stick with Fiskars-my hands and plants are worth it!
5.0,Nice Shears!
5.0,"My husband works at a place where he needed a pistol grip nozzle that would hold up better than the common plastic nozzles available in garden shops or hardware stores.  I showed him these on Amazon and he said  ""That would be perfect for me when I need to clean up.  Can you order me one please?""  I got 2 just in case I liked it too, and I do.  I like that its made of metal and will hold up.  It has an adjustable spray from soft to wicked hard spray.  You just cant find these in stores anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon!"
4.0,Can't get one of these things to last more than a single season no matter what model or manufacturer. First thing to go is the spring action in the trigger. It gets to the point that you have to assist the handle as you release the trigger to get it to shut off. This is not unique to this model so I give it 4 stars anyway.
1.0,"I was disappointed to find that the packaging has the following warnings: ""The brass in this product contains lead"" and ""This product contains  one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING."" This seems like more stress than I want from a hose nozzle, so even if this one is far superior in quality, I would rather have a safe cheesy plastic alternative. I wish that the warning had been disclosed in the product description so that I could make the decision before ordering it."
4.0,Durable.  That's what I want.  That's what I got.  And it doesn't leak all over my shoes.
1.0,"Just not like they used to be.  They used to last for years. The past 10 years now... every one I buy doesn't last 6 months and the thingy starts sticking and squirting water all over me. That has nothing to do with needs a new washer, for all you smartalexs that think a new washer fixes everything."
4.0,"While there are a lot of nozzles out there where you can switch the type of nozzle and with fancy grips, this on e is very practical and most useful. I have three outdoor water hydrants (as my plumber calls them). I have had the ones with switchable nozzles before (i.e. rain, stream, etc.) and find that they just tend to break very easily. The Gilmore full size pistol grip holds up very well and meets almost any need I have. I highly recommend this one. If you are tempted to buy another just come to your senses and stick with what really works."
3.0,so so
5.0,Old school design and well built even though made in china
4.0,"good product that i've used to replace my cheap plastic nozzles outside. the only complaint i have about it is you can get it for slightly cheaper at your local home depot, and it will also include a rubber cover for the threaded front of the nozzle."
1.0,"I fail to see how a  garden hose with the following warning: ""This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."" [The last part is in bold italics} can possibly be anything but 1 star."
5.0,Very effective . Comfortable .  A must have . Thank you very much .
5.0,They're a pair of pruning shears.  Works as described and we've even managed to use it to trim some pretty large branches up to 1/2 in in diameter.
5.0,Very sharp cuts through thick plant branches.
5.0,High quality hand pruner. I ordered this for doing a side job and it worked great. 5 stars
5.0,nice quality for the price
5.0,Great for all gardeners.
5.0,Very good
4.0,Does a good job and convenient to use.
5.0,"Great price, good quality, does the job!"
5.0,"work just fine, easy to use"
4.0,good old fashioned handle - hasn't broke yet over a couple of weeks like another brand we purchased that lasted 1 week.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,I love the smell of high quality tools in the morning. Smells like victory.
5.0,This is a great nozzle.  Very basic but just by squeezing the handle you are able to control the water flow.  Very heavy duty.
5.0,"Purchased this one, and liked it so much I purchased an identical one at Home Depot.  This one keeps a nice tight stream when needed whereas the one I got at HD will not.  Not sure why, since they are both identical in build, shape, and materials... perhaps the one from Home Depot was just a dud."
5.0,"We accidentally purchased two of these and only have one hose. I figured that since it was so cheap I would keep the extra one as a backup if something happened to the first one. A year later and only a few tiny spots of rust, the nozzle is in great condition. I love this nozzle as it is the type that I grew up with!

I would buy it again."
5.0,Best hose squirter out there!
3.0,"I ordered this Gilmour Full Size Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 573TF on a whim.  I had just placed an order for a spiral hose to put permanently in the boat for wash down, and it popped up just below the confirmation of placing the hose in my cart.  I am a buyer who looks a many items of the kind I am considering, but I just clicked on this and placed it in my cart and sent in the order.  When I put the two together and screwed them onto the fitting in the back of the boat, hit the bait well switch only a small trickle of water came out.  I had screwed the nozzle on tightly to the hose fitting with a wrench, so it would not come off the hose without another wrench handy and I had left it in the garage at home.  So I am still not sure if the hose or this nozzle is the problem.  I will revisit this review after finding out for sure which it is, as I know it is one of the two of these devices that is the problem, since I removed the hose from the boat, turned on the switch again and water gushed out of the hose fitting on my boat, thus plenty of water pressure for the water to get through the hose and nozzle.  I change whichever is the culprit's review to reflect my annoyance.  I had hoped both of these items would be a trouble free solution to washing down my boat, but no, something had to foul up and cost me some grief.  More later after I solve this dilemma."
5.0,"Old school, this nozzle works like the one I grew up with...  Just works. nothing fancy, Just works."
5.0,I'm watering the hell outta some plants with this
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and needed.  And no trip to Lowes.  Carolyn Simpson
5.0,great
5.0,Nicest shears I ever bought!
5.0,"Great shears, cut very well, even through thick branches."
5.0,"Typical Fiskars quality. Sharp, well made and a bargain price. I ordered 2."
4.0,GREAT
5.0,they work great
4.0,Works great for the most part. I just wish the spring would open the handle more consistently. It sticks when you squeeze the handle to cut sometimes.
1.0,Second pair of these that have broken after initial use.  I received a replacement and the pair was catching where the two blades came together.  Would not recommend as the quality is low.
5.0,"These pruners are great - this is my second pair, because a neighbor borrowed them and fell in love with them, so easier to get another pair than wrestle them off her!  Ergonomic, very sharp blades, long-lasting.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Works great. Contains a little lead so I wash my hands after I use it.  I reminds me of the one that I used as a kid.  I didn't get lead poisoning back then so the hand washing is probably unnecessary.
5.0,"Just like the one Granny had, and just as good.  the plastic ones don't seem to last, this one has and I use it a lot.  Good purchase."
1.0,Why would a product that's meant to be kept outside rust?
5.0,"A good value.  Well made, unlike some others I've tried."
5.0,"This is the one you want! Old School nozzle made of...metal!! Yes, metal. Instead of the crappy plastic ones that break in a year, this is metal."
3.0,"I was told this was a great hose nozzle, so I tried it.  I just wanted to water my garden, but the spray on this nozzle feels too powerful sometimes."
5.0,I got this to replace our plastic nozzle that was leaking all over the place.  This thing is built nicely and feels high quality when using it.  All metal and variable spray based on how much you squeeze the grip.
5.0,"classic old school...my plastic ones always break so this was a good option, ive dragged it on the floor and cement seems to hold up well"
5.0,"Just like the good ol' days when things were actually built to last, the Gilmour Nozzle feels hefty and solid.  I've dropped mine on the concrete a couple of times when washing the car and it still looks and performs perfectly.  I personally think it's the best hose nozzle for the money."
4.0,"I was sick of buying nozzles for my hose almost every year because something breaks from my old models.  This one was highly rated and I decided to give it a try, but usually I am a fan of the firehose style nozzles where you don't have to keep squeezing a trigger, which would be the only reason I didn't give this a 5 star.  I find my hand tiring from constantly squeezing the trigger - and I can't seem to get the set screw to work (I thought you were suppose to be able to lock it in place).

The true test would be to leave it outside over the winter and see how it withstands the snow and ice."
5.0,They are sharp right out of the box. Easy to lock and unlock. And holds well even in small hands. Very good for woody plants that don't want to be pruned.
5.0,"I don't prune much, but these things are very good at trimming small stick and vines to 1+ inch branches."
3.0,"Did not stay sharp for more than 2 seasons, be ready to sharpen them."
3.0,"OK, not superior in my view."
5.0,I like it. Very sharp and does the job as described.
5.0,sharp
4.0,"These shears work well. I work at a flower shop and I left a pair at work because my boss doesn't buy new supplies very often and it gets used everyday. I like them because I am left-handed and these shears work well with either hands. Some shears we have at work have short blades, which makes it a little hard to cut ends of arrangements that have large stems, but these shears open fairly wide and the grip is soft."
4.0,Bought for cutting rose/flower before putting them in vases. Works well for that.
5.0,These work better than any other pair of shears I've used
5.0,Great value
5.0,Thanks.
5.0,Awesome. Like the ones your dad had years ago.
5.0,It works great and is inexpensive.
4.0,"shipping was great,and product seems very sturdy & well made"
5.0,Good nozzle. Finally! Forget all the plastic junk. Old school works better and lasts longer. Love this nozzle!
5.0,Its metal not plastic It may contain small amounts of lead big deal. So does the plumbing in your house if its built before 1984. Nice narrow spray no leaks
5.0,"I bought some of those expensive hose nozzles that look so cool. They either didn't work or they didn't last.

Saw all the great reviews on this one and thought I'd try. Wow, what a great nozzle! And the price is 50-75% less than those fancy ones.

Highly recommend."
5.0,"Inexpensive and built to last! Very simple but feels solid. From fan to jet it does it all and won't break like even the more expensive, multi-spray rigs. This is the perfect mouse trap, IMHO, the others are just trying to improve it."
5.0,"This sprayer is incredible for the price! The spray is controlled by the squeeze of the handle instead of on the sprayer itself. With this, very little water flow from the faucet is needed to get a spray strong enough to blow items from the patio across the back yard and almost tear the paint off the house siding, as I found out within 60 seconds of handing the sprayer over to my son to rinse the patio."
5.0,"Very simple design and construction, but that's all a garden nozzle should be. At this price point there is not a better pistol grip nozzle on the market. And this one will stand up to time and the elements."
5.0,Very nice
5.0,"I am not sure why I waited so long to buy these.  These cut through thick items like butter.  The only issue I found was cutting a dried palm frond that was pretty thick.  The cool thing about these bypass pruning shears is they don't ever seem to try and pinch you.  It's hard to explain, but on my cheap set, (one metal blade cuts into a plastic blade) I am quite certain that I would have accidentally pinched my hand during the course of about 30 minutes that I used these.  The lock mechanism is much more efficient and does not appear that it will break.

I wish I had more to say.  These are awesome, and again I am not sure why I didn't buy them sooner!"
1.0,"I have been a loyal Fiskars customer for many years, until TWO pairs of these pruners changed my mind. While I appreciate that Fiskars offers a ""lifetime warranty,"" it is hugely annoying to be photographing them, sending info to Fiskars, etc. I had a pair of these from about 2008 that worked like a champ and even had them sharpened once or twice. However, pruning the tough stalks of a plant like bamboo will eventually wear out any pruner. So I purchased this figuring they would work as well as the prior pair had. I do not know where the older pair was made, but the new ones were both from China. I have some Fiskars left-handed scissors I have used for sewing for a at least twenty years, and they were from Europe, and they are excellent. Times change, but the quality of these pruners has as well. Both the new pair and the replacement pair have the same problem-- as the jaws open and close it is as if the spring or mechanism in the pruner that forces the jaws back open after a cut is not strong enough. That makes a tendency for them to cut ""sideways"" a bit, and if you are using them in a wet environment that only becomes worse with more use. I struggled along with the first new pair for a couple of months, then contacted Fiskars for a replacement. I cannot fault their service as they responded quickly and did send me a replacement pair. Unfortunately, the replacement pair has the same exact problem. They worked great for about an hour of hard pruning then began to squeak and have the same have-to-open-the-jaws-by-hand after each cut. Very aggravating. I will not replace them again and I will be shopping for a more heavy duty pruner from a different company."
5.0,I had another pair of Fiskar's pruning shears that were assembled with press-fit pins that continuously worked loose and the locking mechanism would lock with every cut. This appears to be an improved version and I have no complaints.
5.0,"These are great for light use, I use them for random clipping when I'm hanging out in the yard and see something looking a little unruly."
5.0,GREAT!
5.0,great trimmers.
5.0,These shears work great! I even pruned a few larger branches with these and still were sharp enough later to cut the smaller baby leaves from my other plants.
2.0,"Ordered 2. One never open/closed easily. The other worked well for about 3 weeks, then got dull very fast. I never cut anything but flowers and vegetables."
5.0,It sheared my persimmons and guava very well.  Now I'm going to shear some more fruits.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"Bought the plastic one and it broke when dropped, this on is great. Better control and spray adjust-ability."
2.0,Nothing spectacular. Just a nozzle you can purchase from your local hardware store
1.0,"I can pick up a same price in local store right away, work 20 times better. It should be haft price of what ever I paid."
5.0,it works.
5.0,"Nice solid and metal. Fits, works, screws on with no problem. Good water pressure. Trigger locks like it should and water pressure screw actually operates as designed to. No leaking. It took me a long time to find a sprayer that would do what I needed with no hassles. This is the one. There aren't 4000000 different spray patterns, but really who needs all those anyway? The water pressure screw really lets you adjust to pretty much anything from a forceful stream to a nice gentle sprinkle."
5.0,"Don't by the foreign ones, this thing last forever."
5.0,Your basic sprayer.  Simple and effective.  Does not leak when screwed onto hose.  Great buy.
5.0,This is a goodie! You can adjust the type of spray with the amount of pressure. Simple!! Cheap! Good quality!
4.0,"I like this nozzle a lot.  It doesn't rust, has a good spray and seems to be made well."
5.0,fantastic
5.0,"That's what I was looking for. I would recommend this product! Overall, a very nice product."
5.0,These things are beast. I bought loppers and hedge shears. I gotta say these things are among my favorite. I cut with alot of different brands. I would have to say these things cut like butta. Fiskars is king
4.0,"Good strong set of shears, durable"
4.0,"They do as they say. My husband uses them mostly to trim stems when buying me roses so we haven't used them on large branches, but they are very well made and live up to the Fiskars brand."
5.0,Great tool.
5.0,Worked very good!  Well made!
5.0,These are great pruning shears.  I've had to get some bamboo in control after it took over a good part of my planting area.  These helped me trim the branches off so that I could get everything in the trash.
5.0,Very good product
5.0,Works Great thank you
5.0,Cheap quality but adequate for the summer.
4.0,"So far so good. I've only had it a few days and used it twice so I'm giving it 4 stars for initial impression and assessment. I'll update the post later on in the year. I like the quality feeling action of the mechanism, I just hope it lasts more than a couple of months. If you don't need different spray patterns, this is for you. But if you require various spray settings, stay away. This only goes from fine mist to jet stream."
5.0,Great value.
5.0,"Quality, Quality Quality. This nozzle is heavy and built to last. It works great for any application you would need. For me, just general watering and clean up."
5.0,"Best hose nozzle in the world.  All metal, simple, lasts a very long time.  It has been around 20 plus years.  Still the best."
5.0,Old style. Works correctly.
5.0,Same type my grandma used.  They just don't make stuff like this anymore.  Most stuff is plastic and made to be disposable.
4.0,Nice construction. Not bulky like some attachments on the market. Recommend.
2.0,"Sturdy and well made. Not well suited to gardening uses tho, probably better for car washing and other tasks where you don't need to vary the force of the water stream often. The mechanism for making it hands free fixes  the stream only in the full position - much too forceful for tender plants. Therefore your hand gets cold and cramped when holding the nozzle for very long."
5.0,"Well made, efficient, easy to control are hallmarks of this tried and true product. This is my second Gilmour hose nozzle. The first lasted thirty plus years.. It allows you to manipulate the water stream from broad to focused and to adjust the force of the water just by using the grip. I still prefer rain for watering the flowers and filling bird baths, but if it is not available, I will use this to do these and other outdoor tasks."
4.0,good
4.0,"Great tool for pruning. Mentioned it's sharpness.
Love it."
5.0,Work really well! Not a lot of force needs to be used. My only desire is that I wished they opened slightly more. But they were perfect for cutting down/pruning my perennial garden and even trimming an elderberry tree.
5.0,These have a good grip and action.  The lock works well and the blades cut nicely.  I am happy with these shears.
4.0,Not a bad shears but not exactly the one I was looking for.  The mechanism wasn't too smooth - because of a bad hand I had difficulty working the button. It was tighter than I would ordinarily want.
5.0,"work great, great price compared to local garden center"
5.0,very good
3.0,its okay... should have been sharper.
5.0,These work great
5.0,"I was looking for bypass pruners with a good locking mechanism, this one has been great so far."
4.0,"Really sharp and easy to use. I'm not sure how I need to clean this, but it's started to jam up a little after using for a few months. Overall, it was priced well and works fairly decently."
4.0,"These have worked great all summer. However, after two months of heavy usage, they have dulled and a screw fell out rendering them useless. I gave it four stars because we have used them a lot."
1.0,It broke the 1st time I used it. Had to return it.
5.0,Best pruning shears I've ever owned and at a great price. I especially like the narrow pointed end that is able to get into tight places. The blade finish makes them easy to clean.
5.0,Great product and price
5.0,"Very good seller. Thank you. My colleagues like it very much. Oh I will come again next time
."
5.0,Perfect for pruning and overall yard clean-up.
5.0,great for trimming shrubs
5.0,easy to use.
5.0,"Well made, sharp and fits hand perfectly."
5.0,Great nozzle feedback (doesn't get stuck).  Good value
5.0,"Good, basic nozzle. It's old-school style like you remember from when you were young (or younger). The stream is adjusted from wide-to-narrow based on how far you depress the handle. Good quality at a cheap price."
4.0,"I bought this because the cheap plastic hose nozzles I had been using kept breaking, and I liked that it was all metal.  On this one, you adjust the spray by increasing or decreasing the pressure applied to the handle.  A little bit of pressure gives you a wide, relatively soft spray.  More pressure gives you a jet that shoots maybe 20 feet or so.  Even more pressure gives you more water but less distance.  Works really well -- much easier than having to look down and adjust the setting on the plastic nozzles that I had used previously.  When I bought it I didn't see any information on where it was made, but it has a big ""made in china"" stamp on it.  Despite that, it feels like decent quality, but I've only had it a few weeks."
3.0,"This nozzle looks very durable. However, water pressure must be turned on very low in order to water potted plants. But for heavy hand watering it's great."
1.0,i bought this pistol grip nozzle specifically because I needed to be able to stop the water flow of the hose while going from place to place.  Well this is not the product to do so.  From the first use water has leaked/sprayed out of the nozzle.  All attempts to fix this have been in vain.  Basically a piece of junk and a loss of $6.
5.0,Works just like it should.
5.0,"Must buy, it's better than the plastic ones they sell on Amazon."
3.0,"spend a bit more money and get a better alternate I've to this.  It lasted about 3 months.  Had plastic inserts, not all metal."
2.0,"UPDATE:
This sat around my garage for one winter and is now basically unusable. The little adjustable screw on the back got a little rusty and now sticks, making it difficult to turn the nozzle on and off. I've started using a ""Fireman style"" nozzle and like it WAY (WAY) better. Get one of those instead.

OLD REVIEW:
This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!

My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly e.g., it's not an even ""circle"" of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal."
5.0,Cuts with ease
5.0,This is a very simple product but fiskars for some reason always ends up with better products. the blades on the shears have stayed sharper longer than any other brand i have tried. and the locking mechanism on the side is very no nonsense.
4.0,Work good according to my husband!  Wouldn't change anything.
4.0,Easy pruning with plants that are dime and quarter thick. Sharp and works well. Haven't tried with anything bigger than a quarter.
5.0,Good product.  Good price.
5.0,"I like these a lot -- I bought them last May to cut back our lilac and forsythia bushes which hadn't been pruned in several years. The shears cut easily through both thick and thin stems, you can even cut several thin branches at once. I've since used them on average of once a week to cut and trim back tree branches and saplings as well as roses and other bushes. Fwiw, they do tend to do better on green or growing wood than on dead branches. As another reviewer noted, the foam handle covers can slide off but I glued mine back on and haven't had any problems since. The blades are easy to keep clean and the lock keeps them locked even if you say, toss them on the grass or a chair. Note, these aren't for pruning large tree branches or tough, thick bushes but they're great for basic pruning."
5.0,My fiance loves them!!!
5.0,Use it all the time.  Great tool.
5.0,"Great Purchase! Easy to handle, nice design, and trims about everything I have put my hands on yet...."
5.0,sharp and strong... exactly like shears ought to be
3.0,"Just so so . so easy to use .it work OK ! Can help me !  It is very cheaper than another ,"
5.0,"It is hard to find a metal nozel anymore.  This should last more than a couple of years.  I would recomend this for watering plants, washing cars, or any other general use."
4.0,"I used nothing but hoses like this as a kid 25 years ago when washing the car in the yard.  Almost forgot how awesome it is being able to quickly control the water power, spray and pattern with just one hand.  So far no leaks.. but the nozzle is a little bit skinnier and less substantial than expected.  So 4 star review it is."
4.0,"It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.

Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.

***Update*** (Aug 2014)
After several months of use, this is starting to rust. Although I love this nozzle, it's apparent that I will have to replace this at some point. I get that zinc isn't the same as stainless steel but if a nozzle can't survive outside in the summer under the deck for more than a few months, I think something is missing. When is someone going to come up with a ""outdoor"" product that can survive the outdoors for more than one season? Sorry, had to take a star away from 5 to 4."
5.0,"As much as I like the variety of having many spray settings with plastic nozzles, they just don't last, and fall apart at the least opportune time.  This nozzle may not have all the fancy features of the plastic nozzles, but it's a great value and you know that it's going to work.

Unless you really need all of the other spray settings, I recommend keeping it simple and getting something like this that's going to get the job done reliably."
1.0,"Within one month of using this item, a spray of water started leaking from the side.  Therefore, the pressure of the main stream of water was decreased and I couldn't spray anything without spraying everything else.  That should not happen within one month of use.  Next time, I will order a nozzle that sells for approximately the same price in which I can adjust the pressure and hopefully not have to worry about it leaking."
5.0,"This is my favorite nozzle.  I've purchased many more expensive ones, thinking the higher price means a higher quality....wrong!  This one works great!"
1.0,"This crappy product is a waste of time. The pressure comes out of this nozzle is worse than a faucet pressure, and that's me being generous. It can't even shoot the water more than 3 feet. Pathetic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,This worked great till the metal cracked at the stem. Thought this would last longer than the plastic ones.  :(
5.0,Best overall type of nozzel IMHO.  I've used a bunch of newer designs with fancy spray patterns.  While they are fine they really don't offer any advantages over this simple design and in my experience don't hold up as well over time.  Just another example fo the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid!)  :-)
3.0,"Overall they do the job I'd like them to do, but the ""lock"" slides really easily, so I have to often unlock the clippers while I'm in the middle of using them."
5.0,Fantastic shears with good grip and easy to use with items of varying thickness.
5.0,Very easy to use with one hand..precise and effortless.
4.0,they are ok
1.0,"Does not work well; sticks upon cutting and then doesn't open without pushing it, even after oil applied."
4.0,They work.(  : Completely satsified. Look they they will last a long time with proper care.
5.0,Really well made standard Bypass Garden Shears.  Our old pair finally died after many years of service.  We were happy to find we could still buy the old standby.  Highly recommended.  Well made.  Easy to use.  Cuts tuff branches.  I keep them clean with WD-40 for years of service.
5.0,Work well
5.0,sharp
1.0,"Blades seem sharp.  Will not spring open, requiring hand opening for every chop.  Body is too large and cumbersome for my hand.  I do a lot of pruning and hiking trail clearing.  This pruner is exhausting and stays home out-of-use.  I replaced it with an old one.
Kath Macaulay"
5.0,"After going through several plastic nozzles with fancy bells and whistle included, I thought I'd give this metal nozzle a shot and couldn't be happier. If you don't require an adjustable nozzle, give this nozzle a whirl. Given the quality, I have got to believe I'll have this thing for many years to come."
4.0,"This nozzle does a great job anywhere from a light mist (this takes some getting used to, hence the 4 stars) to full blast."
5.0,"did not try yet, dad in law found the old one so we did not use it yet, but will, and I am sure it will be up to our expectations."
1.0,"Product contains lead. There is a BOLD warning on the back that you must wash your hands after each use. Not something ideal for the kids, gardening, etc..."
5.0,"I have been stuck having to buy plastic nozzles for so long that I forgot how wonderful these metal ones are! No leaks, sprays great, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a sprayer/nozzle. I have been through 4 plastic on in the last few years, and I can tell you this one...is going to last!"
5.0,"What you see is what you get - a well made, solid zinc hose nozzle.  I used to have those plastic nozzles with the multiple settings - flat, wide, full, shower, mist - and you never actually use any of them, and eventually the plastic breaks or starts leaking. This feels like it will last a long time, and it's great that you can change and type of spray just by adjusting the throttle of the handle.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"had a few nozzles but none hold up as good as this one. mainly got cause we kept smashing them with the car/truck, so i bought this cause it looks heavy duty. It's been run over a few times, still works great."
5.0,I owned lots of different nozzles. This one beats them all! You adjust the spray by the amount of pressure you hold on the pistol.
5.0,I needed a replacement for my old hose nozzles that kept breaking. I was surprised with how well made this is. I am going to be buying a second one soon. A++
5.0,But I guess that just describes the quality of the build. It sprays well and hopefully will last longer than the cheaper ones I use to buy.
5.0,I use this often.  Sturdy.  Great product.
1.0,"Blade deformed on first use when trimming a <3/8"" branch when packaging/website says ""Maximum cutting capacity: 5/8 inch diameter"". Returning to Amazon. Very disappointed since we have another Fiskars pruning shears from 2005 that still cuts like a champ."
5.0,Work grear
1.0,"Blades made of soft metal, got notch and now get stuck all the time. In my book these are junk"
5.0,Easy to use.
4.0,Great quality. Fast delivery.
5.0,"I have always had good luck with fiskar products and I am not disappointed with these, I had an old pair of cheap shears that finally died and bought these on amazon because of the convenience of shopping online, I am glad that I did."
5.0,"very good quality, as expected from Fiskars.  I trust these will serve me well for years to come."
4.0,sharp trimmers
2.0,"These clippers don't work very well -- very sticky and no spring in handle makes clipping tedious.  I tried greasing with WD40, but still terrible. I will go back to my old ones."
1.0,I ordered this nozzle because I thought it was fairly non toxic yet when it arrived the package had a lead warning on the back. Not what I wanted for my garden. :(
5.0,"Great, simple hose nozzle. I like that it's metal so it won't break easily if dropped on cement, like plastic ones will do. There's a good range of spray from light shower to hard est spray. It's perfect and a good price for what you get!"
5.0,"I have tried several different hose nozzles and this one beats them all! Don't waste your money on fancy ergo grip bla bla bla, this one just works perfectly,

The jet stream this gun puts out is super strong and ease back on the trigger and you get a nice uniform spray.

I had also purchased a Nelson Brass Sweeper Nozzle 50161 for Driveway cleaning but it can't even compete with the Gilmours jet stream so the Nelson is going back to Amazon."
4.0,"Doesn't corrode or rust. This is a must have in FL. Not as neat of a spray pattern as the adjustable style, but good."
5.0,"It simply gets the job done.

Don't buy one of the fancy, colorful, and more costly nozzles that quit after a short time."
5.0,"I love this nozzle.  It's a bit difficult to fill a bucket with it, but other than that, it's perfect for what I use it for."
5.0,This is perfect - Just what we needed - a good old fashioned water pistol like the good old days!- Thank you!
5.0,I had a brand new plastic nozzle first use broke and I got it off the T.V. with the shrink hose. This one seems vary durable.
5.0,"It works perfectly well. No complaints, and that's all you can pretty much ask of a product like this. Also, it's very affordable and durable."
4.0,"The nozzle seems sturdy and well built. I don't have any concerns dropping the nozzle on concrete driveway like I do with the plastic nozzles. The only drawback is that the bare metal does not insulate the cold water from your hands, so if you use in cold weather you're gonna need some gloves."
5.0,can't live without it.  Good quality.
4.0,These are good little pruning shears to have around. They're nice and sharp and the handle is comfortable. They've been great in the garden. I was even able to cut through small branches with ease.
5.0,Good quality shears
3.0,"Good strength cutting tool, but a little bit bulkier than I was expecting. Powers through thicker, woody branches, but will also clip little budding greens if you're not careful."
5.0,I do a lot of garden pruning and I like these pruning shears by Fiskars because they can cut small clippings as well as larger branches. I rarely walk out into the yard without a pair of these pruning shears in my back pocket!
5.0,They get the job done. I have arthritis in my hands and they are easy enough for me to use. Good price too.
5.0,"Very sharp and comfortable to use. Use to trim rose bushes. Have also easily cut 1/2"" diameter sticks."
5.0,Works just as expected.  Good pair of cutters.
5.0,Fantastic. Wont need to buy another pair of shears.
5.0,"LOVE this product.  Shipped fast, well built, and works exactly as described.  I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,"Classic design, that just works. After bad luck with plastic hose nozzles that look fine, and includes countless settings (which are admittedly useful), but tend to develop leaks and cracks, I went with the tried and tested metal design. Bought two of these. Very  happy with them so far. They do not offer the range of settings (such as mist), but can be adjusted from a controlled jet to a wider dispersion spray, which is fine for most uses. Very solidly made.

I do recommend ordering additional washers along with this nozzle, though, as those will need to be periodically replaced. These should do the trick: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-01RW-Rubber-Hose-Washers/dp/B000NCWP44/ref=pd_sim_lg_bsb_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1NHH0PZQFEG0Z8E8421W"
5.0,I have bought several other sprayers and paid a lot more for them.  So glad I found this on Amazon.  Simple and well made.  I will be buying my son one for his new house.
5.0,I should have bought these years ago. They have already shown me that I'll have water where and when I want it with these simple nozzles.
1.0,Nozzle is made in China and seems sturdy at first but cracked within six months under light usage. I would not recommend this product.
4.0,I was searching for just a simple nozzle for my back yard (city backyard). I have a concrete backyard & needed something to wash my patio furniture and leaves etc. This is a classic piece no fuss just push and go. I'm not very strong in my hands so this was a great choice in that factor. Also the power is quiet strong.
4.0,"Contain a product that may cause cancer (California).  If I know that before, I will not buy it. But it's still a very good quality product for the price.  Garanti for life.  Will have to clean the hands each time I will use."
5.0,"This is definitely a good quality nozzle. It is similar to the ""old fashioned"" type nozzle we had as kids. It gives differing spray patterns depending on how far you squeeze the trigger."
5.0,Easy to use with solid performance.  No worries about dropping it on the driveway while washing cars.  Can't go wrong.
5.0,"I've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break, get stuck on the end of the hose, or don't have enough power to really blast things with water. This nozzle is durable, easy to remove, and super strong!"
5.0,"It's basic and well made.  I bought it because I live on 5 acres with old pine trees that keep dropping branches.  I have to burn a pile of limbs every two weeks so I needed a good, strong nozzle.  I'm happy with it.  I shoots quite a stream and is exactly what I needed.  It also has the threads that can attach to a hose-end sprayer bottle for fertilizer, house wash, or insecticides."
1.0,Poorly made!  Don't withstand moderate use!
5.0,They did the job. Yes
4.0,"These were put in an auction basket I put together, looked great"
4.0,The shears are well manufactured and a great buy.  I use mine quite often and the locking aspect makes them greater.
5.0,"These are sharp and easy to handle, they make sure work out of woody stems.  Significantly better than the pair I received a discount on and at normal price are cheaper than those."
5.0,HEAVY DUTY NICE A SHARP
5.0,These cut beautifully! Great buy- so versatile!
1.0,"Not that impressed with these. Was trying to cut down some ornamental grass, and the blades just slip off. I would have been better off getting the ""guillotine"" type. I think that would work better on the harder stuff. These worked ok on softer branches."
4.0,"Good one; no issues yet. Sharp, protection for storage looks good"
5.0,Wonderful!
5.0,"I am a small woman and the pistol grip on this sprayer is very easy to grip and hold.  For me, this works much better than the twist control nozzles."
5.0,"I love the feel of this nozzle. It feels sturdy and well-made, like it will last a long time. I've had it for a few months and haven't had any problems with it. It only really has two spray styles, a wide cone when the handle is only partly squeezed, and a straight, laser-like spray when the handle is fully squeezed, but that fulfills my needs well. This is a great nozzle."
5.0,"This item is solid quality Firm grip, water pressure knob can be easily adjustment without the use of a pliers. I would recommend to anyone."
5.0,"i use to always the buy the adjustable stream plastic nozzles because i could never find this one at any hardware store. the plastic ones broke on me whenever i used them the most. now that i know i can find this on here, i will continue to get them here."
5.0,"Nothing works better than the simple old school hose gun like this. No silly plastic rotator nozzles or clicky crud. These just work.
The pattern of the stream changes based on how hard you squeeze the handle.
They are metal, they can be dropped and tossed around without fear of breaking.
Strong enough for commercial use."
5.0,"So far, no complaints!
Very functional, easy to use, does what it says that it should do.
Great for car washing!"
5.0,Awesome nozzles.  Unfortunately they don't last forever but I keep on buying them.  They are used continuously on our dairy farm so  I wouldn't think they would last forever.
4.0,"One thing the product information does not mention is that the brass coating on this nozzle contains lead. The packaging for the item I received has several large warnings on it telling me to wash my hands after using it because of the lead. I don't personally consider this to be a big deal (I don't have any small children in my garden who might stick this in their mouths or something), but none of this was mentioned at all when I was researching this item.

So far, this seems to be a very sturdy nozzle. I used to use one of those plastic nozzles with the rotating front for 10 different spray types, but I discovered I only ever actually used two of them, and when it started to leak after last winter's sudden freeze, I decided to replace it with a more sturdy model that had fewer settings. So far it has worked great."
5.0,Great hose nozzle that's super easy to use. It doesn't have different settings on it. It does different stuff depending on how hard you squeeze the handle. You can water plants and get a stream to clean stuff. No leaks. It's solid.
5.0,We bought several of these to use in our horse barn and they are working out really well. They don't fail quickly like the cheap plastic stuff and the spring is strong too.
5.0,Nice pruners. Used them for my fruit trees in the spring. Great product for a great price!
5.0,Nice
5.0,Great feel and quality
3.0,average pruner
5.0,Nice quality pruning shears
5.0,Sharpest and easiest to use shear I've tried in six decades of gardening.
5.0,"NICE,STRONG GOOD QUALITY ,, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. MY WIFE LOVE IT."
4.0,"Caution: I originally ordered this pruner based on the mostly positive reviews and having seen them in stores. Unfortunately, the first pair of pruners arrived DOA. The blades were bent it seemed, so that they couldn't close more than half way and you couldn't cut anything. I tried to bend them back open slightly so they would pass by each other, but was unsuccessful in getting them to open/close reliably to get some gardening done. The first pair are being returned, but I got another pair and they worked perfectly out of the box. Overall, I am happy with the ones that work. If I were in the store, I'd check to see if they open and close routinely without a hiccup. My guess is Fishers needs some better QC.

TL;DR: First pair was DOA, second pair works well."
5.0,Great Shears.  Perfect for trimming some bushes
5.0,The shears are great--just what I need. They are easy to hold and cut bigger stems than just grass cutters.
1.0,"Bought this item 6 months ago, went to use it today to find the metal finish pealed, rusted and corrosion had eaten a hole in the handle making it useless."
5.0,"I bought this for work, we had tried every other kind of nozzle and somehow with-in 2-3 weeks the nozzles would be broken, somehow someway. Finally fed up i scoured Amazon and foudn this guy, and We've now had this in our store for over 6 months. THAT is saying something!"
2.0,"metal too soft, its all wore out after light use, the thread on front already smooth out.
lots rust on the back puller/handle part, need something with better material, rather buy once and be done with it for many year."
5.0,"This nozzle works great!  I would certainly recommend this nozzle.  It is simple, affordable and seems very durable.  Nothing bad to say."
2.0,"Even though it's made out of quality materials and is a quality brand, this nozzle spray pattern is worse than if I put my thumb over the end of a hose. It's too bad that it's very rugged and will be around for a long time."
1.0,Broke first time I used it worthless. Don't waste a some on it.  Easier to use my thumbs. Thanks bye
5.0,"I get so frustrated when the other expensive fancy plastic nozzles break or leak.

These are 100% metal, inexpensive, and work great for years.

What's not to like?"
5.0,It is the best.  Reliable and works perfectly.  I ordered 4 of them and all works great!  I highly recommend it.
5.0,I love these old fashion nozzels. I call them old Fassion because my dad had these types when i was a kid. Durable and get the job done.
5.0,I attached these to a CNC and they have held up very well in an industrial environment. No plastic parts to break and they do not leak.
5.0,Fiskars is a brand that I've known to be of good quality.  I like this pruning shears as it is sharp and easy to hold.  Our roses would love it as my present one is already very dull ( no brand) and I feel bad when I prune the stems as it does not leave a clean cut which would hurt the roses.  With my new Fiscar shears I get a clean and sharp cut again.
3.0,"Nice shears, but lock mechanism slides to lock too easily when you're working"
5.0,"Excellent lightweight, strong pruning shears. Good size, too.  I thought they might be small given the lighter weight, but they are one.  Excellent for zipping through twigs and small branches.  Good and sharp."
5.0,Its great for trimming nearby branches especially those hard to cut
4.0,"Well designed, nice and sharp; does the job well."
5.0,"Good, sturdy shears for the money, light weight"
5.0,As described.
5.0,Have bought these for years and they only seem to get better with every pair I purchase. Love fiskars cutting tools.
5.0,Sharp
5.0,excellent
5.0,Good shears.
1.0,"It worked great at the beginning but after only two days of usage, the blades are sticking together after every cut.  I have to manually move the blades back to the open position."
3.0,They are great and easy to use.
5.0,"My old pair ,15 years old bit the dust , I couldn't get them sharpened , I will probably take to a shop because I love them , but in the mean while I ordered these and the quality is still excellent 15 years later."
4.0,"These work fine on green wood up to 1/2"" in diameter, but anything larger needs more leverage. The lock is easy to use and very accessable, making one hand operations a breeze. The best thing about these is that they'll fit in your back pocket and stay locked. I also have a ratcheting, anvil style clipper that works much better on slightly larger twigs with much less effort."
4.0,I live in a townhouse; and branches from my neighbor's tree were starting to take over my deck.  These shears took care of that problem without too much difficulty.
5.0,As the stars show I love the pruning shears
5.0,This is a very simple product but fiskars for some reason always ends up with better products. the blades on the shears have stayed sharper longer than any other brand i have tried. and the locking mechanism on the side is very no nonsense.
4.0,Product as described. Delivered on time.
2.0,cheaply made
5.0,Tried & true provides the function that you need without getting fancy.  Definitely a quality tool at a good price.
5.0,"Sometimes, keeping it simple is best, especially when its just something as basic as a water nozzle.  I've gone through countless 'fancy' gadget nozzles with this spray setting, etc., and all leak of failed at some point.  This works like the old school product that it is."
5.0,"I bought this particular nozzle because I was tired of the cheap plastic nozzles available everywhere you look.

It works great, you can adjust the water pressure using the knob in the handle just as you can with most similar models. The threaded front works well when combined with my brass hose nozzle which can create a more direct and powerful stream of water.

It's simple, doesn't rust or break as easily as the cheaper-made-but-still-more-expensive nozzles out there."
5.0,"This is a great nozzle. Good weight to it, solid feel, can get dropped and never look anything but brand new. That said, it has one speed: Full blast, baby! So if your grass or plants are the disobedient kind and need to be whipped into shape, throw this puppy on and get it under control."
5.0,Works just great.  Can get any spray I need just by squeezing more or less.  The hardware itself is simple and durable.
4.0,They are not as good as the ones I have bought before but so far they haven't come apart.  I bought a case so I hope they hold out.
4.0,"I like that it has some heft.  It feels and works like a real quality tool.

It is a bit hard to pull and hold the handle manually.  I've mostly used the loop to set and hold it at the setting I want."
5.0,"I love this nozzle for a number of reasons:

1. It's sturdy.  I'm clumsy with my things and being metal means it's less likely to break than a plastic nozzle (which I have broken a number of times).
2. It's simple.  Less parts, less problems.
3. It's very affordable.
4. It gives a range of spray simply through how hard you press, making it very easy to use."
5.0,"works great, cheap, doesnt leak, has held up to multiple washes so far. nothing special but works for what you need it for"
4.0,"What can you say about a simple nozzle?  It either works well or it doesn't...this one works well.  And why on earth does Amazon tell me that I have to use more words?  I had nothing else to say but they required me to use two more words. Well, I'm using lots more than two but I'm saying nothing important.  What's the purpose of that???"
5.0,Great pruners.
2.0,"I loved these pruning shears when I first got them, but the blade twisted when I was trying to cut through a branch that was thicker than I thought on a plant and now they're unusable. They two pieces hit one another instead of shearing past, so I can't close them to cut anything. I haven't yet contacted the manufacturer about a warranty replacement, as I was in the middle of the project and had to run to the store for a replacement same-day."
5.0,Great product
5.0,Excellent product.
5.0,Inexpensive and easy to use; perfect!
4.0,Work well... use them for snipping trees when fishing on banks
5.0,"These work ridiculously well. I had to trim quite a few branches for the front which were about 1/4"" thick and it was nothing. I also had to trim a tree which had 1"" and 2"" branches, they were not dead branches so they took a little bit of twisting but these bad boys get the job done. The trimming had to be done so leaves don't fall in my AC Unit outside."
5.0,"good quality, easy to use"
5.0,great product
5.0,"Excellent, I carry it in my golf bag!"
5.0,This thing works better than any nozzle we've ever purchased and is probably cheaper than all the others too.  Great Buy!
1.0,"This is NOT die cast zinc.  My sprayer has chipped and the grey paint has come off to reveal rusty metal.  If this were really die cast zinc, it would be solid, rust-proof zinc, not a coating.  I will not be buying anything from Gilmour in the future."
5.0,I like the feel of the nozzle.  Its a solid tool to have in one's arsenal.  Pretty solid in a hot and dry summer.
4.0,"Very simple inexpensive nozzle that just works.  It is also extremely durable, not at all like the more expensive plastic ones that have tons of features you never use!"
3.0,"As I said int he title I was very happy with this nozzle for months.  It sprays very well and very hard.  Then about two weeks ago I noticed  the small metal piece on the back that controls the water pressure stated to rust.  Now it sometimes sticks in the wrong position.  It is only a matter of time before it breaks off completely.
I can say I will not be buying another one from this supplier. In the future I will just buy  it from some big box store so that if this happens again I can just return it."
5.0,All metal works as it should. Hard to find an all metal nozzle at a local place but this one is what i was looking for.
3.0,"It worked great at first, it has smooth operation and the threads seal well to the hose.  It did start to leak at the top of the handle where the piston controls the flow of water.  It's not that big of a deal because you usually get wet when your using a hose anyway.  Just a little disappointed."
4.0,"Gilmour Full Size Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 573TF works as promised and did not leak. I can lock it on with the flip of a U shaped piece on the top. If I pull a little it has a mist or wide spray and as I pull the handle harder it goes into a stream. I did not see in the advertisement what I read on the package: ""NOTE: The brass in this product contains lead. WARNING This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."" I do like that it also says, ""LIFETIME REPLACEMENT POLICY A Gilmour product will provide complete satisfaction for the life of the product or it will be replaced free of charge. (Industrial and Commercial uses are excluded.)"""
5.0,"Great sprayer and well built . Has threads for attaching a hose to the outlet . Powerful spray and good mist spray . Feels heavy and sturdy . Made in China , but good quality , fit and finish . Looks like it should last for years ."
5.0,"just like the ones we had in the 60's
should last for years.easy to control pattern.no leaks.cheap but reliable nozzle"
4.0,So far so good!
4.0,"I have been using these all summer now, and really like them. The safety lock is easy to use, so this is easily used with one hand. The handles are comfortable and easy to hold. The blades are sharp and this works great for trimming up our bushes. I love the size of these, they fit nicely in my pocket, yet big enough to be effective.
I probably would have given it 5 stars, but I did bend the blades once trimming a small branch. This was my fault since I attempted to trim a larger branch then I probably should have. But it bent weird. I was able to bend them back, and get back to trimming again.
Overall, this are super handy to have around, and I'm glad I bought them"
5.0,These work perfectly. I have had no issues and it came on time and in the original package. Worth the buy.
1.0,"I would have given the shears 5 stars for the first time I used them.  The second time, I couldn't close them properly.  The 2 pieces were not connecting right and it was more work than it was worth."
5.0,Bought these for my daughter who got her masters degree in Horticultural and she loves these snippers. Well made and good reputations
5.0,"Nice simple shears, cuts through branches with ease. My mother loves them because she has arthritis in her hands and wrist and this product allows her to take care of her garden all year long."
5.0,"I absolutely love these and use them for hours a day in my yard, I take them with me on my daily walks as well for handy wild flower gathering."
5.0,"I LOVE it !!! very sharp, easy to use and lock."
5.0,As promised
1.0,Piece of crap. Metal does not align.  Therefore does not cut.
5.0,I purchased this item to replace a Nelson product of similar design that had broken the plastic trigger handle. I use this nozzle with hot water and so far it performs fine.
5.0,"Works great, no leaks, feels much sturdier than my previous plastic one that broke. 6 more words required five six"
5.0,"These are great spray nozzles.  I bought two, one for the front and one for the back garden.  They work so much better than anything else out there and have been around for years.  I think they'll last for quite some time because of being metal and strong.  No problems with them at all."
5.0,I love this thing because it is just like the ones we had when I was a kid.  This thing is built to last.
4.0,I was sick and tired of purchasing nozzles made of plastic and never lasting.  I purchased this and it appears to be holding up well and I hope it lasts a long time.
5.0,"Works quite well, and does not hurt my hands when used. Nice control on the spray beam as well. With the least amount of breakable or moving parts. Great."
5.0,"This is a great nozzle and ordered it after checking at [...] As explained by that website, this is a simple and effective nozzle. Much better than the cheap plastic ones you get at HD and lowes."
1.0,"I bought expecting an American Made product, Paid double when factoring in postage. Could of bought Chinese anyplace. Very disappointed that it was now a Chinese made product. Will never purchase again'"
2.0,"I purchased two of these nozzles a little over a year ago.  Both are starting to rust where the coating chipped off of the handles.  The nozzles are still functional, but I am disappointed by the quality given only one year of use."
4.0,I wanted something besides a cheap plastic nozzle and so far this one seems to work without leaking.  I would buy it again.
5.0,Good old fashioned all metal spray nozzle. Feels like it will last forever compared to the buy every year plastic ones. You can vary the spray based on the amount you squeeze the trigger which works fine.
4.0,"I love these. The are strong and comfortable to utilize. They have a hard time cutting really floppy greenery or the extra thick blackberry brambles that plague my yard but work well otherwise. I also use them to cut up bully stick chews for my dogs. These are really tough treats and it is cheaper to buy the larger sticks and make them smaller for my small pups.

Update: I've had these for 10 months and they're rusting. I've used these heavily so the blade is a bit dull and they squeak every time I cut something. Not a bad deal for 10 bucks but I'm going to buy something a bit higher quality to suit my needs."
5.0,Nice cutter !!!! Dennis PA.
5.0,"Super sharp, comfortable in your hand, and can different sizes of vines, branches, herbs, etc.  Love this handy tool for my growing garden and would recommend this product to anyone!"
5.0,sharp and well constructed
4.0,Works very well. Easy to cut things with.
4.0,Not sharp enough for thick plants!
5.0,Excellent quality.  Expected nothing less from Fiskars.
5.0,Good as expected.
5.0,Love them!
5.0,really great tool
5.0,Nothing special about it but it works and works great.  Sometimes the simpler tools are the best ones.  Plastic hose nozzles have broken and leaked for me.  I've had 0 problems with this one.
5.0,It looks like it is well made and should give me years of use.  The walmart ones don't hold up very well.
5.0,"I love to water my lawn. There is something very therapeutic about it. Over the years there have been a ton of new nozzles and grips that of come out. There's ones with the cool rubber pieces or the extra pressure pump, and I feel like some of them can even surf the web while you water. Here's why I like this one.

This specific nozzle has been around for as long as I can remember. My dad used it way back in the day, and it still works great for me today. They are long-lasting and durable, and if you are like me you like to throw your hose around and step on it and all that good stuff. This works great. No need to get all the fancy stuff when you can get this one and it works wonders"
4.0,I BOUGHT A HOSE AND I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I WILL NEED IT WHEN I WANT TO USE MY HOSE AT HOME.
5.0,"There is a good reason that this type of nozzle has been around forever. Its simply functions perfectly. No gimmicks, just works perfectly."
5.0,Other reviews are legit. This thing is good quality. Its heavy and looks like it will last quite a while.
4.0,"Sometimes keeping things simple is the best route.  The coating/finish on this nozzle resists corrosion well and, more importantly, an opportunistic dog.  I've replaced several nozzles that fell to the ground from the hose reel or off the ledge I store it on.  Each time, the handle, screw mechanism, or other critical part that was non-metallic ended up obliterated.  She always managed to find the weak link in each nozzle.

This nozzle isn't perfect (tension on the handle, no spray settings/nozzle adjustments, riveted handle pivot) but it is dog-proof."
4.0,"A no-nonsense, basic nozzle.

It doesn't leak.

It's sturdy.

It shipped quickly and came with a gasket that some cheap nozzles skip.

The last nozzle I had was plastic and lasted a week (and one drop to the concrete) before it shattered.  This seems much more durable."
5.0,I've had a number of hose nozzles as have most adults. I like this one the best. It allows more control of the stream. I have sprayed plants about 30 feet away and yet it is gentle on my tomato plants at close range. This is a quality product. Highly recommended.
5.0,This Gilmore nozzle is like the pistol grip nozzles used to be when they made good nozzles.  So far this nozzle is working good.
5.0,Good
5.0,For stems that are not flowering.
5.0,true to the fisker family of quality products
3.0,"These have quit cutting and the latch broke. After three weeks Fiskars had yet to answer any of my emails.

*I feel the need to up date this review. After five(5) weeks, ""out of the blue"", with absolutely no communication, a replacement arrived. I do not believe that they would have responded without an actual letter to their "" Customer Care Team"" in  Wisconsin. Web based correspondence seemed to yield no results. I changed the rating from a one(1) star to a three(3). They work pretty well.but Customer Support needs work."
3.0,Have used it for about 4-5 months of weekly once usage. Does the job fine with max 1/4 inch thick stems. But lost the sharpness for blade edge already.  That's only okay quality for me. It started making noise at the hinge cross section. That's signs of bad quality. Because I do take care of my tools. Do not recommend. Might look for a different brand next time.
4.0,"This pair of pruning shears is a bit large for my hand; otherwise, it's very good."
5.0,The shears are great--just what I need.  They are easy to hold and cut bigger stems than just grass cutters.
5.0,"Got this shears for my mom's garden. Of coure, she loves it and the blades are sharp too."
4.0,"Very nice, heavy duty trimmers. They're metal construction. Feel really strong and solid. Can't beat the price"
2.0,"bought a couple fiskars items with this order but am disappointed with the pruning shears.  They do not open and close smoothly, in fact both hands are needed to open again after a cut.  This was a gift to my daughter and her new rose bushes, sure glad I had my old reliable 20 year old Felcos.
Gave two stars because they are a feel good tool and will look good hanging in the garage. Contacted Fiskars for ideas to loosened the screw, no reply."
5.0,It is well worth the couple of dollars more to get the zinc nozzle instead of the cheap plastic ones.  These last for years and work 100% better.
5.0,"Liked this nozzle so much, bought one for the backyard hose too. Feels like good quality, doesn't leak at all. I can leave the hoses turned on and I don't lose a drop of water anywhere."
5.0,Rugged construction.  It works perfectly and has survived NY winters.  It has a comfortable handle and delivers good water pressure across a range of settings.
5.0,This nozzle could solve world water problems. If only they provided this nozzle to everyone. The Bill Gates Foundation needs to know about the clean and delicious water that this produces.
4.0,"1. Good nozzle, fits most hose
2. Good amount of variations for stream and spray
3. A bit heavy, have 2 cars that I need to wash so hands get a bit tired by the time I am done."
5.0,Basic old school garden hose nozzle that does not break.  One commenter complained about the lead in the brass.  Without continuous flow or standing water the leeching potential for what lead is there is miniscule.
5.0,"I lost count of how many hose nozzles I bought and eventually tossed because of leaks, broken handles, broken pins, bad connections...etc., etc., etc.  Based on positive reviews here I finally gave in and took a chance on this ""old school"" looking nozzle (reminds me of using the hose when I was a kid).

It's very sturdy feeling, if not industrial looking.  Twisted onto my house easily and worked PERFECTLY!  NO leaks.  IMMEDIATE shut off.  IMMEDIATE spray.  What's old is new again!  Great nozzle.  I'll never go back to one of those ""fancy - 10 spray style"" plastic nozzles.  Never."
5.0,Excellent!!! I love it!!!The quality very good and I need it for my job! I like this items very much!!!
5.0,"I've used this pistol grip nozzle for years, and this product continues on and on for me.  Was very happy to see that they are offered here at Amazon.  Using the tension in your hand grip, one can water any type of plant.

I have told all of my gardening pals about it too."
5.0,"Gives your hand a slight workout, but wow - you don't get wet, it never drips, and it reaches extremely far so I don't have to move nearly as much when watering my large yard. Excellent!"
1.0,I was swayed by the reviews.  I am really disappointed with this product.  It is not made of hardened steel.  The cutting blade bends easily and the other blade was easily notched.  I have used this product with great anticipation that it was a strong and quality tough tool.  It is not. I can not recommend this product to anyone.  I was expecting it to be hardened sword quality steel.  Foolish me.
5.0,Great price for a garden shear
4.0,Great shears
4.0,They came on time and are easy to use and sturdy.
4.0,"I fell for the ""lasts 3x longer"" and ""3x sharper"" hype, in hopes that someone is telling the truth.  These are nice, sharp shears.  I'd give them five stars, except that sometimes they stick shut while you're trying to get a large bush trimmed in a hurry.  I find that annoying.  A minor issue--the ""soft"" grip wasn't very soft."
5.0,Fiscars are always great.  Have used them for years and will continue to do so.  Have had some of them for YEARS!
5.0,"These pruning shears are excellent!  I already had a pair, but they were getting a bit dull after several years. So I ordered one from Amazon. The first one I ordered had a loose handle, but I returned it to Amazon, and got a prompt replacement within a week.  I have arthritis in my hands and appreciate the soft padded handles. Hopefully they will last as long as my original ones.  I have always been very satisfied with Fiskars products -- sewing scissors, paper-cutting scissors, you name it.  They last for ever."
5.0,I use it to cut flowers for bouquets. Sometimes there are small branches in the bouquets and it does a great job cutting all of it with minimal effort.
4.0,"nice and sharp. could be a little better design for easier use, but good product"
5.0,"Great price, fast shipping and easy to use!"
5.0,"This sprayer is awesome. It delivers a very strong stream and is easy to use- even my 3 year old can use it!  The metal is a nice, heavy material and it comes with a tab that you can use to leave it on and not have to continue squeezing the handle. Perfect sprayer!"
5.0,"As expected, this is a solid unit.  All metal and seemingly built to last.  Stream is perfect so far.  I can get the power and focus that I was looking for.  Good value.  No leaks so far.

Update on 8/19/16:  I have five of these now and all continue to would well.  None have shown the degradation that I have seen in the plastic units I still own."
5.0,I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.
5.0,these are German Shepard proof - the dog has broken all nozzles but these.  I guess they are good for the garden but I bought them for the dog.
5.0,"Great for hosing down the yard and misting/fan spraying plants. For people who forget to turn the water off, this can be a very efficient way to automaticly shut off the water when not using it."
4.0,"Works well as advertised.  Good pressure and much better at changing the flow style than the type with the ""flow setting dial"" on the nozzle.  Feels like it will last for several seasons.  Grip could be a little more comfortable in the hand.  If I had to do over, I would have bought the same one, but with a rubberized grip."
5.0,"""Great Pistol Grip Action, comfortable and sturdy! Get the one with threads on the front so to add attachments.. great Company and Quality."
5.0,I bought one of these maybe a month or so ago along with a new hose. I haven't had any problems with this nozzle and it works great for around the yard. I liked it so much I bought two more of these nozzles and two more hoses for the other areas around the yard so I don't have to constantly undo it and move it around. Would highly recommend this gilmour nozzle and for the price you can't go wrong.
4.0,I kinda expected a little more but for the price i am not really complaining it gets the job done
4.0,"Pretty good sprayer for the price, seems a little light & made in China (of course). I do think it should hold up a while considering I don't use it a lot- we'll see, it does works pretty well though."
4.0,Not the most comfortable pair of shears but they work well.
5.0,"I got these shears because I needed something a little more heavy duty than kitchen shears to trim my potted lemon and lime trees.  I snipped some 1/2"" branches and they worked great.  The blades are sharp and I didn't need to exert too much pressure.  I then tried to cut some dead palm frond ribs off my 4 ft palm tree and that's where these shears had a bit of trouble.  The stems were about a 1/4 inch thick and 1.25"" wide and I was able to still cut through them, but needed to apply quite a bit of pressure.  I wish I could cut through those stems too, but these shears never claimed to be more heavy duty.

Overall, I found the shears very comfortable to hold with a sturdy feel.  They are great value for the price.  On that note, the price of these shears seems to fluctuate in price.  If you're not in a rush, it might be worth leaving it in your cart for a few days to see how the price changes."
5.0,Great small toll to trim with. Price is right.
5.0,Really? It's a fiskars clipper.  What more do you want?  It works great......
1.0,"The edge rolled and was sheared off the first time it was used.  Unfortunately, it was not used within the 30 day return period, so I am stuck with a useless set of shears.  Wish there was some way to return or warranty this item."
5.0,Super product!
4.0,"Made of hardened metal, feels solid in your hand. Has just the right weight that won't tire your hands. Has very sharp cutting edges. It has a safety lock which keeps the cutting edge closed, which I liked, will prevent accidents. Felt that the cutting blade could be little bit longer."
5.0,"If the limb is less than 1"" in diameter, it's dead.  These things are unstoppable.  The guy in ""Army of Darkness"" should have had a fiskar brand tool on his hand instead of a chain saw..."
4.0,Work well.
5.0,Great quality at a fair price
3.0,"Good feel, decent construction. Kind of lost their edge quickly and it's hard to sharpen the blades. But they're better than the generic Ace Hardware crap I usually buy. Would purchase again."
5.0,"I received these today and already used them.  Great bypassing cutting and good for soft plant pruning.  I tried it on a couple of larger (1/2"") rose shoots and it did the job but it's not really made for pruning larger bushes.  Used on my lavender and various other plants and it did the job beautifully!

The handle is shaped very well with a nice ergo design and the comfort is just right - not as hard as wood and not plush (just right!)"
5.0,"Nice simple shears, cuts through branches with ease.  My mother loves them because she has arthritis in her hands and wrist and this product allows her to take care of her garden all year long.

Been using them for 6 months and still sharp."
5.0,"Cannot say much except these pruners work as they are suppose to do,"
5.0,Great garden sheers. Cut through fairly thick stems & so easy to operate.
3.0,"It's ok, needs a bit larger of a cutting diameter."
5.0,Ultra handy now that the bushes have started growing out of control.
5.0,Great pair of shears!
1.0,"The hinge sticks, making this pruner difficult to use. The blades are not very sharp.  All in all, I do not recommend this item."
2.0,"These are NOT sharp enough to cut even small rose stems. Instead, they tear rather than cut through I'm disappointed. I've always owned Fiskars bypass pruners; I bought these due to the low price but can't use them. My purchase price was refunded and Amazon told me to not bother sending them back."
5.0,"We'd been through countless of the ""super duper"" plastic 876 position nozzles over the years and decided to scrap every dripping, leaking, clogged one of them in favor of simplicity. Guess what? It's a hose nozzle that doesn't leak or spray you as well as your target. How 'bout that?! They're not as good as the one's we used back in the 70's, but for today's standards where we're importing top-dollar garbage, it's refreshing to find something that actually works as intended at a reasonable price."
5.0,"The title says it all. This nozzle was designed to be strong and long lasting. It's made of all metal and is very sturdy. The spray is surprisingly long. I can spray far distances without dragging the hose all over the place. You can either spray in a steady stream or in varying degrees of radius' depending on how much you let go of the nozzle. One criticism that might come up is that this product does not know gentle or have varying types of flows, and that's just fine as that is not what it was designed to do. But if you learn a few techniques like giving some distance and or showering back and forth, and trying out different angles you'll find it does all that you'll need it to do."
5.0,This is a very nice hose nozzle that is a quality product. It is much better than what you get at those big home store chains. No cheapo plastic here. One reviewer stated that this item contains lead. BIG DEAL....Everything nowadays contains something that MAY be harmful to humans including the air we breathe and the water we drink. I don't think the alleged amount of lead in this nozzle would harm an ant. I'll risk my life and water my plants and wash my cars with this nozzle and not concern myself with such NONSENSE.......
4.0,"If what you want is a durable nozzle at a cheap price that allows you some ability to control the output of water, this is a good choice.

The nozzle itself feels like solid metal that will last for a while. It's also quite functional. The harder you squeeze the nozzle, the narrower (and more powerful) the spray. This allows you to use a light, dispersed spray to water the yard or a stronger spray for washing a car. For $5 or so, this is a good pickup."
5.0,I was tired of plastic models that worked well for a while but then seemed to deteriorate in quality.  I've only used this once since I got it but it seems to be solidly built and provides anywhere between a nice powerful stream and an airy spray.
1.0,"Nowhere in the product description did they say the brass in the nozzle (which comes in contact with the water) contains lead. It didn't need to contain lead although.  The packaging does say, after the fact when I've received the item.  It's too cheap to waste the time to return it.  Try something else that doesn't contain lead.
[...]"
5.0,"Works perfectly.  Variable spray (not sure why others had issues)  Never had a plastic one last more than a year, so being metal, I'm optimistic this could last a few years.

Water volume seemed more than adequate also."
5.0,"This old faithful sprayer works better than any of the new stuff.  They can come out with all kinds of new gadgets to put on your hose, but they always end up breaking and won't work.  this one is almost in destructable."
4.0,This nozzle sprayer is just basic but iy does a really good job of doing what it was designed to do. It is areally nice product for the low price. It is just what I needed.
5.0,"This is an excellent piece of equipment and I would highly recommend it. Good quality, not a single piece of plastic."
1.0,"There are much better choices at a lower cost. The padded handle covers slide off easily making the product much more difficult to use, and the although the cutting blades are sharp, they won't cut cut through larger branches without bending them out of shape. Nice try Fiskars, but it should be back to the drawing boards!"
5.0,"Great Quality!  found it cheaper a store.  On sale .
I love how the handle has a curve.  It exceeded my expectations."
4.0,Wish they made thee rust proof for tho of us who don't know to bring our tools in from the rain.
2.0,"Generally, I have good experience with Fiskars pruners of different size but there is something fishy with this particular model or lot. The shear's blades come out of the alignment and it is diffiucult to adjust them back."
2.0,"In my case, ""light"" duty meant they bent within the first 20 minutes.  I used them on a green tree branch of approximately max width (4-5/8"") and the blades separated sideways causing the pruner to twist in my hand.  This force caused the back bar (ie: not the sharp blade but the piece it cuts against) to bend outward.  I used a rock to press against and bend it back to continue cutting more branches but this happened a couple times and I gave up.  If your 'light' duty means you'll only ever cut fairly soft and small things, these may work for you.  But I doubt it.  Eventually, your're going to attempt something stiff and they're going to bend."
5.0,"These are great. I had previously been pruning my plants with a pair of seamstress shears. Which was a pain because some of my tomatoes get really thick stalks. These made short work of that. I also tested them on an overhanging tree branch about thickness of my index finger, which isn't really what these are made for and it cut right through it. All in all I can say these are perfect for any colored thumb level from brown to green."
5.0,k
4.0,"These are great trimmers. Bought a pair just like these 5 years ago, they are still going strong. Bought this pair to keep in the back yard."
5.0,A+++
5.0,"Great for yard work, bush trimming, weed removal etc."
5.0,"No issues with this product.  Arrived on-time and works great!  Product is not stainless like I expected (but that's because I cant read), its zinc which seems to be very good quality.  Adjust spray just by amount of grip- great for both watering lawn as well as washing cars. Hope to have this product for a long time to come"
5.0,"With all the tricked out, overblown, synthetic, whiz bang crap on the market, this is still the all around best design along with long lasting METAL.  I have one that is at least 30 years old.  The best part? you can operate it mostly with one hand.  Who thinks it is a good idea to put those fussy little PLASTIC on/off levers on things????. some are so small they are  hard to pinch and stiff to turn especially if you have grip issues.  This one you just release the handle lever and it stops.. no muss no fuss.  You can put it down without having to twist and/or struggle to turn it off.  It is ready to spray again with simple hand pressure .. again .. no wrestling or twisting required.

Most all tarted up stuff today must be designed by people who never have to use the item..  A good, simple idea is always a good simple idea."
4.0,"There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.

That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair."
4.0,"Why can't we even manufacture hose nozzles here in the USA anymore? Ugh...  Anyway, pistol grip nozzle product is just as advertised; the stream helps extend the watering reach of my hose."
5.0,"Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get ""prettier"" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if ""pretty"" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.

THUMB SCREW
Note the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.

LOCK-ON LOOP
Notice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a ""lock on"" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.

NOT A VALVE
One reviewer complains that there is no ""medium"" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual ""problem"", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is ""too good""---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a ""closed"" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melnor-390S-Hose-Shut-Off/dp/B00004SDYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melnor 390S Hose Shut-Off</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-Brass-Garden-Hose-Connector-With-Shut-Off-Valve-03V/dp/B0006U66B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03V</a>&nbsp;just before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then ""open 'er up"" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.

COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERS
Many reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT ""Gilmour 572TF"".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in ""bargain bin"" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a ""Gilmour 572TF"", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the ""Gilmour 572TF"", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.

CAVEATS
Here in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hose&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Permatex-22058-Dielectric-Tune-up-Grease-3-oz/dp/B000AL8VD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.</a>&nbsp;If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.

Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)

After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.

But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.

NERD CORNER
The zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will ""sacrifice"" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).

What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) ""pretty"" sprayer nozzles, which have ""fallen out of favor"" for various reasons.

5.0,"There are lots of fancy nozzles out there.  This one is basic and does the job.  Plus, being all-metal should make it more durable than the plastic ones."
5.0,"I got this because the plastic nozzles that I find in the stores constantly break or are hard to adjust the flow.  This is entirely metal and is made with good quality.  It doesn't require you to turn the head of the nozzle to adjust the spray pattern and puts out a powerful stream.
The hand grip is a little thin and has no padding so if you are going to be using this for long periods of time I would suggest a different nozzle but for normal usage, like washing a car, this one is great."
4.0,"If you check my reviews you'll see I've been on a quest for a decent sprayer gun/wand for years.

Exhausted with that, I finally bought these because they weren't PLASTIC, and they look like the
sprayer my grandparents used for 50 years.

Voila - I am happy to report these (I got 2) work great.

Only flaw: when I go to fill a bucket, etc. there is no ""medium"" strength - it's either a wide
mist or a super-cannon.

Otherwise, terrific."
5.0,"I've had it about a week.  It's a very good nozzle!  Well made, seems durable.  I really like it so far!"
5.0,"I bought this nozzle based on all the reviews I read about it. And I must say, they were right on. This nozzle is the BEST. I can water my whole garden without moving from one spot. You adjust the spray by the amount of pressure you hold on the pistol. No twisting and turning to get the right spray. Best of all, it doesn't leak. I love it."
5.0,"Love these pruning shears. Now I prune with ease and comfort. They are sturdy too. I couldn't put them down I enjoyed them so much. Will probably order another pair just in case.
Thanks"
5.0,Works Very Well
5.0,Good shears and a good price!
5.0,durable
1.0,"I've had two of the Fiskars Traditional Bypass Pruners, and they both have malfunctioned in the same way, and both within just a month or less of lighter-duty pruning. As someone who is not a master gardener, and someone who was going by the Fiskars brand name alone (we have multiple pairs of Fiskars scissors and love them), I thought these would be the easiest to use and most versatile. Not so. When twigs or branches are even the least bit wet (read: alive), the pruner blades separate on the cut and make a mess of the branch. Debris gets caught up in the housing that conceals the spring mechanism and is very difficult to remove. These pruners were not made to be taken apart, cleaned, and/or sharpened, and that is a *major* drawback.

Were I to do it over again, I would have spent the money I did on these pruners and purchased either Felco or even Corona."
5.0,Arrived almost immediately.  Exceeds all expectations.  I really like it.  Foskars is the BEST.
5.0,"this is the best pruning shears I have ever owned, very sharp, work great."
4.0,Ok
5.0,Bypass pruners are a must around our yard.  Fiskars are the best.
5.0,Much lower price than my local store. Good quality
5.0,Great pruning shears and easy even on hands with significant arthritis.
5.0,After struggling with generic clippers I wized up and got these killers. Takes very little effort to lop off pretty large branches. A great buy!
5.0,"Nice shears, and very sharp."
4.0,"This is a good pruning shears from Fiskars. Its fully hardened, precision-ground steel blade stays sharp, even through heavy use."
5.0,"Have used only briefly so far, but the shears did work well for the chore I had.  They appear to be well made and should be durable."
4.0,handy little dudes . helps me get the job done fast
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"This is a well made product. If you a new gardener like me, just go for it. I believe it is a great product for those experienced ones too considering all the other reviews."
3.0,"This is my second order due to losing the first one, which was a wonderful tool. I was so disappointed at losing and missed it terribly.  I ordered a replacement which was terrible and nothing at all like my first. It felt light and didn't cut well. The button was also loose and made it difficult to keep closed. I returned it and bought another one that arrived with a chip in the blade. What?! I requested one last replacement and it is perfect. It is identical in quality and heft to my original purchase - the one I lost. I am so happy to have one again, and one that works. Shouldn't have taken three tries to get a good one, but at least I have it now. Love these shears and use them every day, along with when I mow. There's no other similar tool that I've found and don't want to lose this one, ever, ever, ever."
2.0,they often just crush the stem or don't cut all the way through & i couldn't loosen the anvil adjusting screw.
5.0,The pruning shears are comfortable to hold and work very efficiently. I would highly recommend them.
4.0,"Nice, smooth cuts on bushes and stalks."
5.0,Love them
1.0,"The handles don't pop back open after making a cut.  I've cleaned this tool after every use, tried 3-in-1 oil & WD-40 but still have to manually open the handles every time.  Worthless!"
5.0,The shears have sharp blades and a safety catch for storing.
4.0,Ordered as replacement pruner.  like the locking mechanism.  Only down side is the spring action for opening has reduced in efficiency with use in short time.  Overall still good quality.
2.0,"The locking mechanism becomes loose after use, and becomes locked when your using them. This in my opinion is counter productive, other than that the blade and handles feel and work good. I would not recommend them to a friend."
2.0,"I only made one cut on a quarter inch branch and couldn't make another cut. The shears would not close. Upon inspection the cutting blade nicked opposing blade and left a gouge with a sharp burr. The nick caused the cutting action to stop half way making it inoperable and would not 'spring' back in the open position.
This was my first return to Amazon.
They refunded me and supplied the return mailing.
Very pleased with the service.
Sorry the product didn't work out."
5.0,Allows me to cut thick stems and branches. the blade is really sharp!
5.0,I wore my other one out. I have a long handled one but sometimes I have to trim in restricted spaces. I'll give this one a good work out.
1.0,Handles don't last. Two replacements in a row had misaligned blades. Gave up and bought the 9124.
5.0,"This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I lost the first one somewhere. I owned the first one for 15 years and there has been virtually no wear.  I dismantle it periodically and sharpen the blade and grease the joints.  This depends upon how much you use it.  It's my ""go-to"" tool I carry in my back pocket

The good news is that it's been slightly improved (you could not tell the difference in performance in spite of what the manufacturer states). The bad news is so slight you can't tell the difference but the price is about 30% higher.  It's Swedish made so part of the increase is the demise of the dollars decline vs European states."
5.0,Ffvg
5.0,Great pair of snips!
5.0,I love how comfortable the handles feel in my hand. They require very little effort to use. The blades are very sharp. I like that they lock closed to prevent injury. That makes me feel more confident  about putting them in my pants or apron pockets when I need both hands free.
4.0,Sharp and does the job very well.
5.0,comfortable and very sharp
5.0,arrived as promised.
5.0,Best product I have ever used.
5.0,I cut a tree down by the roots with this thing.
5.0,Sharp and very reliable.
5.0,Works as intended
4.0,Works as expected.  Good price
1.0,Poor.  Jammed five weeks after purchase.
4.0,Very nice
5.0,Stick with the Fiskars!  Just used it for 3 hours and no problems!
5.0,The usual good quality of Fiskars products.
1.0,"This Shear is a piece of junk.  I have been using Pruning Shears for over 40 years.  These are probably the cheapest made shears I have ever used.  The only good thing I can say is that Amazon gives back your money no questions asked.
For starters the blades are not hardened steel as stated.  The first time out the box I tried to cut green suckers off my Lilac tree.  The branches were about 1/2 inch in diameter.  The blade edge folded over on itself.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  I know lilac is hard wood but these suckers are green.  I have never seen any blade do this, not even the cheapest ones.  Unless your cutting something like celery, I would stay away from this.
I would give these shears zero stars if I could.  This was a big waist of my time.  I can't imagine why they have such a high rating.  It was for this reason I ended up purchasing this junk.  Perhaps my review will help save someone else the time wasted."
4.0,"The blades is very good quality, but unfolding does not quickly."
3.0,"They're alright, but nothing special.  I've used better...  I do find I like the ratchet type of clippers much better.  Way more cutting power."
5.0,It works cheaper than Lowes even with tax.
1.0,Awful. Just awful. Broke in first ten minutes of use.
5.0,Nice and sharp and comfortable in the hand.
1.0,"Cutting blade bent after 10 minutes of use, and will not close. Cheap steel. Get what you pay for. Go with a higher end pair."
4.0,feels good in your hands and gets the job done.
5.0,Excellent quality for the price!
5.0,They work great. A little hard to pop open after pruning but sharp and durable.
5.0,"I love my Fiskars.  I also have their 32"" lopper for bigger cutting jobs."
2.0,"Every time I cut a branch I would have to stop and physically unlock the safety lock.  It was so loose after a month (after the 30 day return policy), that it is more frustrating to use than to let my plants go crazy.  It is even more frustrating because these could be an EXCELLENT Pruning Shears!  They are very sharp, and the grip is padded and very comfortable.but essentially, useless as it takes three times as long to do the job!"
5.0,Very handy. I especially like the trigger feature that lets me easily lock and unlock the shears. I had one and loved it so much I bought a second pair.
1.0,very dissapointed  they don't cut very well
1.0,"Very disappointed.  The button which controls the cutting position sticks. Thereby making it very cumbersome and difficult to use.  After each
clipping it must be slid upward,,which is difficult because it freezes, resulting in sore fingers and broken fingernails.  I had depended on the
FISKARS reputation for a dependable product."
2.0,I had these for a few years and they cut fine but the handles came loose and kept sliding off.  I tried gluing them but it didn't last for very long.
4.0,Does the job. Sharp
5.0,WORKS GREAT
5.0,These are SHEARLY the best!  Sorry.
5.0,These are pretty powerful
1.0,"Disappointed with these, they metal on the blade wrinkled on my first cut. It works ok ever since but not impressed."
1.0,Blades don't mesh 75% of the time making simple cuts impossible.  Bought the brand with confidence but find the product subpar.  Want to return it.
5.0,Excellent product
5.0,"I have been able to cut through 2"" thick branches.  these shears are strong!"
4.0,"Useful and pretty sharp.  I like pruning shears for almost anything I can reach.  I sometimes get them stuck in branches that are really too thick for them and require a saw.  I usually just back them up with a bit of difficulty, bend the branch and get at the remaining wood that way.  I do not recommend that because, at some point, they may not come out of the branch.

These are to replace my very favorite Scott's which I had for years and years until they were borrowed and never returned.  Sigh.  Those lasted, without much upkeep, for years and remained strong and sharp.  I could not find the same item so I thought I would give these a try.

They seem to work fine although only time and heavy use will tell how durable they are.  I think every gardener needs a pair of these or something like them in the kit."
5.0,Works well
5.0,GOOD TOOL TO HAVE
5.0,The pruning shears work perfectly! I am so glad I got them!! With 3 dozen fruit trees that need pruning these work perfectly in keeping everything trimmed back and neat.
4.0,"These were just delivered so I went out to trim some bushes in the yard. Nice and sharp. Comfortable grips. Easy to use locking. Seem fine for light duty trimming. Obviously I can't speak to durability, but Fiskars have always held up well for me."
5.0,Nice
5.0,Great pruning shears. Great price
5.0,"Like them, together we get the job done"
5.0,"Sharp, awesome."
5.0,"In my experience, most of the shears I've used hurt my hand because of its poor ergonomics. This is one is very easy on the palms."
3.0,"They work well, but the blades tend to get stuck. The sole purpose of our purchase was to cut our rose stems. Good investment, we'll see in a month or so."
5.0,"very nice quality, smooth"
5.0,Feel this is good quality for the price
5.0,It's hard to beat Fiskars stuff
5.0,Great
5.0,Clip with ease and go right thru the small branches.
4.0,I like the design and functionality but the blades dull rather quickly.
5.0,"These were a stocking stuffer and they were perfect. They work well for weeds, bushes, and small tree branches. They seem to be good quality and the price was certainly right."
4.0,"it can pruning powerfully.
 I also find out it can also cut it laterally and thinly if you want to unplug the raindrip from pipe and use it late on"
5.0,"Yes Fiskars Brand anything are indeed a little over priced. The question that I felt needed answering was ""Is it truly worth the extra $5.00 over the no-name brand"" I believe so. I am a tight wad for sure, however we are hard on our gardening tools (We have 16 30x60 gardens) and are always willing to spend that little extra on any Fiskars brand as they truly are worth the extra cash every time. These pruners are always within arms reach. I absolutely love them for pruning. I've even used them on small trees and they keep on truckin threw."
5.0,Yup. Does what it should. Lock slides in and out of place easily enough.
5.0,"Picked these up at a local store to prune my dwarf orange tree. These things are amazing, well built, easy to use.
Smooth clean cuts every time."
5.0,"Nice and sharp, does the job."
5.0,"Spot on, cut excellently, would buy again."
5.0,I have carpal tunnel and these pruning shears make pruning easy to do. My husband also uses these for small branches. It's very easy to use and the grips are comfortable.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,I love it! It's very useful and cut easily.
5.0,perfect pruners for garden
4.0,work great
1.0,The bolts don't keep the blades together.  I used these shears for the first time and was sorely sad I purchased them.
5.0,sharp
5.0,Trusted  brand  long  term  use
4.0,Great power in such a little tool.
5.0,I bought these shears because of my past experience with Fiskars products and I was not disappointed.  Living in FL I am forever having to prune the bushes or they will overtake the entire yard. I literally use these at least 3 times a week and they are still going strong over a year later. I am able to prune some pretty thick crepe myrtle branches with no hesitation and then go for the rose bushes with ease. I have used many other brand name pruning shears but none of them have lasted like this pair by Fiskars. I think I will have these for many years to come.
2.0,not sharp enough
5.0,Bought from my local Lowe's. This item works better than most in its class and price range. Requires less effort to cut some of the thicker limbs. Blade has stayed sharp for over a year and it did not rust as some of the others did.
1.0,"These are awful - complete garbage!  As soon as I opened them, they never closed again completely and the blade gouged itself on the other side of the trimmers, ruining the edge which wasn't particularly sharp to begin with.  I tried trimming one small branch with them and they left a jagged, incomplete cut.  Would not recommend!"
5.0,These shears greatly helped me reduce the volume of a very annoying rose of sharon bush in my front yard.  Thank you Fiskars.
5.0,these are the shears you're looking for
2.0,"We are used to excellent products from Fiskars, but this one is not well-designed. In its first use, cutting off small pencil-sized suckers from a fruit tree, the blade and guard did not line up, and the blade caught on and was nicked by the lower guard, ruining the sharp edge. From time to time they seem to misalign themselves (even just opening and closing them without anything between), which causes the blade to catch on the guard and malfunction. The only positive is that the handles are easy to grip and not hard to close. We definitely won't be buying these again, they just aren't well-designed or well-made."
2.0,Maybe I got a bad lot. Maybe quality has declined. I had to replace my old clippers and so I bought these. They are not strong enough to cut through simple thin branches. The metal actually twisted. Disappointing.
5.0,"I love these pruning shears.  They work really well and they are fast and efficient, even with small-sized branches.  You should clean them after every use, otherwise it can get a little gummy on the blades.  They are my go-to shears."
1.0,The cutting blade was damaged after a few minutes of use. They will no longer cut anything. I was only trimming a small rose bush and now the blade is chipped and curled over in several places. it will no longer cut anything and the metal is bent and peeling off along the blade edge. These are junk.
5.0,"I've tried other pruners, and these are my favorite. I bought a second pair to replace others that just didn't hold up."
5.0,"Sturdy, easy on hands, works well!"
5.0,Great product.  Arrived quickly.  As advertised.  Thanks!!
2.0,Honestly I didn't Buy these from Amazon but I'm not pleased at all. They are fine for larger pieces bit won't work at all for small fine leaves or stems. Wish I would have saved my receipt because they'd be going back.....
5.0,They cut great.  wish I had gotten two pairs
5.0,Love these little Pruning Shears.  The rubber handles make them easy to hold and manuver.  Great cutting edge.
5.0,"got this ones to replace mi wood handles one, so far so good, it works fine to dig pole holes."
5.0,The post hole digger was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted one that was alot sturdier than what they sell at Home Depot or Lowe's.  This fit the bill.
5.0,"This did a super job for me. This post hole digger was strong enough to break through the soil without me having to loosen the dirt first. When I reached clay it continued to cut through allowing for a clean hole, I only had one hole to dig so my review is from this perspective. It is a sturdy tool and I believe would last through many a dig."
5.0,"This Seymour Post Hole Digger is well made and works great. We (and by ""we"" I mean my son) are using this to put up a short fence in our yard and having the right tool makes the job that much easier.

The cushioned grip is easy on the hands, even without gloves, and the fiberglass handles reduces the weight over wooden handle versions. This makes a perfect hole for a 4""x4"" pressure treated post.

Highly Recommended!

5.0,very sharp
5.0,Good quality and sharp enough to trim the branches.
5.0,Just the right size for trimming my small yard. Very pleased.
5.0,There work great sharp and easy to use.
4.0,Got this pruning shears for my wife's gardening tools.
5.0,This pruning shear is exactly what I wanted. Job well done. Thanks.
5.0,sturdy and and very nicely formed for the hand. easy to snip with
3.0,"It is ok product. Not that sharp enough than I have expected. When you cut a hard stem of flower, it doesn't cut clearly. It leaves some parts. That is a problem."
4.0,Great pruning shears even a retired English footballer would appreciate! Works wonders trimming back plants and cutting twigs. Good quality and easy to use.
5.0,Good for Light Duty Cutting
1.0,Same thing as the other one use it once and went too you could not cut anything I dislike both of them
5.0,easy to use
5.0,Love these! Was able to cut down a 2 inch diameter tree with little effort. Grips are comfortable and I'm sad I didn't order them sooner.
3.0,"Decent pruning shears,  but slightly cheap feeling.  The opening spring is quite weak, and didn't consistently open the shears all of the way.  They don't quite meet the quality expectations I usually have for Fishers."
4.0,Nice shears
2.0,it would of been nicer and cheaper for the price to go to home depot
3.0,First item received was defective. Received a replacement before I even sent back the defective one. Amazon return/replacement process worked great. Do not try to cut more than the clippers can handle. I repeatedly cut hard and as big of branches as I can with these and they no longer work as well as when they were new. I seem to have worn them out.
2.0,"I read several positive reviews for a variety of Fiskar's products so I was quite surprised at the performance (or lack thereof) of these shears.  On one side of my yard there is a chain link fence that has had, over the years, various vines, saplings, thorns and other plants grow up intertwining themselves through the links.  I bought these to use to cut away at them and clear the fence.

At first, they worked fine.  The grip feels good in my hands (I do wear gloves when I use them) and the blade fits nicely through the fence and is easy to direct.  I used them for 3 to 4 hours on one weekend and for another hour the following.  By the end of what would be the 5th hour of use, the blades were so dull I can no longer cut cleanly through a 1/4"" stem.  Now, I was only using them on small (less than 3/4"") plants as described -- never roots, never in the soil.

They were good while the edge lasted but I feel they should go more than 5 hours of use before needing sharpening."
5.0,"This is my first pair of pruners, but they work really great. They cut super easily, and have a little bolt in the middle above the handle where you can slide it up and down to unlock and lock the pruners closed. Seem to be very durable and I anticipate them to hold up very well for years to come."
5.0,"good,sharp"
5.0,"A Gardner's best friend. These things seldom leave my hands when I am out there! I have had them for over 5 years and they are still good as ever. No rust, no wear and tear. I have had to replace other printers after one or two years, but these have survived a lot of rough treatment and daily use."
5.0,Fiskars never disappoints me.  These are very good pruning shears and will cut through way thicker stuff than I imagined.
5.0,Very well made Pruning Shears.
5.0,Great
5.0,Cuts quickly and easily.  Will probably buy another pair for my Dad.
5.0,Solid product. So far very happy
4.0,"These are a bit stiff - not easy for old hands, but they cut well and are strong."
5.0,Great price and product.
5.0,"I was very surprised by the durability and strength these little shears have. I was able to cut through items at least a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick with no problem. We just purchased a house so these came in handy in pruning back many things that had become overgrown. Seem to be holding up well, but would definitely repurchase if needed!"
5.0,Fiskars are hands down the best gardening tools to buy. I have several pairs.
5.0,love these they are the best
5.0,good value
5.0,"Sturdy and effective. It cuts with no problem through 1"" branches. Great quality."
5.0,Excellent shears. Been extremely pleased with all my Fiskars purchases.
5.0,Works great. Comfortable fit. Easy to release blade lock form either side. Nice clean cuts and I expect it to last a long time
1.0,This thing bent while cutting a 0.5 inch branch from an apple tree and never recovered-into the trash.
2.0,They got VERY dull VERY fast. .Only used them a couple times.  I thought i was getting a good deal. Then I saw this same thing a Bog lots with 2 in a package for less than I paid for this 1.
5.0,Product is great and arrived fast
5.0,"Well built, strong, exceptional grips, can handle a very sizable cut if you have the muscles"
5.0,"Sharp, all metal construction is great - seems stronger than an older, plastic pair."
5.0,Given as part of a bridal shower gift.  Looks great
5.0,This is my 2nd pair of these pruners. I use them hard and the first pair lasted a long time - 6 years! The blade dulled slowly and the handle is what finally broke. I've already used this new pair and they're just as great as the first set!
5.0,Replacing a much used pair.
3.0,"Had problems with the blades ""sticking"" That is, it would not open and closed easily. Contacted Fiskars and they sent a new unit which works well, so far."
5.0,Great item; will buy again.
4.0,Easy on the hands!
5.0,Works well and the price was good.
5.0,Nice large grips.  Haven't tried them yet.  Will keep you updated.
5.0,Work  great - even on larger tuff stems on my roses.
5.0,HUSBAND LOVES THESE NIPPERS!
5.0,"Good product, well made."
4.0,"Not Japanese quality, but OK for the average person. Professionals should buy higher quality..."
4.0,It is a Fiskars--it has to be good.
5.0,Nice
5.0,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, sharp pruining shears that are comfortable to use."
5.0,Great price for a quality product.
5.0,Great Product!!
4.0,the price was good
5.0,Great product.made very well.
5.0,Works well for the rose bushes.
5.0,"I got one of these for a friend because I've had one for several years and they continue to function as my ""go to"" clippers."
1.0,Super dull.  Didn't cut well.  Returned to seller.
5.0,"This shears works so well. They are so sharp so cutting shurbs and stems is very easy, especially with comfortable grip. It's very well made and sturdy. We've had it for 5 years now. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Good
5.0,They fity hand perfectly.
5.0,perfect for my pruning needs
4.0,Good
1.0,"The blade on these chipped on the third branch I cut with them. While they still cut branches, the chip in the blade prevents the shears from automatically opening so you have to push them open each time with your fingers.

I'd personally recommend something more durable."
5.0,I love this pruning shears for my roses.  The handle is comfortable and the cut is very good.
3.0,Seems average quality. Had some trouble cutting smoothly while pruning roses. Thought it would be better because of the brand name. I would not purchase these again.
5.0,Got this with the Fiskars 25-33 in hedge shear....love it!
3.0,Agree with other comments that these won't easily cut anything beyond 1/2 inch or so. I also bought an EZY ratcheting pruner and it cuts much more effectively (but was also over twice the price).
1.0,"These are absolute rubbish. I long since replaced them with another brand, but when I saw these on Amazon I had to share my experience. First and foremost, I am a Fiskars fan, and have been for a while. I adore their genuine Finnish made products, especially their famous orange handled scissors for crafts/sewing/indoor stuff (which, once upon a time, were made in Finland with steel brought in from Sweden), but also their garden related products. Unfortunately, many years back, Fiskars became a global importer and ceased all manufacturing in Finland. Typically you can only find old stock from the made-in-Finland days, otherwise it's just new, made-in-China junk.

These bypass pruning shears, a newer product offering that was only ever made in China, is a case in point. Their quality is pitiful, especially given the relatively high price point compared to other China junk. The blade is garbage and cuts like you'd expect from poorly made-in-China pruners, i.e. not very well if at all. They jam up constantly, even on light duty jobs, because they are neither polished nor coated to prevent plant material from sticking to them and gumming up the hinge. Furthermore, the button mechanism to lock/unlock also constantly locks itself in the middle of being used, resulting in complete work stoppage to unlock it again. If you're wearing gloves appropriate to doing most yard work, this can be a real pain, because you need to remove them to wrestle with this stupid thing over and over when it locks itself for the umpteenth time.

It pains me as a Fiskars brand enthusiast to give a 1-star rating, but honestly, these are probably some of the worst pruners I have ever used. They're not sharp, they're not well made, they're not well engineered, they're not durable, the locking mechanism is poorly designed and executed, the ergonomics are nonexistent and the tool simply does not work for its intended purpose. This incredibly typical of made-in-China garbage riding on what used to be a high quality brand name. It's a shame that Fiskars sold out. I would not recommend this product at all, and certainly not at this price point. You're paying for a name that no longer has any connection the level of quality in the product. It's just import junk like everything else now."
5.0,Love Fiskars for all my outdoor tools.
3.0,The first one I was shipped was not assembled correctly. The blades did not line up so it actually cut into itself when I tried to close it. This lead to the cut getting deeper and finally the shears could only close halfway. Amazon shipped me another and I have no complaints with the second one.
5.0,perfect
4.0,"I love the shears, but they came used!"
5.0,"Bought these yrs. ago and work well on butterfly bushes but not as good as ARS brand that cuts thru woody 4 in. stems and still sharp for fine, fine work. Kept em but clunky, not quality hoped for. These r great IF you don't have many hrs. of work to do. For me, any spring loaded snips r prone to give me numbing in hands. I prefer the ARS brand, have collection of varied ARS snips and some decades old but oerform like those right out of the box. Better than other bonsai or botanicals snips, ARS brand stays super sharp and admit have no problems if cutting fine, fine manicure or thru that massive main stem. For all your oils, butters, tinctures, salves, lotions..use code for discount

Happy!"
5.0,Great shears at an even greater price.
5.0,V Good
5.0,Thanks!
5.0,Got these for my Mom as a gift and she uses them frequently.
5.0,Great sheers! Cut through my hedges for quick trimmings. Easy to lock and unlock. Excellent quality for the price.
5.0,These are replacements for my 20 year old shears.. Love them and hope they hold up as long as the others did..
5.0,"Work great, what else can you say about shears.  Solid build, cut everything that I need, perfect"
5.0,"I have used these to prune my very large indoor plants for 3 months now with no issues. The largest diameter is approximately 1/2"". Cuts through easily a cleanly."
3.0,plastic lock easily break.
5.0,"When I first began to garden, I purchased inexpensive tools..and repurchased them a few months later, had cutters fall apart on me..or not cut at all, basically after a couple of years I decided to spend more money on my tools for gardening..as an electrician I never skimped on my tools for work. Nothing but Kline snips for example-decided to treat myself the same at home.

I'm also a quilter and use nothing but Fiskars scissors, rotary cutters etc so when I discovered Fiskar gardening tools I was very pleased.

This is my 8th or 10th  purchase of these bypass pruners over the past 25 years.  I gave them as gifts to gardener friends, have gone thru 3 pair myself (almost 10 years..not bad!) and even fixed a pair that spent the winter in rain and snow..I found it when I was putting in a new garden!.

Moving into a new house on the same lot, I decided to reward myself with several new gardening tools...I have almost an acre to develop here in suburban Portland and these sheds are the best I've used for roses etc."
1.0,They broke the very first time I used them. Easy to return.
5.0,"Sharp, smooth, good grip. Quick lock within thumb reach. Will see how it lasts over time, but so far so good!
Mine has a small bump on one of the handles when it arrived, probably just a manufacturing defect, but wasn't worth the trouble returning/exchanging."
5.0,look fine!!! It will work thru the summer!!!
5.0,"These are excellent, and work exactly as described. I had other shears, but always go for these."
5.0,"These cut like butter, but of course they are still new."
5.0,I bought these as I'm doing the flowers for my daughter's wedding. The best way to cut roses so that they can hydrate is with a bypass type shear. These are strong and reliable. Recommend!
5.0,Perfect! Have them in my green house
5.0,A reliable product.
5.0,I love fiskar's products.  This company really stands by their tools.
5.0,a personal favorite in my garden. I wear it on my hip like a gun and use it when needed.
5.0,Works well and is made solid but you do need to use the right shear for the right branch diameter or any shear may fail you.
5.0,Great shears - old ones still work but time to semi- retire after 10 yrs
5.0,Love Fiskars. Great quality!
5.0,GAVE  THIS  AS  A  GIFT.
4.0,Good Quality
5.0,Fiskars are great and made with quality. I bought one of the bypass and one of the anvils for the different jobs around my property. I prefer the bypass because I can cut/prune bigger diameter branches with them. They padded handles are excellent and comfortable. They cut with ease and I've had no problem with them at all. I've used both (anvil and bypass) now for a whole season doing some pretty heavy duty pruning and cutting on the trails on my property and they work as advertised. I recommend Fiskars! I expect to have and use these for many years.
5.0,Yes
5.0,Works great!
5.0,Great price. Sharp too.
5.0,Works great
5.0,Does what I expected and is a good buy as far as I am concerned.
5.0,very sharp and wellmade
5.0,AOK!
5.0,I actually bought these to go in my metal detecting kit. I used them when digging in areas and I encounter a stubborn root. These work great for cutting roots and other similar size things. Judging by the other reviews and how old they are these shears have been around for a long time. I like the coating on the handles as it is not too soft/squishy but soft enough to be comfortable on the grip.
5.0,"My Dad and I each have a pair of these.  They work well and feel good in the hand.  When ever I visit him, we take turns with his pair.  For Christmas I got ""him"" and extra set so we don't have to share shears when we are sharing time in the garden."
4.0,nice
5.0,tried them on the Christmas tree... work great...
5.0,great
4.0,Great
5.0,Really like them
5.0,These clippers are perfect. Just bought these to replace my old ones. The Fiskars products are usually more comfortable to use.
4.0,They showed up on time and are quality made they just are a little difficult to use on stalks wider than 1/8 inch.
5.0,"As described.  Great pair of clippers, good price fast shipping.  AAA"
5.0,"Bypass feature equals EASY pruning, even with fairly stout branches.  Comfortable grip.  Nice and sharp.  Quality in workmanship."
5.0,As advertised!
5.0,These are great shears
5.0,Good quality -- loved the first shears so purchased another to have on hand.
5.0,E
5.0,"works great, cuts through stuff"
5.0,Fiskars has an excelllent reputation for pruning and cutting shears and these shears are no exception. Probably could have paid a little less but over time it will be minimal--meanwhile I have a very good product that stays sharp and does the job.
5.0,"Very nice and sturdy pruning shears.  Should last a long, long time.  Made very well to."
5.0,Very sharp and easy to use
5.0,Fiskars Bypass Shears. They have a great fell too them and are very sharp.
5.0,Work well for the price would buy again.
4.0,I like it but it is a bit heavy than others that I have used
3.0,sticks alot
3.0,Fiskar fan.  Good price.  Decent quality.  I don't do a lot of gardening so I don't need super high quality.  I have a few things I need to trim back a couple times a year and that's it.  I don't know how they would hold up with heavy use but they are just fine for me.  The only flaw is no loop for your wrist or hang them from in the garage.
4.0,"They work great! They're very light, compact and cut through the thicker branches great."
5.0,"Good.  Solid and strong, definitely get the job done!"
5.0,Works great and arrived fast. I do wish it had a strap so I could hang it places. I have bought this several times. I add a little colorful duct tape to handle to make it easier to find.
5.0,A very handy and useful pruner.
5.0,Well made
5.0,SUPER!!  I wish my hands held up better than these!  Bothered with Bi-laterlal Carpel Tunnel every night...but I love to garden & work in the yard so just keep on...  Would love to get the longer handled lopers as well...
5.0,Great addition to a gardener's collection--sharp and strong at a very light mass.
5.0,very good shears..
5.0,Great product
5.0,Cuts well.
5.0,these kick butt I trimmed the Christmas tree this yr with them
2.0,"Purchased two pairs of these little pruners to replace Fiskars that I had bought years ago.  The old ones were my favorites, lasted for ever.  Only opened one pair, and the quality I had always enjoyed from this brand was missing.  Either the springs were too weak to open the blades, or something else caused them to seize.  They would not function.  I chose to return them, and my money was refunded."
5.0,Excellent clippers for the garden. Fiskar does make great tools!
5.0,"quick delivery, everything very well, thank-you"
4.0,"As expected, very good product."
5.0,The best Fiskars I have purchased.  Works well and fits my hand well.
4.0,Best pruners you can buy
5.0,"Very pleased with delivery timing, packaging, price and product"
5.0,Great
5.0,Wonderful
5.0,Nice
5.0,Works great!
5.0,Nice pruning shears. I really like how they incorporated the lock button in the middle. It cut all my bush trims and branches with ease.
5.0,extremely sharp and strong shears.  Heavy duty for cutting back plants in the garden.  They make any job easier and they are reliable.  My wife uses them everytime she need to cut back her plants.  They are easy to handle and require very little effort to use.  Very sharp as are all of the Fiskar products
5.0,My Sis loves them!
5.0,"fast delivery, very good product, thanks"
5.0,You may want to buy two -- great tool!
2.0,"Every time I try to snip, the blades lock up. I then have to pull them apart and snip again.  Takes twice the time to do the job. Rather unsatisfied."
3.0,I was a bit saddened when i discovered that i had received this with a manufacturers defect on the anvil of the pruners. There was a bit of a warp on it towards the back where the larger part of the cutting blade meets the anvil to cut a section of branch. This tiny metal spur that was on the anvil is always in the way and is continually damaging the pruning blade with continuous use. I think they would work perfectly fine if i had not received them with this defect.
5.0,Good
5.0,Good quality and cut good. I got them so my brother-in-law can tend to my yard for me. What else is a brother-in-law good for.
5.0,I love this pruner as it easily cuts stems without a problem. Great price and durable.
3.0,Blades are not as sharp as expected with this brand of product.
5.0,Sharp and great for backyard gardening
5.0,Clip clip goes the garden
5.0,"Sharp, good clippers.  Good price."
5.0,Very good tool.. cuts very easy.
4.0,I am a dedicated Fiskars customer. These work very well and would recommend them!
5.0,"These are great, I have had a  lot of these. I buy one of these each year."
5.0,Perfect. This is the best brand.
4.0,"I have big hands and these were easy to use even with gloves on. Good grip and seemingly sharp, though the lock could be a little sturdier. Didn't take much for it to come unlocked on its own."
4.0,"very good cuttig, a little difficult to close."
5.0,nice and sharp - good basic clippers
5.0,"I am the sort of gardener who would rather buy inexpensive tools and then not feel too bad if they get left out in the yard. These are just right. Sharp, handy, well designed, and they last a fair length of time. A few sprays of WD40 along the way may be required to keep them moving well, but when they get dull they've done enough."
5.0,Sharp and easy to use . I like the catch to hold it closed
3.0,"Bought these to replace an older pair of Fiskars bypass shears. These cut just fine, but after squeezing they don't snap back to open position. Oil & WD40 didn't help any. Takes the fun out of pruning."
5.0,work very well. worth it!
5.0,"Have had these shears for several years now, blades are anodized black w/~1/8"" of 'sharpening' area on top blade that is easily sharpened w/crosscut rat tail file! Handles are wrapped in foam rubber for comfort! Takes smaller bites for smaller branches but when sharp, cut cleanly!
These are why I now prefer exclusively Fiskars products to keep my property trimmed! Sorry Amazon, did not buy them from you, but I promise, if they ever fail? Will buy my next pair from you!  "
5.0,I have arthritis and I can use them fine!
2.0,Worked great for a month or so then the spring broke mid summer while cutting spinach. Doubt that the warranty covers the spring but it seems to be the most important part of the tool.
4.0,"Everything I've had from Fiskars has been great, and this is no exception!"
5.0,Great shears!!
4.0,Definitely very good shears. Hubby loves it. Perfect for pruning roses and small stems.
5.0,They came on time and are easy to use and sturdy.
5.0,"As with Fiskars products, I really like this pruner."
5.0,Very good
5.0,Good
5.0,"Cuts the trimmed limbs very clean, easy to handle."
5.0,"These are very nice, sharp, and do the job."
3.0,"Got these as a free replacement from Fiskars when my last pruners broke after 2-3 years of service.  They are nice and heavy and feel nice and smooth when first using.  Pretty soon after I got a knick in the blade and a portion of the blade would no longer cut soft items and I'd have to move the cut area.  Then almost exactly one year after getting them the spring that makes the handles stay apart broke, making them unusable.  The good news is Fiskars warranty is great, but I'd prefer to pony up for something more long lasting."
4.0,They work nice.
5.0,Like!!
5.0,Exactly as described; quick shipping.
2.0,Fiskars products used to be higher quality but not so much today.  I bought these at HD and they are really bad.  The foam gribs come off nearly right away.  I know they are cheaply priced but are not even worth this amount.  Might be fine if doing very light pruning.
5.0,"They are Fiskars, what else can I say.  Great!"
5.0,"Great for cutting skinny limbs. Definitely made for wood, though. Doesn't cut electrical cable well."
5.0,Very sharp does the job perfectly
2.0,Returned as they felt fragile and thought they might break easily.
3.0,The scissor function sticks a little.
4.0,great
4.0,Good quality
1.0,These could not trim the smaller twigs on bushes and the end of the trees.
5.0,"Nice handles, great clips - pruning fast-growing plants is a breeze now!"
5.0,PRUNING SHEARS ARE SHARP AND WORK WELL IN THE YARD.  PRUNING SMALL BRANCHES AND MEDIUM BRANCHES.
2.0,Broke after only a few uses.
5.0,"These have worked well all summer, expect them to work again next year. I'm happy with my purchase"
5.0,Really do the job for me. Easy to use and cut well.
4.0,Works well & effortlessly.
5.0,"These are absolutely great clippers/shears.  I used to buy other brands about the same price from stores and the quality has never matched this product.  The lock feels solid, it doesn't make me feel that it's going to fail."
5.0,"good construction...feel good in hand...have carpal tunnel, but can readily use these shears"
4.0,"Well built, well used, and holding up well"
1.0,The shears broke after a single use.  I wouldn't recommend this product.
1.0,"These shears could only recommend for very light work -- in fact, nothing bigger than you would cut with kitchen scissor.  I used them to trim a moderate size bamboo and the shears broke (they got misaligned and will no longer close fully.)"
4.0,Nice shears
1.0,"Number of use 1,2 sorry no third time.$0.99 should be relatively expensive price for this junk"
5.0,Works great!!!! Better than all the other ones I have tried.
5.0,EXCELLENT. TRUTH IN ADVERTISING. WELL WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY.
4.0,Built quite cheap looks like it will break easy . However it works great
3.0,Cheap plastic so don't pay to much for this item.
5.0,Wow! This thing is a super sprayer! I use it to water my vegetable garden and I am very impressed with its range.
5.0,"Had nearly identical watering device that we used for some trees where it is impractical to place drip or soaker hoses. After many years it finally broke. Hoping to find something similar, and per usual, found it on Amazon. One of those cheap, nifty little ""devices"" that is very useful and does what it is suppose to. Hopefully, it will last as long as the other one."
2.0,"Decent sprinkler, kind of cheap feeling but for the price that is to be ecpected. It leaked pretty bad when I first got it so I had to use some teflon tape to help it seal. also the product came extremely dusty. The sprinkle pattern is pretty weak too."
5.0,This little sprinkler is perfect for our use.  Unfortunately I'm not able to purchase it locally so was happy to find it on Amazon.com
3.0,They seem to be built very well but after only about a month they are already dull and have a hard time cutting even small branches and stems...I thought they would have lasted years before I had a dull issue.
4.0,"Work good for the price and seem to be good quality. Not up to the Cutco pair we lost, but much more affordable."
5.0,Love these pruning shears!
5.0,"I loved these so much,  bought a second pair !!."
5.0,Great item for those that like fresh flowers like Sunflowers or Gladiolas as the stems are thick. These work well for house plants as well.
5.0,perfect for what I need
5.0,Everything as must be.
5.0,They work great!
5.0,"strong, sturdy, and sharp"
3.0,"I had hoped these would be sharper, I use them to trim the stems off flower my boyfriend buys me.  It's adequate, but not nearly as efficient as I had hoped."
4.0,I use this sprinkler not so much for a large circle as I have other sprinklers for wide coverage.  I specifically use this sprinkler for a small watering circle.  Because of its light weight the sprinkler works well at low flow for a watering circle as small as a 3-4 ft. diameter that I typically use to individually water my backyard ferns during drought conditions.
5.0,"A simple tool to water garden.  Easy. Well built.
Enough said."
5.0,"NIce, lightweight, small to medium area sprinkler. I like that it's blue, so easy to find if I put it down.
We have really hard water here, and most sprinklers don't last long. It's fine after a month, so we'll see."
3.0,"it works great, but very fragile. It came broken in the box, twice."
5.0,
5.0,Perfect for my little garden
5.0,This thing is GREAT!  It's a flimsy little plastic thing but it works SO well and we've been using it for months with no sign of wear.  We love the way it distributes water on the lawn so much that we choose to use it over our more expensive oscillating sprinkler.  I actually bought a second one of these along with a hose splitter and it worked wonders to get the lawn watered twice as fast.  Incredible price too.
2.0,"Does not reach anywhere around 50 ft in diameter. It reaches about half that, around 25 feet. However it was easy to setup and did not leak."
5.0,Good basic sprinkler
5.0,"Covers a decent sized circle. Worked very well. Put it on a very dry lawn, and ran it for an hour. The next day, I could see a large green circle in my lawn where the water coverage was. Did very well at resuscitating my lawn.

The only issue I have with it is that my golden retriever LOVES it a bit too much, and went after one of the sprayers. She partially broke it, but to its credit, it still works fine. I don't hold this against the sprinkler, as I would never expect it to hold up like a dog toy."
5.0,Sharp and easy to use with a safety locking feature. Love it!!
5.0,Fiskars = quality !
5.0,Easy payment. Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
5.0,"I have owned three pairs of these shears over the past 5 years. Fiskars has fixed some of the early manufacturing problems (handles slipping off, etc.)

My latest pair is very durable, well made, has secure handles and seems even sharper than my last pair.

PROS:
Sharp
Well made
Does not rust easily
Comfortable
Strong cutting power

You can't go wrong with these shears. I will continue to buy these as my ""go to"" gardening shears!"
4.0,Good prunig tool delivered as advertised in good condition.
1.0,Too heavy fo my hands.
5.0,"Fiskars products are always great. I've been using these to prune rose bushes that have never been pruned, working great!"
5.0,"Ergonomically designed, comfortable to use"
5.0,Super quality at a great Amazon price. The last ones finally gave out after 10 years. Local store prices were considerably higher. These work great and have nice ergonomics.
5.0,Love it!
5.0,Really good pruning shears
5.0,Great
5.0,"As soon as this arrived I got them out into the yard and working hard, I forgot how nice it is to have a new pair of Pruners. Arrived with a Sharp blade of course, Locking system works awesome with no worries of it sliding unlocked without your permission. Just add them to your cart already."
4.0,ECELLENT
5.0,Just what I was looking for.  These are sharp and do the job in pruning rose bushes and small shrubs.
3.0,"I'm somewhat disappointed in this product.  It looks substantial and professional. It has a button that must be pushed to open and close the clippers.  The button does not always work, and it takes two or three tries before the button engages and shears stay closed.  I'm using the clippers primarily for clipping flowers and making flower arrangements and as clippers, the item works fine."
5.0,I own about 5 pairs of Fiskars pruning shears and they are great tools and last a long time.
5.0,they work very well.
1.0,These are not good pruning shears at all. I used them to cut off a few very small branches about the size of a dime. It was a bit of a struggle to cut the branches off because the pruning shears were not very sharp. By the fourth branch the black blade bent and they would not close anymore. I threw the shears in the trash because they were not usable anymore. Don't waste your money as I did. Spend a little bit more money and get some shears that work and won't break like these did.
4.0,Serves is purpose well
4.0,My second set. Lost the first set somewhere or more likely did not put away last year. These are sturdy shears. Make sure to clean and put away for winter. Great for pruning in the Fall.
5.0,"Great little clippers. They are easy to operate, and the leverage is very good. They will cut through some pretty thick branches"
5.0,Received quickly.  Since we are moving I haven't had a chance to use it but it appears to be a good product.
4.0,just ok
5.0,Excellent garden tool!
5.0,Love it
5.0,"Shears are exactly what I wanted. Sharp, strong and very comfortable in the hand."
5.0,I rent and have a bush that grows up over my patio.  I'm upstairs and don't want the landlord or hired help to have to come through my place to trim it up so I got these.  Work great and don't take up a lot of my already limited space.
5.0,"Super sharp - cuts through decent sized branches and is excellent for trimming and pruning. Comfortable and a must have for a gardener!
Excellent product."
5.0,"Both products met expectations, and perform well."
5.0,love it and performs well
5.0,"I already have this shear, bought a second one to have on hand."
5.0,Best I've ever had!
5.0,Fiskars tools are second to none. Excellent quality and sturdiness. You'd be far more likely to lose them in the garden than wear them out
3.0,Performs as expected but metal quality is lacking. If not taken care of after each use they will probably rust.
5.0,Love Fiskars products! Always sharp and easy to use!
5.0,"As soon as I got these pruning shears in my hand, went to work in the yard trimming here and there. The place looks great now!! These shears cut fast and quick. Even 1/2 inch vines and branches don't have a chance. ;)"
3.0,Not as sharp as pruning shears should be.  Takes some strength to snip.  I wouldn't buy again and am looking for another brand.
5.0,these are awesome
5.0,"I love that these shears have a lock on them!  I use them often in my garden and find them to me the perfect size for getting between herb stems or rose stems.  The handles are padded and hurt my hands much less than kitchen scissors.  They don't handle large items, but do great with detail and small work.  I just wish I didn't have to hide them - everyone else in my house swipes them if I leave them out!"
5.0,"I bought this manure fork  to turn and mix my compost pile.  Does the job quite nicely.  I was originally searching for a long handled pitchfork.  I guess when they make pitchforks they don't realize that some people using them are taller than  4' 9""."
5.0,"Very nice fork.  I was replacing an old one that I've had for years, and after opening the box found it was identical to my old one.  This is a really handy tool for cleaning up pine straw.  Push it like a push broom and you can load it up very quickly."
3.0,The handle is to thick ......... and I ordered a four prong not a five. the craftsmanship is lacking the American Way of doing things.
3.0,Does what it was intended for
5.0,"I prefer to call it a ""Mulch Fork"" because that is what i use it for.  It works great."
5.0,Great sturdy fork is perfect for lots of chores!
5.0,A great cutter will cut a much larger stem than you think. It is very good to your hand too.
5.0,My wife's favorite.
1.0,"Did not meet my expectations, it has a damaged blade as received and is not usable.  ""David G Benner."
5.0,Works great
4.0,These work very well.  I use them for getting rid of english ivy growing on trees.  The safety catch that keeps them closed seems a little flimsy.
5.0,Does it's intended job.
4.0,They do the job from small thin plants to plants or bushes that you need to prune.  Easy to use and not hard on your hand.
5.0,"These Fisk as shears are the best.  I have owned many different kinds of other shears and always come back to the Fiskars.  They are light weight and strong.  I have arthritis in my hands but I can use these with no difficulty at all.  They cut through different size branches of shrubs and trim perennials perfectly with very little strain.  They fit in the hand very nicely and are extremely comfortable to use for long periods of time.  I highly recommend them to anyone, young or older."
1.0,"These broke with the first use. Seller reimbursed me without question though, so that was a plus."
3.0,"I do not care for the little button that opens and closes the pruning shears.  It seems like an after thought safety mechanism and is difficult to actually push opened or closed.  Otherwise, the shears work well.  But, this is a nuisance, since they need to be opened and shut frequently for safety reasons, but doing so is difficult."
5.0,"I needed some shears to prune my money tree and these were the best option available. They did exactly what I needed them to do. They've got a good weight and comfortable grip and were sharp enough to cut through the lower stem of the small tree. I've had them for a couple months now, and although I used them very sparingly, they have not broken, dulled, or rusted."
1.0,It sticks everytime.. very annoying. I can't use it for clipping more than maybe a small bouquet of flowers without wanting to throw it in the bushes
5.0,"Bought these for pruning small braches, bushes and that's exactly what they do, smoothly and without much exertion needed on your end."
5.0,These are easy to use and just love them.  They are sturdy and stand up to harsh treatment.  Good product.
5.0,they are easy to use and cut well.
5.0,I purchase a lot of flowers and this works so well in pruning
5.0,Easy to handle when cutting rose bushes or small tree branches.  Locks one handed which is good.  Stays together.
5.0,A handy little tool...
5.0,LOVE Fiskar products.  Have used their sewing shears for almost 3 decades.  I expect these will work as well as their other products.
2.0,I was expecting USA made and very disappointed they were not. I really try to buy USA made and am disappointed I can not rely on Amazon for this infromation.
3.0,Works fine but gets dull too quickly.
5.0,work great. Nice hand feel and cuts easily.
4.0,Love Fiskars cutting items from scissors to pruning tools. The only brand I will buy anymore.
4.0,Probably a very good product but was extremely DISAPPOINTED that in the product description it is listed as made in U. S ... but it is NOT ~ one guess as to where it's made ... China.  I am disappointed that AMAZON has not corrected this in their product description but I know they can't do everything at once ... so guess I'll have to let it slide.
4.0,"They were a little stiff at first,but after repeated usage, they loosened up. Great for dead heading my window box geraniums."
4.0,Great cutting power.  The one issue is the clippers don't always re-open well.
5.0,Great product and supplier.
5.0,These work so well that it makes trimming my bushes go so smoothly and fast!  Do I dare say I like gardening now?
5.0,Great deal
1.0,"I've always believed in Fiskars, but I will not buy these again, not sharp enough and doesn't cut clean.  I would rather use a steak knife the next time."
5.0,"I am new to the pruning thing, but these are nice. I own other Fiskar products and like the Quality to value ratio of their products. I would recommend them to friends, in fact I have."
5.0,I finally used them today. A very nice pair of pruning shears. Would recommend to anyone
5.0,"I had misplaced my previous pair of these wonderful shears (I'll probably find them buried in a pot full of soil next winter!), and I felt lost without them. From gently pruning a wilting branch on a delicate annual to pruning a full-grown and pesky rose bush, these shears are easy to us, easy to handle, and perform as though they cost $100.

Great value, great bargain, invaluable gardening tool!"
5.0,these are handy for trimming knock-out roses and other yard bushes that need trimmed.  nice and sharp and easy to use.
5.0,"No surprises here.  Strong and comfortable.  User friendly and at the price, you will be happily surprised at the extremely high quality."
3.0,"I bought this item because it seemed to be the best of what was there, as my very favorite clippers from last year weren't available. I think they got put into the 'burn pile'! Really, my biggest complaint about these pruning shears is that they don't 'release', or 'pop open' as they should right after a clip. One must physically open them to use again every single time. A little thing, yes, but still annoying when you are in a hurry. Also, I found the 'locking mechanism' hard to open and close. Sorry, Fiskars. I have many of your products, and have no complaint about any other!"
5.0,While I don't use my Fiskars Pruning Sheers every day ... as a weekend gardener - it's by my side and is a great help.
5.0,Good quality pruners but the price is the same at the local Home Depot. fairly light duty but good for 1/2 inch work.
5.0,"I have tried so many pruning shears that the Fiskars are almost too good to be true.  Comfortable, solid, heavy duty, easy to lock in the closed position.  The only negative is that it is a little harder to cut than I expected.  Still, well within acceptable range.  Thank you Fiskars--keep up the good work!"
5.0,Used to trim a date palm in front of my house.  It cuts easily and is easy to hold and store
5.0,"I use these to cut stuff and they cut stuff well.  I would take some pix and show y'all, but I have to go cut some more stuff."
5.0,Bought four new young trees and these trimmers do the job. Made out of quality material and sharp. Give them a try.
5.0,Quality of gloves appeared good. Gave them as a gift as part of a garden themed gift. Hopefully she liked them.
4.0,"UPDATE: Moved from 1* to 4* since Fiskar's sent me a new replacement (it was under warranty) without a hassle. Would be 5* if I had never seen this issue, but whatever. Original review below.

The blade broke within 5 minutes of use when trimming a bush branch less than 1/4"" thick. It didn't snap off but the cutting edge on the lower blade bent inwards such that it was now hitting the upper blade when trying to close/cut the shears. Since the shear blades cross each other, they don't close anymore and the shears are useless (imagine a scissor whose blades hit each other and won't close anymore)."
5.0,I purchased the Fiskars Bypass Pruning Shears.  They are real good for they are real sharp and a sturdy shears.  They are one of the best of many types I have bought.  I would recommend them to anybody.
5.0,"I used my shears for pruning palm fronds, dried up aloe plants, to cut up tiny bamboo sticks and small branches.  Comfortable grip and very easy to use.  Plus, I have small hands and I don't feel like I am overextending anything."
5.0,great price..here in 2 days.  great quality. fits in my gardening bag and easy to use. Soft grip handle on a steel base.
5.0,These shears work well and my wife who is a skeptic of most things of this kind is now using these shears almost daily.
5.0,Very good shears that are sharp.  I use them to cut the bottoms off flower stems for arrangements and they work great!
4.0,"The shears are sharp, comfortable and well balanced. They fit well in your hand and make it easier to maneuver while clipping the rose bushes."
5.0,These shears give good torque on the cut. My wife was able to cut very thick rose bush stems using one hand.
5.0,"I don't have a garden (one day), and I use these to trim stems of cut flowers. After getting sick of hacking up woody-stemmed and thick-stemmed flowers while trimming them, I said forget it, I need an upgrade. I looked around and settled on these, and they're a dream. They totally do the job while being easy to use and maintain. Highly recommended!"
3.0,lite duty tool.  I expected more from a tool in this price range.  for lite work does a great gob
5.0,As with all Friskers products these are a good quality and the handles are very comfortable.  They have been in constant use pruing my roses.
5.0,"They're great, comfortable, easy to use.
I had another pair that I lost.  They're an essential tool for all yard work."
5.0,These can handle thick bush branches and Rose stems are cut easily. They are sharp and smooth with nice action.
5.0,This is a simple and well designed pruning tool that I really like. It's ergonomic design is well thought out and it works well for a good price.
5.0,Great yard tool and easy to work it . I had to reorder another because I like it so much. One for front yard and one for back yard.
5.0,"I have many different types of Fiskar's tools for gardening. I have found it easier to use Amazon Prime and have gardening items shipped directly to our country house, rather than spend the gas money to go to a big box store. Quality tools, and even if left outside over the winter, a little oil and they come back to life. Love these tools! That is a ""shameless endorsement."""
5.0,"I use these nearly every day, keeping my yard crisp and clean. They're sharp and effective. I even use them to trim smaller branches off my trees."
4.0,"I love this item, but after using for 1 summer, it is sticking.  Description says it won't stick which is why I bought them; however, mine did stick."
2.0,"After just one use, this set of shears bent and was made inoperable.  I had to resurrect my old shears to get the job done."
5.0,These are good pruning shears and the padded handles are comfortable and keep the tool from slipping in your hand.
5.0,haven't used yet as I'm up in the tundra but have had fiskars in the past and am sure will do the job.
5.0,This product is easy to use and sharp enough to cut my established rose bushes.  It's also easy on the hand.
5.0,These shears arrived in time to prune even the toughest and hardest branches on palm trees and cactus.  Easy to unpack and use!
5.0,"Love these, they are so needed to trim up my large backyard with lots of plants and trees!
Easy gripping."
5.0,Great quality and they work very very well. I highly recommend these for anyone from beginners to highly experienced landscapers.
3.0,"i've used many fiskar shears but this one was uncomfortable for me.  i have some arthritis in my hand and the manner in which
this pruning shear felt/cut, didn't suit me.  i gave it to my gardener."
5.0,"Unlike the Fiskars Ratchet Anvil Pruner, this baby is 'all metal"" like it's grand-father!  Couldn't be happier, especially with the lock.  Much better than grand-pa!"
5.0,"I'm one of those gardening nuts that likes to keep every shrub, tree and vine in its place. Don't know if this is a sick control issue or if I'm trying for 'Master Gardener'. I lost my first Friskars when I moved and am thrilled to have another. They maintain their edge, are lightweight and easy to use."
4.0,What I can I say they are sheers. I don't do a lot of gardening any more so theses are fine
3.0,"good cutter for small rose and thin branches. not good for anything bigger than 1/2"" ...
i barely use it though .. its takes good effort to cut with it"
5.0,These shears are the best for the money.  They make clean cuts every time.  My previous pair lasted 9 years before they didn't cut cleanly.
4.0,The Fiskars Traditional Bypass Pruning Shears is effective for small and soft work. It does well with flower stems and vegetable vines but has difficulty with woody branches.
1.0,"This is my second pair, on the first pair the blade bent on the first cut! The second pair lasted longer, but that is only because I haven't been pruning anything for a while, but the bent also. And I wasn't cutting hard wood either, I was pruning a rose bush! Stay away from these pruning shears!"
3.0,"They work ok, but the first time I used them they got jammed.
I use 50 dollar shears, this is a backup pair for when I can't find mine.
Bottom line, they got the job done and what else do you need them for.
Was easy to UN-jam them and they still work fine."
1.0,I was quite disappointed when these shears locked in a partially closed position after being used for trimming shrubs for less than 5 minutes.  I have had good luck with prior Fiskar products.  I would not buy this product again.  I may be able to get them to work by disassembling them and then putting them back together.  Quite a hassle for a simple tool.
5.0,"My old shears fell apart so this is a replacement.
Makes a nice clean cut, handles are easy to grip and the button to close it works well.
Trimmed all my rosebushes with ease."
5.0,"these are so wonderful I have 2 pair so I don't have to look all over for them, good buy"
1.0,I bought this for my wife over Christmas. She did not try to use them until spring so as usual Amazon will not let us return them. The blade broke the first time she try it.
5.0,"I first started using Fiskar products for sewing.  I am pleased to report that their gardening tools are of the same high quality that I have come to expect with their scissors, etc.  The Fiskar brand delivers excellent products.  My husband loves their ratcheting lopping shears that I let him borrow."
2.0,"These shears are made cheap in my eyes. They are hard too lock and unlock, I was cutting back some roses somehow they wouldn't open up, like the two blades weren't line up from the factory. I can't even use them. Trying to lock or unlock seems to be a challenge as well. Would have not bought if I new all this was going on."
1.0,"This was the second Fiskar shears of the same model tried.  The first arrived with the blades crossed and was totally useless out of the box.  Amazon, to their credit, immediately replaced the shears which arrived in working order.  This was not to continue.  After  using them successfully a  few times the blades eventually crossed just as in the original shears.  Unfortunately, this occurred  too late to return the shears for a refund so repairs were attempted - with no luck.  In their present condition, these garden shears could not be sold at a garage sale.  They are junk."
5.0,I bought these so I could have them on-hand for whenever I got flowers (either from someone else or because I like to brighten up the areas I'm in with flowers). They work fabulously!
5.0,I often order Fiskars garden tools and find them to be durable and a good value. The pruning sheers are another good product and are getting a lot of use.
5.0,"Great to work with, sturdy, long lasting, 2nd pair of this style I have purchased.  Handles have a good grip and don't slip"
5.0,Worth it!!
5.0,"As usual, Fiskars products are almost always great. I use these all summer and they're still going. If I sharpen them every year or 2, I won't need to buy another pair for a long time"
1.0,"First time I used it, I was clipping some tree branches that were less than half inch diameter, and the blade got so bent that I had to return it.

I'm trying to be even gentler with the replacement, but it the blade still got dinged right away. This time however, it's still usable though, so I'm hoping it will continue to perform adequately and maybe even get sort of... broken in over time, or something.

Cheap, though."
4.0,"I give this product a high 3 stars (3.75), but naturally I have to round.

Here is why:

1) Excellent:  Lemon tree's fast growing green branches with stickers but no leaves.  You can actually hear the quiet ""snnpp!"" sound as you cut away the branch.  This is clearly the kind of cutting this product was made for.

2) Pretty-Very good:  penny to nickle diameter sized branches, both old growth and new.  Some of the reviews indicated there might be problems with older hard wooden branches.  These were, obviously, a little harder to cut, but the shears cut with little to no problems.  There is such satifaction when the branches come off easily, and the tree limb inches higher, or suddenly there is light where there was dense bush growth before.

3) Doable, but not good:  palm fronds.  Cutting through old and falling over dying palm leaves/fronds is hard.  So hard in fact that it required 3 or 4 tries coming from different sides of the frond, and much effort to get through th middle.  Plus, while cutting and twisting for this frond,  I bent the shears, (didn't know you could do that) such that the blades did not close all the way (??!!!??).  Fortunately, I had to do some more cutting, and that pretty much bend them back.  The blades close now, but there is a little catch.  While the width of the fronds are still within an acceptable size, these shears are clearly limited for this purpose.

4) 6 in one hand, 1/2 dozen in other:  The grips, while quite comfortable, do not necessarily stay on the handles.  My very first use (the lemon tree, the bushes, the pine tree branches, the palm fronds) lasted about 20 minutes.  Within this time, the grip on one of the handle started sliding off.  I pulled it back up, and it stayed attached (for now).  I don't know if there needs to be more adhesive appied, or whether this is a sign of more problems to come, but if you need a product whose ""fit and finish"" are beyond reproach, keep this tidbit in mind.

Conclusion:  Not bad, but these are not top of the line shears, nor are they intended to be.  They can do small jobs very well, but ""small"" can be a relative term, and in this case, does not apply to palm fronds.  They CAN cut quickly, completely, and comfortably on things that do fall within its scope."
1.0,"I should have known when the item said discontinued that it was because it was junk. This items blades don't pass each other right in order to cut. They hit each other and don't cut, they were a waste of money!"
5.0,"I went through two other pairs of snips and have a permanent dent in my left forefinger from clipping a rag quilt.  Halfway through I gave up and bought these and it was the smartest thing I ever did.  They worked perfectly and were ""painless"" to use!"
4.0,"Bought this for my wife, a petite soul, to replace some small limb clippers she dearly loved.  They are a bit big for her but they do what she needs them too."
4.0,"I am looking forward to using my pruning shears this summer in my flower and vegetable gardens. Practicing with it, it seems easier to use than my old tool."
5.0,I carry these with me whenever I am working in the yard. Other pruners in the price-range don't come close to these Fiskars. Highly recommended for home gardeners.
5.0,This is an excellent product.  Good quality and well designed. I highly recommend this product. I've owned Fiskars pruners before and have been very happy with them.
5.0,"I love the quality of this product, it was definitely a good choice for me. It was delivered in the shortest possible time, and I was very impressed with the overall purchase from amazon."
5.0,These little shears are handy and sharp and fit your hand just right with minimum effort.  Really like them a lot.
1.0,Big piece of junk and in my opinion very poorly and cheaply constructed. I got maybe 10 minutes of use out of this before it just completely broke. What a shame...
5.0,Good quality product. Feels heavy in the hand. I would recommend to another for purchase. Was ordered with a few other items
5.0,These are great clippers. Work well and are very well made. Good Quality that I would highly recommend to anyone for yard work.
5.0,"We actually have a lot of Fiskars gardening tools and we love them! We bought this as a Christmas gift for our neighbor and she loves them too. Highest quality, great grip, and they really work-even on larger cuttings. Can't say enough good about Fiskars products!"
5.0,They worked for me! At the start of the fall season I pruned some trees....I had no problem with these shears! They were easy to handle with no problems cutting through the branches. I would recommend these pruning shears!
3.0,"I have been using these a for a while doing my Fall and Winter pruning. I found they are not very good for the smaller branches on bushes. They just seem to clamp around a small branch, which slides up into the blades but does not cut it. On larger branches, 1/8"" or more they do OK."
2.0,The worst shears I have ever used.  The blades stick together and you have to manually open them after every cut.  Very frustrating ! Even oiling them didn't help.
4.0,"I priced this item at local stores in my area and the price is slightly lower on amazon, these shears were given as a gift and I bought a pair for myself. These are the same pruning shears I have purchased in the past and they last for years without any problems."
5.0,"Fiskars are always great.  They do the job, no problems as long as you take good care of them. Lost my last pair somehow."
5.0,These clippers are great and are exactly what I was looking for. They are small enough to store  but easy enough to keep handy for my uses.
5.0,"These are great, well-made pruners. The spring finally broke on the one I have used since the 80's.
Happy to find still available and still quality made ( even though now made in China )"
5.0,We moved into a forest house with nothing but over grown brush surrounding us. These shears are able to snip through the toughest of saplings with ease and have helped us make our house look like a home. Thanks Fiskars you make a great product.
3.0,"I am a little disappointed with these shears.  It cuts smaller branches O.K. but anything a little larger requires quite a bit of manual effort.  Moreover, the cutting action is not too smooth even after I applied lubricating oil to all the surfaces.  It sometimes tends to stick in the closed position after cutting, and then not springing back to the open position.  Then I have to help it re-open to make it ready for the next cut."
1.0,"Because of the good overall review (4 stars), I ordered two dozen of these for volunteers to remove ivy from a natural area. After a few minutes cutting ivy (some woody, but not big), several of the pruners were so knicked and bent that they would not close.  Fiskars needs to do better quality control on the plant producing these defective products--what a waste of good materials and time and fossil fuels to ship these around the world and back!"
5.0,"These are sharp and sturdy.  They cut, the first time without twisting or repeated attempts.  The grip and feel of the tool is comfortable and efficient."
1.0,"I was trimming a sapling growing next to my driveway, and after about ten snips, the blades got stuck. Confused, I examined them, only to discover the blades had already cut into each other after only 10 snips. It still works for the most part, but this is not the quality I expect from Fiskars."
1.0,These did not last even 3 minutes. The blade folded over into a burr on a little Crepe Myrtle stem and now it won't even close.
3.0,Was told they were made in USA. Not so. They are no better or worse than what you can buy at your local China outlet store.
4.0,I have used these several times and am very happy with them. They are easy to use and cut through even thick branches
5.0,well made. amazing quality. price is awesome. recommended buy. my sister was really happy with this as a gift. she said it was the holy grail of pruners
4.0,"I bought two types of this pruner, and my wife doesn't like this one because it is a little harder to use than the ""PowerGear Pruner"" from Fiskars.  But it is a strong and good pruner although it takes a little more strength to use than the Power Gear.  So this one is mine."
5.0,"This is just what I needed to do some late fall cleanup.  It is well made, and has sharp cutting edges for medium sized and smaller branches."
5.0,"I have plenty of these Bypass Pruning shears and whenever someone wants one or asks for my suggestion I always will say ""Get Fiskars""."
5.0,"It is not often that I get excited over yard tools...but these little trimmers made fall clean up a breeze.  They're sharp, sturdy, and well made.  I can't recommend them for anyone with hand issues (e.g. arthritis) because they do require a bit of hand strength."
4.0,"I bought these for my mother-in-law who has tiny hands. Tey are too heavy-duty for her, so I kept them for myself. A good working pair of shears."
5.0,"I USED have the most ugly, and disgusting toenails you'll ever come across if your lifetime. but thanks to these magical shears they're a thing of the past!"
1.0,"On the first use I cut a largish branch. After that the jaws would not close anymore, rendering them useless."
5.0,"This is my second pair of Fiskar pruning shears.. the first I gave to my daughter and I was so happy with how they worked for her that I bought a pair for my self.  I love the Fiskar brand, for all my shears, dress making and a pair for cutting duct tape for crafting..  These pruning shears did not disappoint.  I clean them after each use because I love them so much I want them to stay sharp and easy to use, as I have some arthritis.  right now Im using them daily to pick oranges from the tree."
5.0,"Great shears. They have sharp blades which cut through branches up to 2"" easily. Can cut thicker, but you need some serious hand strength and leverage."
2.0,bad model.  i have lots of fiskar products.  these rubbed against each other roughly.  didn't feel like quality.  i sent them back.  got a different pair ($10 at HD) a little smaller but just what i need veryday use and work wonderfully well
3.0,"Nice price for replacement clippers, but they don't easily snap open after you make a cut. They are also a bit large for my small hand, but most people would have no problem with size."
5.0,These have a great cut and are comfortable in the hands.  They make the tedious chore of cutting away dead perennials much easier.  I am already looking forward to spring and find out these work on more flexible branches.
1.0,"On the first try to prune a 1/4 inch diameter stem, the shears jammed about halfway closed and would not go any further.  The 2 blades were so misaligned that they would not close.  No amount of filing on my part would fix the problem, so I tossed them."
5.0,"They do the job right, and are everything I hoped they would be. Glad I bought them for my gardening set.
Would recommend it."
5.0,These cut through my rose bushes like I was cutting dandilions super sharp I just love the fit and the feel!
5.0,"Traditional is right.  I put them next to my 20 year old shears, and they look the same. Nice cut. Good solid pin bearing. Excellent handles.  Based on experience, I don't expect the grips to stay on long. I get a good purchase on the handles that allows me to cut wood a bit larger than the 5/8"" described.  Pruned a huge apple tree the other day.  A good eight hours of work.  Mainly taking off the water sprouts and interior branches.  Because it's winter, wasn't much sap to contend with. Used silicone grease beforehand, and no sticking or clogging in the blades.  Cutting Hand didn't suffer any damage including no blisters.  Lock works well, put the shears in back pocket while moving ladder and didn't open once. I don't have big hands, but I was able to position the shears for a close, clean cut every time
Arrived on time, well packaged. Very satisfied. I will recommend and probably get another pair at the sale price.."
5.0,Superior brand -- good price. I know they will last for a much longer time than other cheaper brands I've tried.
5.0,I needed some garden shears for my first garden. I'm not an experienced gardener. I found that these get the job done for trimming tomato and basil plants. Nice comfortable grip.
3.0,"Good balanced feel in the hand, cuts branches cleanly, decently made and priced, but, and it's a big but:  after only one week of use the blades stick or lock closed when the pruners are set in in the unlocked position. I have to ""shake"" or jostle the pruner hard, frequently, to unstick or get the blades to fall back into position mid-cut, or pause to use the other hand to unstick them, when I am in the middle of a pruning job. They are not sticking due to sap issues, they seem to be locking themselves, or reverting to locked position in use. Annoying!

I have the Powergear bypass Fiskars loppers, the smaller pruning shears and several other Fiskars items, and I love them all. I have never had this issue with any other Fiskars tool I own.

I purchased these shears brand new, still sealed in the hard plastic shell package with the store price tag on, at an estate sale locally for $5. If I had paid full price at a store, they'd be returned for a full refund there already.

I do appreciate that with very little effort, when they don't stick, they are very easy for me with very little hand strength/small hand size, to cut large diameter branches up to the 5/8"" diameter specified on the package by the manufacturer. The handles are comfortable, with or without gardening gloves on.

My pair is clearly labeled on the package that they are made in the USA. I have no issue with buying a reasonably priced, well- made product from elsewhere, if they work best/better than (or have a better price for the same quality), than a US-made item, but do prefer USA-made items if I can find them. I am not happy with these; not sure if it's a design flaw, a known manufacturing defect or what, but would not buy or recommend this model pruner from Fiskars to anyone."
5.0,This is the most fabulous pair of pruning shears that I've ever used. Love them!  Easy to use and gets great results.
4.0,"This pruning shear cuts cleanly and seems to be built sturdily.  It feels right in the hand.  Only complaint is it sometimes sticks in the closed position even with a clean blade and some oil- not a big problem, but annoying."
5.0,Just what we needed. We have been using these to cut down a particularly stubborn blackberry vine in our yard.
1.0,"Thought these would be good, but kept sticking requiring the use of two hands.  I tried to put some WD 40 to loosen them up, but that did not help.  I could have been just the pair I received, but Amazon refunded and all is well"
4.0,"These scissors have not tested yet, but are very sharp, are lightweight and are of good quality. I hope to use them soon in my garden."
5.0,Very Sharp But Love Using In My garden. Would Recommend For Many Outdoor Needs Or Indoor Crafting As well. Would recommend
5.0,Work as described and handles are comfortable.  Blades are sharp and cut precisely.  Would recommend these to other gardeners as well.
5.0,"As any Fiskars product, this tool is solid and a friendly companion in the garden. Keep the moving parts oiled and clean and should last for a long time."
5.0,"The last pair lasted me 5 years of use.  Great product.  But like any other tool, don't leave it in the rain....."
5.0,I have used these on shrubs and thick stemmed weeds in the yard and in my gardens.  Work great every time.
4.0,These appear to be like a pair we have had for years.  They are not as well made but that is the way for most every thing today.  These are good.
5.0,The  Fiskars pruning shears has the correct hand fit one needs. The cushion handles makes the pruning easy. The blade shape and size is just right for the work that is needed
5.0,"Great tool for clipping wayward vegetation. The tool is lightweight, but sturdy enough to clip the shrubs around my house."
4.0,I chose this product because I have Fiskars scissors and I'm happy with their quality.  These shears arrived quickly and are as described in product details and pictures.
5.0,I  wore my other one out.  I have a long handled one but sometimes I have to trim in restricted spaces. I'll give this one a good work out.
5.0,Good to have one reliable tool at the garden and Fiskars definitely could serve its purpose.  Handles are steady and easy to grab.
3.0,I always buy Fiskers tools.  But these shears do not work right.  They cut great but they don't release after cutting.  I have to pull them apart.  I may have gotten a lemon.
5.0,"We have used this new tool lately, and the hedge and other overgrown trees, bushes, and vines look much better."
2.0,This is for someone with very large hands. The blade sticks after each cut and is awkward to handle. I am disappointed in the function and would not recommend.
5.0,very pleased.  They do the trick as designed.  Amazon says i have to write 14 more words so this is my sentence to do so.
1.0,"Bought these for my wife as I used her last pair of shears to cut chicken wire.

Straight out of the box, these shears were extremely dull and difficult to maneuver.

Generally, fiskars seems to make pretty solid products, so I wonder if it was just a fluke with these.

At any rate, returned and exchanged."
2.0,"Made in China and it shows. They are sprung to open automatically between cuts but the fit is so poor that fresh out of the box the shears bind and you have to push them open manually to use them. That problem does not get better with use making them a hassle to use. Return shipping for me is $5-10, so they are not worth sending back, but don't waste your money."
5.0,I'd forgotten how easy a good pair of pruners make gardening! These are easy to handle and work on lots of bushes and plants!
5.0,This product is exactly as described. It was processed and shipped as promised. It arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. I love these. I replaced my old pair that I had for about 20 years. Good quality and work great.
5.0,It cut through thick rose branches (diameter of 2cm) with ease. 5 stars for the clean cut. By the look of it I'm sure it will last for years to come.
5.0,"The Fiskars pruning shears are easy to hold and make nice cuts.  (Of course it helps if you take care of your tools, so be sure to clean them before putting them away and sharpen them properly as needed.)"
5.0,"Quality product made of good hard steel.  They have kept a good cutting edge continue to make good, clean cuts."
5.0,I have used many pruning shears but Fiskars are my favorite.  I have another pair of Fiskars that are smaller and they are great for pruning small bushes.  These are also good for small bushes but are strong enough for large thick branches as well.  Highly Recommended.
1.0,"When you close the blades, they should spring back open of their own accord.  These stick in the closed position.  The package that the shears arrived in had already been opened.  I suspect that the shears had been sold once and then returned for the same problem that I experienced.  I have had that happen at other locations before and if I am shopping locally, I make it a point to NEVER buy something in a box or package that has already been opened once. It usually ends up being defective."
4.0,This item was recommended to me so I purchased it because of that. The objection that I have with this tool is that it does not open wide enough for some of the branches that I wish  to cut. It does a good job on branches that will bo between the blades.
5.0,"I do a lot of gardening, so I need a good pair of shears I can count on to trim the rose bushes, the hydrangeas and even the errant tree branch that seems to keep coming back.  These do all the small jobs with ease.  Great product!"
4.0,"The old pruning shears finally bit the dust this summer, which could only mean one thing.  It was time for a visit to my old friend Amazon.com to find a new pair.  As usual, Amazon had many different kinds and sizes to choose from but after a bit of browsing, I decided to give the Fiskars 9109 a try.  They looked like decent enough shears and at $8.75, the price was right.

When our new shears arrived we wasted no time getting out in the yard to trim back our low hanging tree branches, as well as the volunteer trees that continually crop up around the foundations of every building on the place.  Let me tell you, the Fiskars are razor sharp and they cut easily and cleanly through branches up to approximately the diameter of a quarter.  They'll cut larger branches than that but it does take a bit more effort.  The handles are a very comfortable fit to the hand and I found that my hand did not ache after several minutes.  I also like the locking mechanism: it's easy to engage and puts a very solid feeling lock on the blades.

Only time will tell if the blades remain sharp and the spring holds up, but so far I'm very pleased with these shears."
5.0,Use these pruners all the time. Excellent. Sharp. Light weight. Very well constructed. I would recommend these to any gardener.
5.0,Can't go wrong with the Fiskars brand. A great tool for all. Nice clean cuts and easy to use. Great
5.0,"Nice and Sharp, seem very sturdy. Hopefully these will last much longer than my other ones. Very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I chose 4 start to many reasons
shipped and received on time
great packaging
product not damaged
product works great and sharp
I will recmmened to others for sure"
5.0,"This is the 2nd pair of these that I have had.  The first ones blades got dull and spring didn't work after 10 years.  I will definitely get another pair again, but it be 15 years downs the road."
5.0,This is a very durable product that can cut hard branches and stems. Great for pruning roses and orchids and other hard flowers
5.0,"I do a lot of pruning in my yard from spring through fall.  These shears make clean cuts on small branches, lavender, a large bed of thyme, tall sage, roses and more without sticking. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I used these to remove about 4 trashbags worth of woody shrubs and weeds from the front yard without issue.
They are comfortable and cut smoothly."
4.0,"These Fiskars 9109 Traditional Bypass Pruning Shears, although I find a bit large for my hand,  so far seem a good value, for the price, and the locking mechanism easy to use, unlike  most shears I have owned."
5.0,This is just what I needed to prune my roses after misplacing my other pair.  My roses were very happy after I finished.
5.0,"Efficient, well-designed, and I love the orange so I don't keep losing 'em among the undergrowth!  I love the easy open/close mechanism."
3.0,"Easy to use, ergonomic, compact-size and perfect for those tiny, hard-to-reach stems that need pruning.  I frequently use it on my dahlias, salvias and tomatoes when scaling back growth & trimming off dead flowers.  I only wish that the tip would be a little bit smaller because it occasionally (...I say occasionally, but it's mostly due to my clumsiness...lol) tears the leaves of my delicate, flowering plants."
4.0,"Seems to be a good product for a good price. It is too soon to know, as I have only used it a couple of times. I needed something to work on thicker branches and it does that."
5.0,"Got these for my Dad as a present, he's always outside gardening and his old shears were getting laughably dull. This pair of Fiskar pruning shears however are very sharp and get the job done just fine.

I've seen him cut branches and limbs up two a few inches in diameter and they seemed to do the job just fine. For the price I would argue that this is quite the deal. I would have no problem recommending these to another buyer."
3.0,"It needs oil treatment I guess and not happy when it's a brand new product!  Search online to see what kind of oil to use and it is not cheap.

I brought one (same brand) from Homedepot and was using it for many years (appx 8+ yrs), then finally the spring gone last year, so it won't automatically closes and the lock kept sliding back on it's own so I constantly had to unlock it while pruning.  The handle was better from the old one as it curves more plus the rubber from the handle is much softer/cushion to the touch and last forever.  The new one is more of a straight line and the rubber handle is more grainey and hard, so not as comfy at all.  The cuts is about the same but still think the old one is better when new...maybe due to the screaks.  Somehow this one feels a little heavier as well.

Overall, I know it's a good product and it withheld well with rough uses...like cutting large hard stems, digging into the ground for root cuttings, no oil treatments, etc.  Though I need to sharpen it from time to time and the Prunning Shear sharpener I had was just ok as the opening of this shears isn't wide enough so can't sharpen it all the way but perhaps half way.  This is spoken from the old one I had as I don't see this new one will have much of a different experience."
5.0,I like the unlock idea on this you can use one hand to open it and use or to close.
1.0,"Here is what is in the description: ""The 9109 Bypass Pruner is manufactured by Fiskars in the USA."" The packaging clearly states MADE IN CHINA.  That was problem number one. Problem umber two was that there is a nick in the blade. The good thing is Amazon has allowed me to keep these shears (that I did not want since they are Made in China).  I guess the cost of returning is greater than the cost of not."
5.0,I have 15 rose bushes to prune in my yard and needed a good pair of sheers. These are great and I use them several times a weeks and the cut perfectly and the price was way cheaper than at the store for the same quality shears. I recommend.
5.0,"Of course these are good because they are a Fiskars.  They are strong, handy and comfortable to use.  Highly recommend."
3.0,I went online to find pruning shears made in USA and these Fiskers came up on the Amazon site. I ordered them under the impression they were US made. They are made in China and I could have bought them at Home Depot for less money. They prune okay for limbs less than a half inch.
5.0,"I've had several pair of Fiskar shears, and like the rest, these are very durable, lightweight and easy to handle."
5.0,i buy a new pair about every 5-6 mths.. i do landscaping and lawn maintenance so i get my moneys worth.. i
4.0,I purchased these in order to teach Afghans to properly trim trees in the Agriculture of their country.  They were amazed at the quality of the shears so far above what they are able to get.
2.0,"My wife and I bought two pairs of these shears, one for each of use.  Within a year of use, the rubber grips on both had split and fallen off.  Without the grips, these are painful to use.  We tried to make new grips out of some bicycle handlebar grip and it somewhat works, but now I am looking to just replace them with something better.  So although they seemed to cut fine, the low quality made them unusable quickly."
1.0,"Per the included Prop 65 warning label, this product causes cancer due to the use of toxic materials.  I returned it immediately for a refund."
5.0,When I first started gardening I didn't know anything about anything. I bought some cheep pruning shears and quickly learned they were crap and used scissors instead. These are great. They are a good price and work great. They are comfortable and easy to use. they keep my planst healthy and they are not ugly.
5.0,"These are amazing! Though I'm an avid amazon customer, this is my first review. These shears beat all my expectations! Even cut through thicker branches (with a little work) on a dying tree. Highly recommend them."
5.0,"These are sharp, easy to handle, and cut like butter.  Fiskars makes a great product.  I would order these again anytme."
4.0,"I just moved in to a new house and the landscaping is a mess. I needed a small pair of pruning shears for the large bushes in the beds closest to the house. These shears will make it easier to shape the bushes after my fiance goes Chainsaw Massacre all over them. They come in a protective sheath as well, which will make it easier to carry them in my pockets while I work."
5.0,Used it all during the fall pruning season and found it sharp and easy on the hands to cut with
5.0,No complaints!!! Completely satisfied with the product and company that provided it. I would not hesitate to do business with this company again.
5.0,It's a Fiskars!!  No wonder it works so well.  I have completely happy with these.  Wish i had more than one.
5.0,I prune so much that I normally go through two pairs of shears per season.  These are still sharp and going strong.  The sharp edge still cuts quickly after a lot of use.
1.0,"Blatant misrepresentation. I chose this pruner because I wanted a quality product that was made in the U.S.A. I do not desire to contribute to a crippling trade deficit, nor do I wish to support a country that has a business community and government as corrupt and immoral as China's. I also wish to have my money go to support jobs with decent pay and humane working conditions. Under the heading ""Product Description"" in the ""From the Manufacturer"" section it stated ""The 9109 Bypass Pruner is manufactured by Fiskars in the USA"". The product packaging states ""Made in China"". Classic bate and switch. I will never buy another product from Fiskars. I'll get of my soap box now."
5.0,"I bought these for trimming and maintaining my roses and they've worked great. They have a sturdy feel to them and make quick work of the various plants and branches I've used them on so far. They cut cleanly and comfortably without fail and show no signs of wear. The locking mechanism is a bit small, but still very usable."
5.0,These cut branches easily and are easy on my hands. I do a lot of pruning and theses are my favorite.
5.0,PERFECT!  I had always just picked up whatever was cheap at Wal-Mart or something... what a difference!  So much better... and still affordable.
3.0,"I have owned these shears for two years. The first year they were okay - they were a little stiff in unlock them, but they did cut. I alternated with an older pair of shears for my gardening needs. This year the cheap vinyl covering on one of the handles came loose and there was a big hole at one end. Now this covering will not stay in place when using the shears. I guess this what happens you buy cheap material to make your product."
5.0,"The spring in this pruner broke after quite a bit of use; I don't recall when we purchased it.  I emailed Fiskars asking for a replacement spring.  Within a week an entirely new tool arrived in my mailbox!

When they say ""lifetime guarantee"", this company really means it!  Outstanding customer service!"
5.0,"Like these shears.  They are replacing an identical Fiskars model which my husband misplaced.  They are compact, sharp and easy to use."
5.0,I have cut some thick branches from my tree with these. They slice through like butter. Best purchase ever. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to make their pruning easier.
5.0,"When our previous shears went missing, we needed a replacement. We managed to find the same pair as our missing ones (which we loved). We got just what we needed and expected. Nice size for my small hands. Nice safety lock. Easy to store."
5.0,"I love these pruning shears, they just glide with your fingers. They have stayed sharp for me all summer. You won't be sorry for buying this product."
3.0,"These shears a robust and for pruning. They are not for cutting your flowers or anything else. Instead they're heavy duty and made to cut branches.

Good: Heavy, sturdy, will cut fairly thick branches (I've cut half inch thick bamboo with no problems)
Bad: Does not have a ""stop"", some other shears will let you cut the branch halfway off and keeps the ends locked around the branch. These don't."
3.0,I've used my pair of shears for quite a while now and I like them.  They say sharp and are comfortable but they gum up with sap easily and then stick together.  Not a bad pair of shears though.
5.0,"The shears are sharp and work great.  This is a must to keep in your everyday gardening tool kit.
Love it."
5.0,"Friskar pruning shears are the best!!  Completely satisfied with the product.  They stay sharp longer, and are more durable than other brands."
2.0,"The pair I got were poorly made. The blades didn't line up. Tried to tighten the nut and no go. Mine lasted a couple years and fell apart. They never worked right in the first place. Had to buy another pair. I should have returned them right at first, that's my fault, but Fiskars is a brand I avoid now."
3.0,"I've owned mine for 7 yrs. now...  There are two important things to note about it:
1.  The safety lock fell apart and fell off by year #2 [I use a rubber band or twist tie to keep them closed in storage].  Personally, I feel that was very poorly constructed to fall apart, but also it didn't always stay locked.  So, if that's a big issue for you, don't get these pruners.  Definitely would be concerned in a household where kids could get a hold of these.
2.  Stainless steel issue....  These will rust if left wet.  The operative word here is ""left"".  I wash mine after every use and them proceed to dry it carefully.  If left wet, these pruners WILL rust.  But if you dry them off, they don't rust.
3.  Teflon coating...  While a nice idea, someone forgot that pruners/shearers/etc. do need to be sharpened.  During the sharpening process, well, there goes your teflon coating.  Don't look at that as a big selling point as it won't matter down the line.
4.  Oil... Simply, put, this pruning tool needs it from time to time.  A few reasons:  keeps the blade from rusting if/when stored wet, keeps rust from forming around bolts/screws, keeps it operating more smoothly & easily.  I give it a good coating of WD40 before storing it for the season and spray it every now and again during the use seasons."
1.0,Look good but pure junk as the hingle is plastic and mine broke the second time I used it
5.0,"You can count  on Fiskars for a quality tool.  My shears get a great workout in my gardens, nice to have a dependabale product."
1.0,Give me a Wolf Garden pruner any day of the week.  I asked for garden tools for my birthday and got this from my sister.  I use Wolf garden tools and got these.  No comparison in quality. Sorry Fiskars but your made in China quality does not hold up.
1.0,"I've used a few different Fiskars garden tools, and they do not stay sharp for very long at all. Not worth it. Spend more on Felco brand and get quality that lasts for many years."
2.0,Grips slide off all the time.  Big gap between the blade and the anvil which leaves a rough cut.
5.0,I needed these pruning shears. They work great. I am very happy with them and this purchase.
5.0,"I've  owned about a half dozen pruning shears over the years. I've never worn any out. Mostly I lose or misplace them and then I buy a replacement. About 2 1/2 years ago I was picking up some new tools in a garden shop and I bought a pair of Fiskars pruning shears. I'd never heard of the brand, but the clerk assured me that Fiskars made good garden tools. (I might add that Fiskars was about the only brand the shop sold.) Well, I purchased the Fiskars pruning shears and a Fiskars lopper and I've been very satisfied with these particular garden tools, much more so than other brands I've owned.

The Fiskars Pruning Shears are somewhat crude in appearance but they're ruggedly built and maintain a sharp cutting edge. I've put these shears to a lot of use and they've yet to be sharpened. Plus, the blades seem to be absolutely stiff and don't bend under forceful use. I can cut green limbs up to about 3/4"" with these.  I'd say this is the best pruning shears I can remember using, certainly much better than the last two brands. I can't help notice ""Made in U S A"" stamped on one side of the tool. I hope this is still true.

Gary Peterson"
5.0,This is a very simple product but fiskars for some reason always ends up with better products. the blades on the shears have stayed sharper longer than any other brand i have tried. and the locking mechanism on the side is very no nonsense.
5.0,"I like these a lot -- I bought them last May to cut back our lilac and forsythia bushes which hadn't been pruned in several years. The shears cut easily through both thick and thin stems, you can even cut several thin branches at once. I've since used them on average of once a week to cut and trim back tree branches and saplings as well as roses and other bushes. Fwiw, they do tend to do better on green or growing wood than on dead branches. As another reviewer noted, the foam handle covers can slide off but I glued mine back on and haven't had any problems since. The blades are easy to keep clean and the lock keeps them locked even if you say, toss them on the grass or a chair. Note, these aren't for pruning large tree branches or tough, thick bushes but they're great for basic pruning."
2.0,"Not what I expected...FISKARS are supposed to be high quality stainless  made in Finland. These are ordinary steel, ordinary pruners, made in the  USA for Fiskars. I returned them. Fiskars Garden Shears Model 9637 are the  real thing.  But now that these pruners are reduced in price, as long as  you know what you are getting, they aren't a bad buy."
4.0,"Giving this 4 stars because I was pleased with an older version of this product from Gilmour.  The Amazon description is correct, but the picture is wrong.  It's the older 6-ply version. The new one, which I recieved today, is their latest 8-ply. Go to the manufacturer's website to read more about that if interested. My hose does not have the blue sleeve pictured in Amazon's pic. The 8-ply does not have a sleeve.

Looks to be a good product.  Lifetime replacement guarantee.  This hose is 1/8"" larger than the typical 5/8"" size you see in stores; and it is noticeably bigger. Looks like something you'd see at golf courses or in commercial settings.

The free shipping is quite a deal - $9.99 subtracted.  Other garden hoses at Amazon, even some from same manufacturer, have shipping charges because it's done through a 2nd/3rd seller.  So, I'd take advantage of this while you can!"
5.0,"This hose is ""industrial-strength"" and will probably last a lifetime.  After going through cheaper hoses I decided to get one that will last, not kink, and can be used with my pressure washer - this one fits all of the above.

I also use them with the Nelson brass impulse head sprinklers (ASIN: B0002IKUGO) - daisychaining sprinklers from multiple hoses - as an alternative solution to an in-ground sprinkling system.

This hose is rated at pressures you may not need (500 PSI), and is constructed to be impervious to just about any chemical or temperature you will encounter in home use. The fittings are solid and mate perfectly with facets (unlike other hoses I've used).

Although these hoses are practically kink-proof, they are somewhat stiff and heavy.  For sprinklers and other applications this is not a problem, but for hosing down driveways, etc. they are tiring if you are dragging it over a large area.

I view this hose as a great investment because it may be the only hose you'll ever have to buy."
5.0,works well
5.0,Good spray nozzle. Sprays a good distance and does not leak. Nice value.
4.0,I was impressed with the quality of this unit...bought two...should last a while...Dave M.
5.0,Nice
2.0,"Too heavy, too easily kinked, difficult to roll and unroll. After several years of use, purchased originally for attaching to a pressure washer, I'll be replacing it with something else."
1.0,"fitting broke on both hoses, not happy...."
5.0,"On September 27th, 2011 Ipurchaseda Gilmour 10-34050 3/4-Inch-by-50-Foot 8-Ply Flexogen Hose. Prior to thiswe had an economy hose we'd purchased at our local garden store. We needed to replace our previous hose witha more heavy duty hose because we had excessive water pressurethat split our other hose. This hose was amazing. Like others have stated it holds it coil shape quite a bit but that didn't bother me much, on hotter days it relaxed more than on colder days. At the time we were living in a rental and used this hose for nearly a year before we relocated out of state. We unfortunately left this hose behind andevery time I use a hose I regretleaving it behind. If we're ever in need of a heavy duty hose I will re-purchase this product.
Seller: Amazon LLC
Condition: New
Purchase price: $37.99 (Shipped)"
5.0,Best hoses I have ever used.
5.0,This is the only hose I have ever had last this long. And I leave them outside year-round in northeastern Winters . With their lifetime replacement simply save your proof of purchase they will send you another one . They may require you to cut the ends off and send them back for replacement. You honestly cannot go wrong stop buying cheap hoses. PS: do not disclose that you leave them outside during the winter
5.0,"They are the only ones I use. They are kept out  year 'round. When I say they, I mean we have hoses stretched from one side of 7 acres across and around and snaked over to the other side, of 7 acres. The hoses are not put away. They are kept out in the scorching 115 to 120 heat of the Nevada Desert Sun, and still they survive the 14 winters  with no problems. No cracking, no bubbles, no leaks."
5.0,"This is the best hose I've ever owned.  Period.  After 10 years this thing is still going strong.  It's been outside during it's entire life.  Never stored inside even in winter.  It is relatively heavy but coils easily on my wall hanger.  No signs of giving up either.  I read where others had leaks at the fitting, etc.  They may have run over theirs or got a lemon.  But mine has outlasted every other hose in the neighborhood many times over.  I've even left it laying out in the yard with full pressure in it for months in the hot Texas summer heat without failure of any kind.  I'd buy this hose over and over again if I ever needed a new one.  It still has the original fittings, has never been patched in any way and just keeps on going year after year after year...I didn't know they make anything this good anymore."
5.0,"What a Great hose! I've only had it a couple of weeks so I can't speak to warranty - but many others have. It coils easily, rarely kinks and reaches from here to tomorrow with great water pressure/volume."
4.0,"I don't know if it's THE greatest hose, but what is true, is that they have a terrific guarantee ! I called, they answered within a few minutes, I provided the serial number, and I received a new hose a week later !"
5.0,"The hose that I purchased was green. (older 2010) This hose is without a doubt the best hose I've ever used. We had Gilmour hoses for years on the farm. They stayed out in the weather 365. They are very, very high quality. Don't be fooled by the ones Lowe's Home Improvement stores sell. This is an 8 ply 3/4-inch hose and very stiff and hard to kink. It is made in America and has a lifetime warranty. The negative comments on here really surprise me."
5.0,"Good product, hard to find size"
5.0,Good heavy duty hose specifically and only used on a heavy 4-wheel garden hose reel for our home defense fire suppression system.
1.0,"Junk, like everybody says, BUT it had a lifetime guarantee (this hose was guaranteed for its life, not my life), I wisely saved the paperwork and the new owners of the company (Fiskars) sent me a new hose (failed hose lasted a few years). New hose is nice. Completely different technology. Heavy and solid. Tough reinforcing cord. Not carcinogenic. Nice hardware. So, purchase this garbage on the cheap and when it fails they will send you a nice new $80.00 hose for free. Just make sure you can live with this hose's horrible kinking behavior. It's as limp as a noodle. Needs Viagra AND Cialis!"
5.0,Heavy duty and large diameter.  Just what I needed.  Lifetime warranty is valuable.
5.0,"This is a heavy duty hose. Next time I will go with the 5/8"" or 1/2"" but other than that I have no complaints. In the past I had an issue with a Flexogen and their warranty service is second to none. I cut off the end, mailed it in and in two weeks there was a brand new replacement hose at my front door at no cost. These hoses cost a little more but the quality and warrranty are worth it!"
4.0,"Kinks in a couple of places, otherwise grfeat."
5.0,I bought this for my dad.  He still uses it and says it is very durable.
1.0,I did not receive the pictured item. The hose I received is black and too stiff to unroll and is not labeled anywhere with the Flexogen brand name.
5.0,works great
3.0,Heavy to use. Kinks and leaks have happened.
5.0,"This is a very heavy duty hose, so be prepared to have to lug it around."
3.0,"Good durable hose, but the fact that it never really leaves its form shape as shown in the picture makes it tiresome to always straighten out the hose and it is kinked around the nozzle on mine since I received it so it restricts some water flow, I just never got around to writing the company or Amazon or anything."
3.0,"wasn't green, or lightweight or easy to coil for me.  but it was long and reached where I wanted to go.  will see how it handles the winter............"
5.0,"Very nice, well made, high quality garden hose, but note it is gray rather than green."
5.0,Best Hose I every bought.  The pressure increase from the larger diameter is amazing and the quality of the hose is good.
5.0,Better than expected. Industrial grade. High flow.
2.0,"I have bought several of these hoses and had been very pleased.  I have one hose that has stayed coiled and attached to a hose that is primarily used to water the yard with.  The hose that has stayed coiled I need to return under the life time warranty, it has bulges from day one.  A recent hose I ended throwing out, I was getting ready to repair it again from dog damage and did a temporary tape job, that is when it bulged for a good three feet in the middle of the hose.

I don't know if is Arizona heat that causes these hoses to kink up and break down over time.  Over time they seem to kink up easily and I have a hundred footer that I need to mend as it had a little tear on the side which has now turned into a big tear but not leaking yet.

So it seams that these hoses are good for three years."
5.0,This is/was a top notch hose! Why was it discontinued??
5.0,Almost as big as my shlong
5.0,The best hose on the planet.
5.0,so far it's still holding up
4.0,good product.
5.0,excellent quality hose
5.0,Ok.  Pretty color.
5.0,"Having a 3/4"" hose is absolutely amazing. It gives you much greater water pressure (and we have low water pressure with our well). It does kink (not as much as the cheap hoses) and it is so stiff and heavy that it is difficult to maneuver around. Been using it for quite some time. Contractors we've had to the house love using it too, I'm sure we've sold a few for Gilmour when they try it and buy it for themselves."
5.0,Strong product. The kink free statement is iffy but good product overall.
5.0,"hose good. but ends came loose, had to use hose minder on both ends"
2.0,"Not very flexible in cool weather, kinks often. I bought 4 of these hoses, 2 leak at the pressed brass to rubber hose. (@80psi)"
2.0,"It's too bulk and heavy, it does looks durable. but after one or two time use I just put it away for storage in garage"
5.0,I water my pasture with a couple of these hoses and it just wouldn't be practical with a lesser hose. The fact that this doesn't kink when you're dragging it around makes all the difference.
5.0,Received the hose in good time. Gilmour has changed the color of the hose to gray. (same hose just changed the color.) Gilmour has one of the best guarantees..
5.0,"Only brand I will buy.great warranty,well made.should be the last hose I will ever have to buy.great day in the morning!"
5.0,"This has got to be the best brand hose there is. It works well and has a lifetime warranty. Just cut the ends off, send them in, and you'll get a new hose in a couple of weeks. Can't beat that. The 3/4"" is way too big to be pulling around the yard as it turns out but it does deliver a much higher volume of water than a 5/8"" hose. If I were to buy another one it'd be a 5/8"". If you need a hose, I'd get this brand. Hands down."
3.0,"I just received the hose and since temperatures are between -5 and 20 degrees, I haven't been able to use it.  It seems to be a very sturdy hose and well made.  May write a review later."
5.0,"I used a 5/8"" hose to fill a hot tub, and it took an hour.  Next time, I used my new 3/4"" hose, and it took 45 minutes."
5.0,"I've never seen this product in any hardware store, so I didn't know there was a heavy-duty 3/4"" hose. A 3/4"" hose delivers almost twice as much water per minute as a 5/8"" hose, so this is great for heavy watering, and essential if you need a long hose. The red rubber hoses commonly sold have been cheapened in the past several years and no longer last more than a couple of years. I presume that this hose is as tough as the 5/8"" Flexogen hoses, in which case it's a good bargain despite the rather steep purchase price."
5.0,I bought a bunch of these for farm irrigation. They are on their 3rd season and no issues at all. I drag them around the property over some rough terrain and never a nick or scrape. They don't kink or twist and the ends seem well made.
1.0,"This is my third Gilmour 3/4"" 50 foot 8-ply Flexogen hose.  My first was 2002, and I retired it in2008 when the outer layer a a couple of kink spots started tearing.  My second was 2008, and I returned it last week to Gilmour for warranty replacement.  This was the new one.

I hooked up a standard spray nozzle after a few days of used without nozzle, walked back to the faucet, turned it on, and BAM, the nozzle and the brass part inside the male end went flying about 3' from the end of the hose.  I am returning this, and won't be ordering from Gilmour again.  I will use whatever replacement Gilmour sends me for the 2008 hose warranty return, but won't be spending any more money with Gilmour until I see what they replace this now discontinued hose with.  This was purchased only two weeks ago, so fortunately I can send it back to Amazon for a full refund."
5.0,"Get good water flow with a soft and flexible hose .  The brass ends are well made of castings, not little thin sheets of brass."
5.0,Great flow - super heavy no kinks and a great hose with some ability to have a huge volume of water too
4.0,"One reason for the rating is that durability is a major component of eval and I've only had this hose for a month.  I previously bought the 3/4 6-ply and liked it a lot but this 8-ply is pretty stiff.  It also has a lot of coil memory which wasn't a problem with the 6-ply.  It's not that cold in LA but maybe come summer when it gets into the 90's and 100's the heat will soften the hose and these issues will disappear.

After 10 months..... The hose lost it's coil memory once the weather warmed up (> 70 degrees) but has remained pretty stiff. Durability is fine so far but it's less than a year old with only weekly use. The 8-ply doesn't kink as easily as the 6-ply but I'm not sure the weight penalty is worth the trade off for me. Anyway I've upped my rating to 4 Stars."
5.0,"I'll buy more of these come  Spring. Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho.  A bit on the heavy side, but that is what makes them last so well."
5.0,"I use this with my 4000psi 4gpm pressure washer.  The hose isn't as bad as most reviews state.  It's 3/4 so it's large, but it's not heavy nor is it that hard to coil.  I only use this with my pressure washing equipment and it works wonderful.  I don't use it for any other purposes."
5.0,I never thought I would gush about a hose but I'll make an exception for this one. It is flexible and doesn't fight me when moving it around. Kinking is not a big problem.
4.0,So far so good! I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now. I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations. I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it.
4.0,It is a good quality hose and came very quickly.  I was looking for something a little more flexible.  It is much better than the hose I bought at Farm and Fleet (and returned) but still a little stiff.  Not the best for winter water fills for my horses.  Still looking for a more flexible hose but no complaints about this one.
5.0,"No hose I've used has been truly unkinkable. This one is close. It is heavier and stiffer than an average hose, but that is to be exepected. It has lasted through several winter freezes with absolutely no damage, and still looks like new."
5.0,I bought this same hose a couple of years ago and it has peformed in an outstanding mannsr.  I can't rate the hose I just purchased as it is a Christmas present and hasn't been opened yet.  John L Pink
4.0,"Doesn't kink, well built and you don't have to worry about poor connections and leaks.  This is a good product."
2.0,Seems like a good hose but the female end blew off at first use. Used a hose clamp to solve issue. Shouldn't have to do this at this price.
5.0,"Actually, as a 3/4 inch hose this is more than I bargained for.  It moves a lot of water - more than the old 5/8 inch, which I thought was very adequate.  It seems strong, and I'm hoping it will live up to expectations."
5.0,cant imagine a more durable hose ... this is my third one...the first i bought still going strong after 20 + years
5.0,"Got a larger hose to deal with high water pressure (125psi static) and maintain water pressure to the end of the line. My water pressure has popped 3 different hoses. Not this one - this hose is thick, can take the pressure, and can handle being dragged around. It is heavy though, so this may not be appropriate for others. I bought a 5/8"" for the back of the house - also holding up to the water pressure"
4.0,"Purchased two hoses and had problems with both of them with the fittings.  With the first use of one of the hoses it  ""blew"" off of the female fitting.  Ended up replacing it as couldn't even crimp metal down enough to keep this from happening.  Then a day or two later the male end of the other hose blew off at house faucet connection.  Replaced it.  The replacements seem to be holding fine."
5.0,"Large thick hose feels sturdy and comes with a lifetime guarantee. Real brass ends, heavy duty. We will see what happens after a season or so."
4.0,Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses. You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..  But I am only giving you 4 stars  because this hose and the 100 footer I bought  a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?
2.0,"Similar bad comments as other reviews. Best to spend your money somewhere else. For a 8 ply 50 foot hose it's not as heavy as one would expect. Easy to kink too for ""8 ply"" hose. And leaks at the faucet connection. I thought they forgot the rubber washer at the faucet connection; nothing on the packaging about their o-ring seal. But like others have said, the o-ring seal leaks before and after I tried a washer. Guess I'll cut the end off and add another. Not very happy with the quality of this hose."
5.0,"This is a heavy-duty hose and it works very well with no leaks or kinks.  It is not lightweight, especially when there is water in it, but it does tend to lay upon the ground in a straight line and does not tend to flip.  It is best used with a hose reel of metal to be sturdy enough to hold the width and length and weight of a hose like this."
5.0,I needed a 3/4 hose  and no one in my area carries anything but 5/8  so I ordered this one  and it comes with a LIFE TIME GURANTEE  can not beat that as I go through hoses like crazy  although I usually by the cheaper ones
5.0,Boy I wasted a lot of money in the past buying other hoses. This is the best one I've got
5.0,I had a crappy hose that kept getting kinks and really was a pain to put away. This one works great. Very few kinks. It's super easy to get out and put away. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hose.
5.0,"Love this hose!  Exceptionally sturdy.  No kinking!  Quality is great!  I would recommend it for everyone.  I needed it for use with my power washer, but love it for all outdoor use."
5.0,"I love using this 50-foof hose since I can get all the outdoor electric tools cleaned up and the car, too.  Also, I can water the plants and the lawn, too. It never gets kinked when I use it.  I would recommend this hose to anyone who needs it."
4.0,"Great Hose, good quality and plenty of capacity.  Is a little tight when trying to coil it but feels like it will last forever"
1.0,"When I first started using this hose  I thought it was great. Heavy duty, etc etc... Now 2 years later it is no longer flexible. Impossible to move around. weighs a ton. its like the material morphed into something else, I couldn't send  this back if i wanted to. awful hose don't buy!"
5.0,"I have purchased and used FLEXOGEN water hoses for over 12 years.  It is the best you can buy, does not kink and if you get the 3/4 inch size, it delivers all the h2o you can use.  Best of all, after eight years of use, one of my hoses malfunctioned (got torn at the end).  I send in the two end pieces of hose and received a brand new one gratis!  Cannot be beat."
5.0,"Got tired of replacing hoses all the time and decided to try a premium product instead of the generic 20$ ones I had been buying.

This hose is fantastic.  It has yet to kink, but still flexible enough to wrangle around the yard without frustration.  It also coils and stores neatly.

I tore part of the end off mine dragging it from the other side of the house. I am not sure if the fitting had a weak spot,  or if i just hulked the thing off the spigot, but it became unusable mighty quickly.

Emailed the manufacturer and they had me chop the 2 ends off and pop them in the mail with a brief note describing the damage. In my case, the damage was apparent, and i had a new hose in 3 business days.

Fantastic customer service, and a great product i would recommend in a heartbeat.  I have 2 more on the way!"
5.0,"I need to fill a large Koi Pond with tap water. I like to have a hose that is easy to handle, won't kink or de-laminate and will roll up easily. This works well and I'm happy, happy, happy."
5.0,"When I received this product, I was very impressed. The hose is good quality and I would recommend it to anyone who is going to buy new hose. I hooked it up outside and used it for the first time and it had a really nice flow of water and no kinks!"
1.0,Do not waste your money on this expensive hose.  It kinked after 4 months and actually ripped after 14 months.  It is three times as much as a standard hose and is a big rip off.
5.0,"This water hose is made of a very solid material. I use it every day. So far is still holding like new.
I would recommend this hose."
4.0,"Great hose, just not so flexible in the cold. It memorizes its shape in the cold months, so uncoiling it is kinda awkward, but no problem in the summer."
2.0,"I expected this to flow much more water as it is larger.  Not so.  I also did not expect it to kink as much.  Gads, it kinks like crazy.  I cannot recommend this hose.  Being larger in diameter I did think I would be more difficult wind up but it is.  Can't tell ya how disappointed I am in this hose.  I cannot recommend it . I would recommend a smaller diameter hose and get a stronger flow and more powerfull flow ... which makes sense, smaller opening makes a stronger flow.  This darn thing kinks like crazy, much, much more than my 75 foot hose.  Don't waste your money."
5.0,Will use this hose until it no longer works.  Love it... And it is USA made.  That is a plus in itself.
1.0,"This hose does not do what it specifically advertises - be flexible. I initially unrolled the hose to find it had 5 permanent kinks. The kinks get caught on things and as I unroll the hose it kinks and shuts off the water.  This is the worst hose I have ever owned.  I returned it and got another and the same thing happened.  I even left the hose stretched-out in the sun to see if that would fix the kinks - it didn't. Dont buy this hose, they are lying - it isn't flexible at all!"
3.0,"While the price was good, this hose seems to have a mind of its own. It's very hard to get it to coil up on the hose rack - it keeps developing weird bends. The end of it was so crimped when it arrived that it's very hard to get it to stand out straight. It keeps wanting to point to the ground no matter what I do. Hopefully, it will soften over time. The choices for 3/4"" hoses is very limited, so for the price, it's as good as any of them seem to get."
5.0,"We have a bigger yard with a need for many hoses.  I purchased one a while back and it has held up so well through the years that this is the only hose I buy.  The 3/4""  100' length hose while big provides plenty of flow rate and minimal pressure loss when compared with some of my older 1/2-5/8"" hoses.

Plus the lifetime warranty is also give you some piece of mind.  Should the hose be defective and need replacement, send the ends in and get a replacement.

A+ on this product"
5.0,"This is one heavy duty, simply great hose. It does deliver significantly more water volume than the typical 5/8 inch hose, but it is significantly heavier!

It coils easily and so far, does not kink.

If you want the best, this is it!"
5.0,"Great hose.  I have a 2 acre yard, and the 3/4"" hose with my Rain Bird 3/4"" sprinkler really cuts down on my watering time."
5.0,I needed 50 feet of 3/4 inch hose to meet the warranty of my new pressure washer.  I could not find this hose anylace in retail stores.  I found it online and it works great and has an excellent warrranty.
5.0,This is very flexible and appears to be very well made. The rubber is pretty thick so it holds its shape (doesn't collapse or kink easily). The fittings on each end don't look like they will break loose from the hose and I've had no leaking issues. I see someone selling a set of washers with the Gilmour name on them so I'll probably pick them up to change them out yearly. Other than that I think this hose will last forever. I'll probably end up getting a few more longer ones for this yard.
4.0,"While I haven't used it a lot yet, this hose seems well made, and is fairly kink resistant.
What I really like about it is the 'full flow' fittings.  I needed all the flow I could get, and unlike some hoses I have looked at, the fittings are not a restriction.  About the only trade off I can see, is that it takes an o-ring at the fitting, instead of the standard hose gasket."
5.0,"Excellent worth the price. Very well made and does not kink.
Does not work well on regular hose reels due the 3/4 diameter of the hose."
5.0,"I am extremely happy with this hose. I don't what I have been waiting on all these years to buy an actual 3/4"" hose instead of those wimpy 1/2"" or 5/8"" hoses I have previously owned. I will never go back to anything but a full 3/4"" hose. The hose itself seems to be of good quality, but it will take several years before I know for sure what the quality is."
5.0,"Climate change has kept us varying our irrigation routine every year. Over the last three years we have bought 10 Gilmour hoses. They have been nearly kink free. Only had any problems with one, which was promptly replaced by the manufacturer. Best hose we've ever bought."
5.0,"I got the 3/4 inch 100 foot hose, and it replaced the previous one that was a 5/8 inch hose that I had for 28 years.  The hose I had for 28 years did not fail.  It was damaged by a lawn mower, and still in perfect condition, other than the fact that it was damaged by a lawn mower, and I never had a problem with kinks of any kind.  At first I though that the 3/4 inch hose might not fit my standard water connection, on the outside of the house, but that was not a problem at all due to both ends being the same size as a 5/8 inch hose.  Bottom line is that you will not be disappointed with either the 5/8 or the 3/4 inch hose.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a perfect hose."
1.0,These hoses suck!  Bought two. Used one twice and had to trash it. Pressure decreased greatly and has multiple bulges. Second one did the same the first time we used it!
4.0,Would order again. Second one I've had. This one is for my back yard. I will order another one later this summer.
4.0,This is a great water hose. no kinks which is what i was looking for. Be aware that its a big hose as in big around and it takes a lot of effort to pull it around when watering flowers or using with pressure washer. it will wear you out!!!!! KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS HOSE FOR YOUR WIFE or an old man like me! still a great hose and if it were not so hard to drag around i would give it 5 stars.
5.0,"The 3/4"" Gilmour hose is the only hose I buy today for use on our farm - rugged, great capacity, flexible and guaranteed. Beats the big box cheapie hoses by a mile, and with free shipping, the pricing is very competetive."
5.0,"I saw this hose at our local garden nursery and could tell it was well built.  I've purchased Swan lifetime hoses in 5/8 over the years and they have served us well.  Yet, many of the ends have separated requiring repair.  I didn't buy the hoses from our nursery because they were priced almost double what Amazon listed them for.  We always prefer to support our local trades, but the high price was too much to take.  I had a 3/4 rubber hose which moved the water quite fast, however it was a pain to use and especially when rolling it back up on the hose cart.  These Flexogen 3/4 hoses maneuver and roll up like a good quality 5/8 hose, very easy.  The ends are substantial and look like it would be nearly impossible to separate from the hose.  I plan on purchasing three more 50 ft hoses from Amazon.  The Gilmour Flexogen hoses come in 75 and 100 ft lengths, but I prefer the flexibility of the 50 footers (no pun intended)."
5.0,"I just received this hose.  I've only used it a few times over the past few days but so far I am very impressed.  It really feels substantial and I like the large diameter.  The real test will be whether it becomes prone to kinks over time.  I have my fingers crossed.

Update, I think it's been a couple years.  Still my favorite hose.  High volume, resists kinking (but still does occasionally) and it doesn't have a mind of its own like most hoses do.  It rolls up into a neat circle without a fight.  Still love it and will buy only these from now on.

Further update, still in great shape.  No kinks, still easy to handle (doesnt have a mind of its own).  Buying another 100 footer now."
5.0,"Flexogen are consistantly the best hoses I have ever used. Any hose can be kinked, but the eight ply resists it while remaining relatively supple. For the few people who encounter leaky ends, my advice is to take Gilmore up on their lifetime warrantee. Few companies stand by their products as well as the Gilmore Flexogen. I am proud to support American workers."
5.0,"I live in a rural, mountain area served by a volunteer fire department: through no fault of theirs, if I suffered a fire, my house would burn to the ground before they arrived. With that in mind, I purchased three of these hoses (150 feet) to which I attached a high pressure, fireman's-style nozzle<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nelson-50503-High-Pressure-Rated-Fireman-s-Style-Industrial-Spray-Nozzle-with-Large-On-Off-Lever/dp/B0015AUOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nelson 50503 High-Pressure Rated Fireman's Style Industrial Spray Nozzle with Large On/Off Lever</a>. My water pressure tank operates at 40-60 PSI and, in conjunction with this hose/nozzle, puts out about 10 GPM, i.e., gives me a fighting chance.

The hose is quite sturdy, obviously scuff/tear resistant, and does not easily kink. The brass fittings are designed to not restrict the water flow into the hose, thus permitting maximum water flow. The nozzle features compliment those of the hose. After 2.5 years of exposure, the hose shows no sign of deterioration whatsoever.

Given the performance of this hose/nozzle combination, I think most people would find it far superior to 1/2- or 5/8-inch household hose applications.

Ed"
5.0,Great for short distance sewage pumping in all types of weather and due to the quality should last for several years.
5.0,"I have purchased several hoses in the past. Hardware store boughten, box store boughten, now I realize what a waste of money they were.. I purchased this in good faith of the positive reviews on Amazon. This hose delivers. Easy to coil, literally no kinks. You'd think such a thick hose would be hard to coil but that is not the case with this hose. Definitely recommended..."
5.0,"Update: I purchased this hose in 2011 (when it used to be available in green).  Now 7 years later, it is still in great shape!  This is the only hose that Ive been able to use for such a long time that did not develop any kinks.  The material stays soft, yet tough, and remembers its original shape.  Heres a photo after 7 years of heavy use & abuse.

Original review:
After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2"" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8"", but this is 3/4"".

There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:

I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4"" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2"" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter."
5.0,This is the best hose I have ever purchased.  It never kinks!  It is easy to take off the hose hanger and hang back up.  I have now purchased two of these.
1.0,had a pin hole the first time i used. cut the couplers off and mailed them back to gilmore for free replacement 2 weeks ago still recieved nothing. this hose has 2 plys of rienforcement how they can say it is 8 plys is just not true.
5.0,"If you need a garden hose this summer, this is the best brand out of the many I have tried. Very durable and never kinks. Hoses that kink drive me nuts!"
5.0,Works well and is lightweight. Money well spent
1.0,I loved this hose when I got it about a month ago. However now it started to leak where the brass nut is connected to the hose I don't know why it started to leak. After spending $63.00 on this hose I thought it would last longer VERY VERY disappointed. Where it leaks is part of the hose not something that was placed on it.
2.0,"I bought this to use on our hobby farm for watering livestock.  The hose itself is robust and relatively kink free - in fact all I would expect.  However we are returning it because of a worsening and persistent leak at the rotating connection between the female end on the faucet end of the hose and the hose itself. It started the first time we used the hose with just a few drops of leakage but now half fills a 5 gallon pail every day while we fill stock tanks. I am disappointed because I thought I was finally going to find a reliable 3/4 inch hose and while I think I am just unfortunate to have got one with a faulty fitting, I am going to try a different hose next time."
1.0,"When I received the hose, I made sure to unroll it completely. The first time the water was turned on, the hose had a pin hole in it. Now I have to go through the process of rolling it back up to return it. Not worth the effort. Thankfully amazon.com has a good return policy."
5.0,Not much to review. Sits outside year after year and looks as good today as the day I purchased it. Good product.
1.0,Only after few weeks I got to notice a few dents and a tear in the pipe. Will check if a replacement can be made.
5.0,It does the job. A bit heavy with water in it. It is high quality.
5.0,"If you are going to run a hose any distance over 100 feet, you will get significantly more volume and pressure with a 3/4 inch hose.  I have several brands of 3/4 inch hose.  This Gilmour Flexogen hose is head and shoulders over the rest.  It is expensive to buy any brand in comparison to 5/8 inch, but worth it.  If you need the capacity and can afford THE BEST then this is the lifetime investment you will not regret."
5.0,"Gilmore makes a wonderful hose. Yes, it is expensive, but they will replace it for free, for life. It withstands all kinds of abuse, rarely kinks, and is highly durable. We have six of these durable hoses and would recommend this manufacturer to everyone."
5.0,"As it says on the package, the last hose you will ever buy.
You cant go wrong, it stays flexible in cold weather and the 3/4"" delivers water a lot better than the 5/8"" type."
4.0,This hose is very good although because of its larger diameter it kinks a little easier.  If the hose ever fails they replace it for free. Really nice quality and great guarantee.
1.0,"I ordered and received this hose and it arrived with one end of the hose being severely ""bent"". It definitely would have restricted water flow.

So, I returned the hose and reordered it soon after, thinking the defective first hose was simply a fluke. The second hose arrived in same manner - bent about 4 inches below the coupling. I need to look elsewhere..."
5.0,"I searched several hose manufacturers and checked Home Depot, OSH, Lowes and other retailers to see what was available.  Wanted a large diameter, commercial grade quality hose, and this had a lifetime warranty!  The rubber is soft and it does not kink or bind.  I exect to get many years from this hose, and I have no complaints.  It is by far the best hose I have owned."
5.0,"I have a 25' 5/8"" hose and was so impressed by the quality that I had to purchase this one. Though I haven't had it for years, exposed to the elements, I'm confident in saying that I can see this lasting years. The hose is thick in construction and as such doesn't really kink. The weight isn't terrible, but it can be difficult to drag under pressure. The couplings are top notch. Best of all, this product is made in USA. The warranty, which I haven't used, seems to be no nonsense as well."
5.0,"This 3/4 inch hose is a quality product and the free shipping from
Amazon made it an economical purchase compared to other retailers.
I'll probably buy more of these hoses in 3/4 inch size soon."
5.0,"You probably don't want a 3/4"" hose for watering the plants and whatnot, but for sprinklers and other applications where you want a lot of flow and don't drag the hose around too much it is ideal.  I bought one of these to replace a 5/8"" hose from the local garden center that runs across our driveway to a big sprinkler.  The old hose was a few years old and finally cracked where we drive over it.  This one has been there for about 6 months now and shows no sign of breaking down so far."
5.0,"I live in Northern Nevada and it is winter right now. I received the hose about two weeks ago. I have only used it once to fill my hot tub. Since it arrived tightly rolled up I have it laid out straight on the ground right now so I can roll it up without it bunching up. I liked the way it felt, the metal ends look solid and the water flow was great. There is not much else I can say about it other than right now my perception of the hose is that it is better than the hoses I had before."
5.0,"So far, so good.  Haven't had any complaints with this hose yet.  If your looking for a garden hose for watering the yard or washing the car, look no further.  Just make sure that 50 ft is all you need, it sounds like a long length, but I had to use another hose along with this one to wash cars in the front of the house ( my hose is in the back yard)."
5.0,"Difficult to find in stores, this Gilmour garden hose is top notch and a quality item.  Very difficult to kink, but very flexible and relatively easy to handle.  The 3/4"" inner diameter size helps with providing optimum flow rate, making water the lawn faster in duration.  The time and frustration you save pays for this hose many times over.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"Just a quick review: We bought a couple of these hoses in 1999 and they have been in use and kept outside in the Southern California sun continuously for 9 years. The hoses are in perfect condition! Based on how long they last, they are also the cheapest hoses ever. We had to replace one because a construction crew drove over it repeatedly with a bulldozer, but that's hardly normal use. The Flexogen hoses are also much lighter than most high quality hoses. Highly recommended."
5.0,"The difference is so measurable from others that I'm back to buy another as gift, seriously!

I have the 50 ft, and yes, this hose is heavy weight however, the quality and performance is greater than I've ever experienced with a consumer level hose (as opposed to industrial level I've used in food processing environment). You'll love the volume of water that this thing delivers making wash down much quicker, more efficient. As for the garden, cuts my watering time there too.  Get it, you'll not regret it. I would also strongly recommend a hose reel, and a heavier duty one at that, for anyone purchasing the 100ft.

This will be the only one I'll be dropping my money on anymore.

UPDATE APRIL 7, 2012
This hose is still in use and is in excellent condition. I purchased it in 2008, and it has been outside the whole time. I've never done anything to protect it from sun, rain, freeze etc. I still enjoy the extra water pressure because it is a larger diameter, in fact, the difference in pressure is quite significant compared to the standard diameter hoses. Get this hose, you will not regret it, you will get spoiled by it. Happy shopping!"
5.0,Don't waste your money on Home Depot garbage. My experience is that even their most expensive hoses leak and tangle. This hose is very well manufactured - you will feel the quality if you compare it to what you get from a home center.
4.0,"This is a good hose, but not the best hose I have owned. I have it hooked to water hydrants in my yard that are off my irrigation mains and I like the 3/4 inch for a super flow of water for cleaning, quicker watering, etc. The single drawback is that it easily kinks and shuts off the water flow. The good part though is that when the kink is straightened out, the kink disappears. My best ever hose is a black rubber Sears hose that is 40 years old and it doesn't kink and is still in great working order, has solid brass fittings, etc., so in having one like this, I want a repeat product, especially for the money that this Gilmour hose costs."
5.0,"I bought two of these 100 foot hoses because they can withstand high pressure and hooked them together, laid them on my carport roof and use them as a solar water pre-heater. We're in a mild climate and have saved over $20/month on natural gas. Haven't had the water heater start up in 3 months because the solar heated water is at 135 F and the heater is set for 125 F."
5.0,"Quit buying all of those dinky, knotting, kinking types, and go for this. We have 3 of the 100' lengths and are very happy."
4.0,"I recently bought the 100 foot 3/4"" hose from Amazon based upon my previous experience with a 50 foot 5/8"" Gilmour Flexogen hose I've had for half a dozen years.  I've gotten lazy in recent years and leave my hoses outside even in our -20F (or worse) upstate NY winters. (I don't use the hoses in sub-freezing weather, but I don't bring them in, either). Of the three different brands of supposedly ""premium"" hoses I own, only the Gilmour Flexogen has held up unaffected by this use and abuse.
When I looked for a longer hose that could sevice the far reaches of my gardens, I did not hesitate to go for the 3/4"" Flexogen since I knew that the supple flexibilty and non-kinking qualities of the shorter Flexogen would be even more important qualities in a longer, higher capacity hose.  Oh, by-the-way, the price a Amazon was the best I could find, too."
5.0,"First, I am always amazed at Amazon's shipping speed. Lightning quick...always. I purchased the 100 foot hose because of the size of our yard. Usually I hook up more than one to reach to the end. This Gilmour hose is outstanding. I have been using it every day for a month now and the 3/4 inch diameter makes the water flow. Moving the hose around so much all around my yard, usually they get kinked and worse. This hose just does not kink. I will get another one, or two for the back yard next year. The only drawback personally for me is of course the price, but as the old saying goes, 'you get what you pay for'. I got a really nice hose."
5.0,"This is a great product. Fittings are superb and this beauty really delivers the water. I bought the 3/4"" because of the long length; has less pressure drop. The Amazon price couldn't be beat either, plus the free shipping...."
5.0,"This garden hose does what others claim but don't do: it does not kink. It may not be the lowest in cost, but it appears to be the best value for your money. Well constructed at the two ends, too! I am happy with it."
1.0,Hooked it up to the faucet to wash my wife's car and got sprayed in the face from the middle of the hose.
5.0,"1.  Incredible flow available!

2.  All that flow works great to clean stuff!

3.  All that flow works great for watering the garden too!

4.  Seems to have a smell the dog doesn't like---he doesn't chew it!

I will buy more like this in the future.  No more 5/8"" hoses for me."
1.0,"This review is for the Gilmour 10-34100 Flexogen - 3/4"" x 100' hose. If it is critical or important to maintain water flow, then pass on this hose. The Flow Guard Plus collar is NOT part of this hose. Amazon's web page incorrectly pictures and describes the product as having the kink resistant collar. I need to supply water to a 4 gpm pressure washer. Uninterrupted water flow is critical for this application. Therefore, I am returning the hose. Also, be advised the Amazon tools-tech-support department assured me this hose has the collar. They were wrong."
4.0,"You will not find a better made hose. My guess is that this hose will last forever. I gave this 4 stars because the hose is so thick, the 100' I purchased would not fit on my 250 foot hose reel. So I purchased the hose on a Friday sale deal from Amazon at a discount, but then needed to buy an industrial size hose reel to carry the hose."
5.0,"I previously purchased a Gilmour Flexogen hose (at a Retail store years ago) and loved it. I wanted one in a 3/4"" but couldn't find it anywhere until I logged onto Amazon. I purchased the 3/4"" X 100 and it arrived quickly, in good condition. I've used it now for weeks and I'm very pleased with it. The free shipping was great! Not only did I receive a good price on the hose, I didn't have to pay to have it shipped, and the shipping didn't seem to take any longer than had I paid for it, so I feel like an all-around winner on this deal!"
5.0,It is cheaper to buy this hose the first time than any of the less expensive competitive versions. This one lasts and doesn't kink.  It works in very cold environments including the mountains of Colorado.  Our previous one lasted over 15 years before being chewed and destroyed by a black bear.
3.0,"I got this hose because a deal site I subscribe to exploited a price mistake on it and I bagged it for $5 + shipping from Amazon, so hell of a deal.  It's a heavy duty hose no doubt and that may be good for some applications.  However if you don't have the pressure to really take advantage of a hose like that, then what's the point?  I have good pressure in my house; however the water lines for the spigots use "" hose line from the main, so up scaling to "" hose is kind of mute.  It's much heavier than a 5/8 hose of the same length so be careful of those small shrubs or you'll decapitate them when dragging it around.

Only other complaint I have is leakage, which is really annoying especially when it's cold out.  The problem isn't the gasket or my spray heads, it's at the hose ends and it leaks between the threads and the hose itself.  It leaks at both ends no matter how tight I have it.  So this aspect really annoys me.

Not knocking it especially for the price I paid, however I wouldn't have paid $30 on this hose as its just overkill for what I need.  If I had to do it all over again I'd rather have a 100' 5/8"" hose as I just don't see the point of having anything wider, again unless you have the pressure to take advantage of it.

In the end, good sturdy & rugged hose that will last many years.  3 out of 5, mainly because of the leaking.  If I'd spent $30 on a hose, I'd expect it not to leak a drop..."
5.0,"This is easily the best garden hose I've ever owned.  Very flexible but strong, almost never kinks, I can see getting years of use out of this one.  Also note that Amazon's pricing is about $30-40 less than you'll see in many catalogs carrying the same hose."
4.0,"GPM increases exponentially with hose diameter, so the 3/4"" size is a must have in the yard.  Gilmour warrantees the hose for life with a very simple return policy, cut the ends, and send them in.  Amazon has this 3/4"" hose for less than most offer the 5/8""!  Great buy for a great, well backed product."
3.0,I had this hose now for two weeks and cant believe how great it is. You won't be dissapointed in buying one of these fantastic hoses.
5.0,"Being a 1st time homeowner I had to buy all the necessary things for my home.  One of those things were Hoses.  Needless to say I didn't buy this hose at 1st.  My 1st hose was the magna ""as seen on tv"" flat hose.  Sounded great but worked like a dud and the hose pressure was very poor.  So then I decided to buy the best quality hose and just call it day.  I purchased the flexogen based on the specs and reviews.
I am happy to say I will not be buying anymore hoses from now on.  The flexogen is top notch and would recommend to all 1st time home buyers."
4.0,This is a very good quality water hose that I expect to be able to use for several years. The hose is black in color and that may not be preferred by some.
5.0,"I purchased this spreader for my acreage.  It works well.  It does take some time to assemble, but is not difficult.  It has two tabs that can be used to block the flow of the substance on the holes in the bottom of the spreader.  I didn't notice they were closed until I was done fertilizing the yard.  It did explain why I had extra fertilizer.  The manual is sparse and did not comment on the use of these to customize your pattern (the information is on their website).  Overall, this is a great machine, well built.  It rolls easily and holds 50# of material.  This is significantly better than the typical store bought units."
1.0,Bought this product to salt my side walks. The product is hard to put together and is doesn't work. The black disk that is supposed to distribute the rock salt well stop spinning and the salt just piles up on the disk. The third time I used it the wheel fell off. Not worth it disappointed for the money spent.
5.0,"After researching the crappy $20.00 lawn spreaders at the big box stores, I decided to upgrade some.  Problem is, the $40.00 spreaders, while twice as much money and only half as crappy are still, well, crappy.  Digging a little further I came upon this piece, which, while a little spendy, seemed like it would fit the bill nicely.  My yard is very hilly (not to be confused with Hillary) and the angled, padded grips and pnuematic tires are a big plus in this department.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this purchase and should you fork over the coin for this item, I don't believe you'll regret it.  Besides, if you're anything like me, I'm burning through the kids inheritance as fast as I can, so this is likely to be the only thing they'll get in the end.  I'm sure they'll be thrilled."
4.0,"Very good product, pleased with the discription, but you will NOT get a hopper cover for this, so do not assume that the picture is what you get."
5.0,"This is a very well-constructed piece of equipment.  It glides across even the bumpiest lawn thanks to the large, inflated wheels.  It takes a bit of time to assemble, but the instructions are clear.  My only complaint/recommendation is that I wish the manufacturer included a better spreader settings manual because a lot of the popular lawn treatment products (especially the Scotts products) provide setting information only for Scotts spreaders.  The included spreader settings sheet helps you make the conversions, but it could be beefed up with more helpful information.  I think this oversights reflects the fact that Earthway caters primarily to the commercial market and doesn't think like a consumer company.  Still, all in all you'll be happy with this spreader if you're willing to spend the money.  It should last many years."
5.0,"I just used it the first time.  I have 3 other spreaders in various states of disintegration in the shed or garage.  This works great and is worth the money.  I especially like that you have the option of extending the handle to a longer length.  I am 6 feet tall and it seems that the spreaders are made for 5 ft 6 inch people so you have to bend over while walking with the spreader.  The directions lack some specifics on assembling the gauge.  I highly recommend you go to YouTube, type in the model number of the spreader and watch the video on assembling."
5.0,"This spreader is a bit overkill for most residential applications under 1/2 acre.  It is big and heavy compared to typical spreaders found in most big hardware stores and will take up space in your garage.  However, if you decide to buy one for personal use, it will likely be the last spreader you will ever buy.  The bolts are stainless as is the axle.  The frame is steel so if it is used for salting, it will likely eventually rust without regular cleaning and preventive maintenance.  The bucket and wheel hubs are heavy plastic and are very sturdy, as expected for an advertised professional unit.  The wheels are big and roll easily over dense grass and irregular lawn surfaces.  Overall, a very well-designed spreader."
4.0,"I definitely recommend this spreader, but I demote it to 4 stars for a couple of reasons that shouldn't stop you from buying it.  The small criticisms of it that I have are (1) the assembly instructions aren't easy to follow in places, (2) the design makes it very difficult to spread the smaller of the two cotter pins used to hold the wheels on the axle, and (3) the matrix showing the suggested spread rate was not even close to what I found as being appropriate.

But this is a great spreader once you have it assembled, and once you figure out what settings you want to use for a typical granular fertilizer.  The adjustments to limit the pattern to one side or the other work well.  The application is also very broad and reasonably uniform if you don't limit the pattern to one side or the other.  And you can (and should) walk fast with this spreader, which allows you to get the job done very quickly.  Although I've only had it a short time now, it's construction appears to be very sound and solid.  I'm happy with the purchase and it might last the rest of my life."
2.0,"Appears to be of quality build.  Unfortunately the box was missing the usual bag that contains ALL of the nuts, bolts, washers, screws, etc. The shipping box was factory sealed and un-opened.

I called Earthway and a nice customer service rep is taking care of shipping out the missing parts, but still...that's a pretty big quality control miss."
4.0,"Very good product overall. The supplier packaging was poor, parts were placed in a box without any packaging material. Instructions for assembly were poorly written. Be prepared to spend well over an hour for assembly. Earthway needs to focus more on their product assembly manuals."
5.0,"This certainly is a professional machine Great quality. Loved the detail regarding protecting the paint and metal finish/protection  when assembling.
This shows that the manufacturer is proud of his product and expects it to last for many years. Also has good instructions for measuring and spreading details ----Certainly looks as though it will last for a long time."
5.0,received on time haven't had a chance to use. assembly was fairly easy.takes about an hour to assemble.
5.0,Loved this broadcaster.  Works really well.
3.0,"1. Plastic gear box
2. Insufficient instructions
3. Product arrived with scratches
4. Marketing this product as commercial/professional grade seems misleading to me."
5.0,Heavy duty and easy for this old man to push on a hill!
2.0,Good quality but rusted badly after a few uses
4.0,Just what I needed. Gears make a little noise and is my only concern. Seams tight. Might just be me.
3.0,"The spreader itself is great (so far), and not as hard to put together as some of the reviews suggest.  The packaging however was poor (it almost looked like Amazon sent a returned item.)  The box that the spreader came in had no dividers or internal spacers to keep the parts from banging together.  The package was literally a box of painted pipes bouncing off of one another.  Too much of a hassle to return -- I just touched up all of the dings, nicks, and scratches."
5.0,"After many years of using the cheap ones and throwing them away, I researched and found this one. After reading the reviews I decided to go with it. More than happy with my purchase. The calibrations are the only challenge, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to get it figured out

Make this your last spreader purchaseyou'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner."
5.0,Purchased this a few years back for my husband for Christmas.  He LOVES it.  Purchased another one for my son in law this past Christmas.  HE LOVES it.  Very easy to use.  Holds a lot and spreads evenly.  Both have told me more than once that they love this spreader so if a man tells you more than once he loves something...He LOVES it!!!
5.0,"Well built. I'm not a professional but look to buy quality tools. Appears that it will last many years. It rolls very well over rough terrain. I first used it to spread salt, which the manufacturer does not recommend, it worked very well."
3.0,"It is OK, but not what I was expecting.  The instructions are very poor and one of the cotter pins to hold one of the wheels was EXTREMELY difficult to bend.  Spreading mechanism is not very good and the steel tubing was scratched and chipped on arrival.  I would not buy this product again."
4.0,"The Earthway spreaderis a professional looking product once constructed ,  The only concern I had was the thread on the calibration rod .  It was at it's last thread closest to the lever control end of the spreader .  In the video , it appears closer to the middle or distal end of the threaded rod .  Bob at Earthway assured me this was not a concern just as long as it opens and closes all the way with the lever .  I need more experience to determine the spread of materials applied as I ended up using somewhat more than recommended on each bag .  Grass is growing so not too far off .  I may need to call Bob back about the lever rod because there are times when I reopen the hopper after ending a length of coverage that the distribution of materials appears to change to a lesser degree until I bounce the unit several times to continue distributing the materials ?
May need new rod ?  Otherwise the spreader is professional/durable quality and easy to maneuver with the large tires .
Far better than my old Scotts Rotary Spreader ."
5.0,I've been looking to pick this spreader for up a while now and once I saw it at this deal I couldn't pass it up - This by far is the best value you for the money on the market - Thank You Amazon for the great price :-)
5.0,"1/4 acre sloped but well manicured weed free lawn.  Used Scott's broadcast spreader from big box store.  Functional yes.  Durable and well built?  NO.  Considering it was the only option readily available for purchase at the time when I needed a spreader, I purchased it and put it through three years of service.  It did the job, its downfall however was difficulty in navigating hilly terrain and capacity beyond a 40LB bag.  Also if you tipped the spreader just right at the start, you would spill material and have a burn spot on the lawn.  Dealt with it and began researching the perfect, commercial grade spreader to add to my repertoire.

Enter Earthway C24HD.  I was read to purchase the C22HD at about $275.00 and then I stumbled on this absolute steal for $130.00.  100LB capacity, same professional construction for more than $100.00 less??? Who could resist.

Package arrived via buster brown promptly and in perfect condition.

I unpackaged all parts.  My complaints regarding the assembly are due to the lack of easy to follow instructions.  The parts list does not specify quantity of the different size bolts (easily remedied by measuring).  At times the instructions are a little unclear.

Ever the less, after two hours, common sense, and a couple of beers I assembled the Earthway C24HD.  Also, words of wisdom.  I used an appropriately sized deep well nut driver on the nut end and a socket mated to my Dewalt impact for easy and quick assembly. Obviously don't go crazy on impact usage.

Calibration is simple and explained in the instruction manual.

As far as adjusting disperse rates, Earthway provides two simple tables to use.  Most fertilizers provide and coverage rates.  Scotts Summerguard is 2.7LB per 1000 sq ft.  Earthway tells you to round up to 3LB per 1000 sq ft and then that provides equivalent Earthway setting.  Not rocket science by any means.

This thing is huge.  I mean it is almost as big as a Volkswagen.  You could use it as a shopping cart at Costco. Seriously.  And I say that in a good way.  I quickly loaded it  with 50 lbs. of granular material.  What a positive difference over the inferior Scott's plastic spreader.  This machine easily navigates the terrain with little effort.  Ergonomics are outstanding.  Start / stop lever is thoughtfully placed.  Spreading of material is superb.  I did not mess with the adjustable side spread dampers however I assume they work flawlessly as well.

This is a solidly constructed quality spreader.  You can have a professional quality spreader at a homeowner price.  This could quite possibly be the last spreader you will need to purchase.  Quality is superb.  For the shortcomings in the instruction manual, I easily am willing to overlook those minor issues and endorse this product with a glaring 5 star review.

The only minor issue I had with performance came near the end when the hopper became empty.  Material did not want to free fall from the hopper to the rotating mechanism used for broadcasting material.  At that point hopefully you were complete with your entire property and the little left was just added bonus for the easment / neighbor / etc as dispersement was sporadic.

Purchase again?  YES"
2.0,"Well 1st of all, this blow-up Owl dose not keep the chickens away from walking on my solar panels!
2nd I was kind of disappointed in it's construction..
The air hole kept giving me problems with the plug not staying in/sealing
the blow-up hole.. It kept popping out & not because of to much pressure either : (
 Anyway it's holding air now, due to a little super glue applied to the plug to secure it."
5.0,"This ""owl"" is a great deterrent for birds who want to eat your garden! I was afraid it would look too much like a blow up doll, but it is really quite life-like. The paint is very detailed of the plumage. The horns and beak are wonderful. I especially liked how its feet are constructed. They attach to your desired location in the way a real bird would sit or hold on to something. Unlike those plastic or ceramic hawk and owl statues, it also moves slightly in the wind. So it looks more lifelike, than a still statue. All in all, we really liked this, and thought it helped scare away predators effectively."
1.0,"Let me start out by saying that I did not buy this product for its intended purpose, so I can't speak to its effectiveness as a scarecrow.  But even as a decoration, this was ineffective.  Aside from looking more like a brown beach ball than an owl, the main problem was that the valve stem would not stay closed.  At first, I thought I had overinflated it, but even with minimal inflation, the valve stem would pop open.  I ended up using a binder clip to pinch the top closed.  I would not buy this product again."
5.0,"This inflatable owl is everything I've always dreamed of. It is both great AND horned. Its rubbery plumage is smooth to the touch and its extra-large beak provides bonus visual pleasure. It is a gentle and loving owl, a faithful companion, and an excellent bath toy. Having been on the receiving end of its sweet talony caresses, I can assure potential buyers that they will surely not be disappointed. This inflatable predator is worth every penny."
5.0,Prompt service and the product is exactly what I needed and was described as. Will use your service again.  Thank you.  JB
3.0,well it inflated... and the pigeon's didn't seem to care.  I guess i have some hardened pigeons.
5.0,Happy with it!  Love the useful height of the handles and strong positive close/open.  Takes time to get used to figure out the spreading rate.  Instructions were only OK.  Customer Service only called back the *next day* - by then I had figured it out.  Suggestion for any broadcast spreader. get a several small cones or thin driveway markers to help you accurately put down the product.
2.0,"This would be a really nice product if they fix the inability to adjust the flow of product when the hopper is full.  The lever works great until you put anything in the hopper that puts weight on the part that moves to adjust flow.  I have contacted Earthway via email and explained my issue to see if there is a fix...if not I will be sending it back.  The instructions address the issues so clearly it is not an unknown problem.  They say to keep the area clean so I get it spotless but still I am unable to adjust once product is in the hopper.

8-17-13 Update

Got the replacement part from Earthway and took the unit all apart to install it, which was time consuming, only to experience the exact problem again. Contracted and informed Eathway of the issue and asked them to replace the unit with something that they know for a fact works properly.  The VP of sales who I had worked with indicated they would not do a replacement; he did offer to send me a new hoper system that has not yet hit the market and I'd have to retro fit it, which I did not want to do.  Since I had passed the period Amazon allows to return items, trying to work things out with Earthway, I went to Amazon and explained what I had gone through and Amazon made an exception taking the unit back and giving me a full refund.  Thank you Amazon!

Earthway makes very nice spreader but the C22HD is junk and I would stay away from it.

5 stars to Amazon 0  stars to Earthway C22HD."
5.0,Spreader is very well built and easy to push.  Material doesn't seem to spread as far when the spreader is getting close to empty.  Instructions on the variable opening options needs to be clearer.
5.0,Best broadcast spreader I have ever used. I got tired of replacing my spreader every year or two. This is an excellent product and will last for years.
5.0,After reading many reviews I found the stainless version to be the best choice for me. I see very little that could go wrong with the C22HDS. Amazon is my first choice but I was only able to find this version at one seller found on the web. I'm very pleased with Earthway in making such a solid spreader. Check out your options to see how long you want your spreader to last. C22HDS will last many more years than the C22HD making the price difference no big deal. Both will do the same job but one will outlast the other. I have bought the last spreader I'll ever buy!!!
3.0,"Kind of flaky the way it assembles, and as much as was spent on it it should of had a better finish, like powder coated instead of a clear coat of paint on steal, works well and time will tell."
5.0,"I have been through several cheap spreaders from the home remodel stores and all of them were made to last about 1 or 2 seasons, I have a fairly large yard approx 1/2 acre so I wanted something that would last more than 2 years and if something did break I could get replacement parts. This is truly a pro model very well made has stainless steel bolts and nuts, axle etc. comfortable to push and excellent spread pattern. I actually used less product and seemed to coer better and more uniform so I say this one great spreader."
4.0,"My husband purchased this item. It works pretty good. It is easier to push since it has the wider wheels. The only thing that didn't work too great was the pin that spins in the hopper to move the seed,fertilizer etc. He had to make a pin that was a little larger . Now it works better. It holds the 50lbs. as stated. It did take awhile to put together. Not the easiest thing to do!"
5.0,"very comfortable to push, covers a wide area. It took me 2hr+ to assemble it. If you don't want to assemble it find a local dealer."
4.0,Seems to be well built and with the adjustable handle bars that is is plus for a taller person. Insturctions are ok but could use some improvement. All in all worth the money
4.0,"I brougth this pump not long ago and is already broken someway the pipe were the tread stars just broke, don't know if the water had to do anything with this or just it was defective, I have used several of them in three ponds that my boss has, they work 24/7 and until now every one of them lasted a couple of years, but not this one. I guess You can take Your chances with the brand I don't know many good brand of this little pumps.
  M. G."
5.0,"Purchased this pump to circulate my solar heater water. I am using this in
a small greenhouse. Pump is powered by solar cells through an inverter.
very dependable product."
4.0,"Shipment was prompt and as specified.  As to the pump, it works fine so far, but is not the most powerful.  I have a 5 foot high waterfall with a pond that is about 6 X 4 feet and about a foot deep.  I would have bought a pump that is at least twice as powerful.  I did write the vendor to see if I could make an exchange for another model, but they never replied."
5.0,Best name in pond equipment and Amazon had the best price.  Even better than The Home Depot!
5.0,I've had a small garden pond for 10 years and a Beckett pump has always been my source to keep the water moving.
5.0,"My smaller pond pump failed after 5 years, so I purchased the next larger size Beckett pump (325 gals/medium ponds). Delivery through Amazon was very prompt, but the pump was defective. I contacted the Beckett company and they promptly shipped a new pump. Their customer service was great to work with! The new pump is in the garden pond and working quite well."
5.0,"I have used this pump in my 4' diameter pond with fountain statue in the center.  The inlet on my lotus flower statue is 3/8"".  The outlet on the pump is 1/2"" so I have a reducer.  I also have a flow restricter on the line so I can adjuct the flow which is acceptable.  It will give a nice dispersed spray a foot+ in the air on my statue.  It has worked fine since 1998 and just died after 8 years of near continuous running.  I got it at Home Depot & they still sell it for about 50. I'm going to buy another identical one. I have it in the Beckett filter box model MFB235 with foam filter.  My pond has fish and is under a tree so the filter box has kept the crud out of the pump.  I'm not always good on regular filter cleaning and at times the flow has almost been starved to the pump. But with out the filter I would be cleaning the pump inlet screen all the time in my application."
5.0,"The intake tends to clog with this pump. When you have it in your pond, keep it in a milk crate with wire mesh around it to allow water to pass but not weeds, bugs, and other small objects that can severly hinder its  operation"
4.0,"I am using this pump in a small pond with a small waterfall - it is a strong, hard-working pump and works just fine in this application.  I wouldn't recommend it for a big pond, but for the smaller one it works  great.  My ""pond"" is only 2 ft X 4 ft and I don't have the pump  turned all the way up to full force."
5.0,"I've tried a few things, and this is the best.  Kept the cardinal from attacking his reflection in the window..  Keeps the birds from defacing my deck.  This inflatable owl is the only thing I've found that works.  The plastic owls are useless, the other scare crow objects are failures too.  It's funny to see birds fly around the house looking for a place to perch, and then keep on going after spotting this.  It even keeps my tree free of nests that's a good 25+ feet away."
5.0,"Great for the price, had trouble getting to hold air but some electrical tape to hold the plug shut worked wonders! Seems to be working excellent."
3.0,My mom has one in her yard to keep the LA parrots away from the house.  I'm in temporary housing right now and some annoying birds have just moved in so I thought I would try the owl.  When I first got this I couldn't get the plug to stay in.  It kept popping out and didn't really fit into the valve hole.  I left it sitting out a couple days and one day the birds were driving me nuts in the morning (I didn't order a 4am wake up call).  So I blew it up again and was going to tape the valve shut while I waved it around but this time it actually married.  It didn't stay inflated for more than a day but my kids may have been playing with it.  I walked with it up and down the street like a crazy person but the crows and what ever is waking me up in the morning definitely took notice.  I haven't hung it outside yet but if I can keep it inflated I'll hang it up.  So far birds are further away so no 4am alarm.
3.0,It is a nice size - fairly large. But the place where you blow it up would not stay closed. I had to use package sealing tape to keep it closed and keep it from leaking air.
5.0,"I have two pair of Pileated Woodpeckers attacking my window frames.  These ""Scarecrow"" owls have really worked for me.  You have to move them around and they are best if they look like they are perched.  I had tried a hard body owl from Home Depot that had a rotating head on a spring.  It was decapitated by the Woodpeckers in short order, several times.  These inflatable ones are much less expensive and work better and are holding up well.  I have just purchased more of them."
4.0,very nice
1.0,It won't hold air and I can't find the leak. Junk.
5.0,"Doves were spending the night in a tree above my wife's car and making a mess.  After the owl was suspended below the roosting place, no more doves."
5.0,"Nice product, looks great, but it has no effect on the starling nesting in my garage"
1.0,Valve stem will not stay closed. Closed the stem with it deflated and it came 60% out and any amount of pressure would pop it out. A piece of junk.
5.0,Had the C22HD for use in a small lawn service that i operated with my boys.  Literally placed tons of fertilizer with this machine. Sold the lawn service and the buyer took my C22HD.  Bad Mistake.  Great Spreader.  I'm buying another one today for personal use on my 3 acre property.
5.0,"The assembly was a PIA because I'm not a machinists who has an intuitive feel for bolt sizes and types. The assembly requires concentration, have your beer after the assembly, unless your a mechanic or machinists. If so, it's probably very easy to assemble. Once assembled it's a very well built, well thought out machine. Remember though, clean them out after every use, fertilizers are salts after all. Easy to push and maneuver, intuitive controls. Worth the money...."
5.0,"I bought the C22HD as a gift for my father, who has struggled through years of cheap, plastic spreaders. His most recent model is about 5-6 years old, and finally died this last season. I thought it only fair that I get him one, since he typically lays seed and fertilizer on my lawn as well.

This is a very impressive spreader. It comes in a medium size box (smaller than I thought it would be), and takes a couple of hours to put together. I went slowly, and made a couple mistakes since I was watching tv, so it may go faster for others. Only a handful of basic hand tools are needed.

You can tell this is a company that takes pride in its work, they didn't cheap out on the build quality. The tires are fantastic, big enough to roll over most any terrain you'd care to take care of. The powdercoated finish on mine was quite nice, and the handles are comfy to use. My father when he received it was very excited, its clearly nicer than any of the cheapo ones he's been using his whole life. This should last through my lifetime at least."
5.0,"The broadcast spreader works great.  No problems with the spreader itself.  I did read a lot of other reviews before buying this spreader and saw where a lot of people talk about the assembly instructions.  Wellllll, i agree totaly with how much some one at Earthway needs to improve these instructions.  You will need to double up on your patience pills before attempting to assemble this product.  It took me close to an hour to put it together.  NO joke for sure.  Besides that, i really like this spreader."
4.0,"I was like most homeowners who didn't want to spend an ARM and a LEG for a good not expense SPREADER... but i found out the hard way as well, you have to spend a little more to get a great more.  My Earthway Broadcast Spreader is a thing of Beauty.  I'm on a bit more then an half acre and even with my Earthway full all the way, I have NO problem putting down seed, or fertilizer is a easy job now. the large tires and large hopper, even the padded handle bar make spreading a SNAP.  Assemble was not that bad, it took me a little over an hour to get up and running, (it's true what they say the instructions could be a little bit miss leading if you don't pay close attention.  Other then that I love evetything about my Earthway.  This spreader is by far the best spreader one can own HANDS DOWN>>>>"
5.0,"The broadcast spreader took about 2 hours to assemble.  Not difficult, just time consuming.  I have used it a couple of times and am happy with the purchase.  The spreader coverage area is large (about 5 feet) allowing coverage in a very quick amount of time.  Contacted the company with some questions and they were very responsive.  Delivered quickly as promised.  Would buy again."
5.0,"Yes, this was definitely overkill for my half acre...  but that's what I'm all about :)
I went through a couple green spreaders over the last 10 years.  All crap.
I saw this and knew it would last forever and then some.  Very heavy duty.
The other reviews pretty much sum it up.
It's expensive, but most things that are worth buying are not cheap.  I figure that 1 year of commercial lawn service to apply fertilizer/weed killer is about seven or eight hundred bucks.  If I'm going to do it myself, then I want a top of the line spreader.

I do use mine for salt.  I don't use rock salt, I use calcium chloride or magnesium oxide pellets.  I leave the agitator in and I go slow so it doesn't throw the salt too far (onto the lawn).  I never leave salt in the spreader for more than a day so it doesn't absorb moisture and harden in the hopper.  I also use a plastic grocery sack as a hopper cover to keep snow/water out and finally I rinse it with a bucket of hot water after each storm/use.  I know that Earthway discourages use with salt, but I've had no problems with it.

The only thing that I might recommend is a way to fold the handle down so it stores a little easier.  I don't think this product is aimed at the residential market though, so it's probably not on their drawing board.

****Update: December 2014 - This spreader has held up well.  It still works very well.  I store it outside but protected from rain.  No corrosion.  No other problems.  I did buy the Earthway elastic rain cover for the top for about fifteen bucks so that rain doesn't get into the fertilizer/salt/seed.  I use it mostly for grass seed and weed/feed.  Still happy with it and fell that it is worth the extra expense over other brands, even if you only use it a few times per season on an averaged size property."
1.0,"The handle assembly didn't fit.  The manufacturer sent replacements, and after shimming and bending, I was able to make everything work correctly.  The manufacturer shipped a complete new unit that was only slightly better than the first.  After all the work, I'm keeping the first one.  About $125.00 over priced."
5.0,"Earthway C22HD could be the last broadcast spreader you'll buy.  I guess the ""HD"" stands for ""Heavy Duty"" because it is HEAVY DUTY.  But not too heavy to push.  Everything that should be metal is, and the gear case, wheels and hopper are durable plastics, which is good, because fertilizer is pretty corrosive.  The spreader is expensive but, as far as I'm concerned, worth it if your budget can handle it.  After two of the much cheaper green ones from the big box store that didn't last nearly as long as I thought they should, I was ready to take the step.  I do note that the spreader really does not appear to be suitable for spreading rock salt because that stuff is so dense, it'll damage the agitator in the bottom of the hopper even though it's metal.  With the agitator removed, I don't think rock salt would drop through the holes in the bottom of the hopper very well.  I haven't actually tried it with rock salt and don't plan to.

Several previous reviewers commented about poor instructions, assembly time and difficulty.  My take is that the instructions are not that bad, but do read them carefully all the way through, identify all fasteners by size and lay out all parts before you start assembly.  If you're one of those folks who don't read instructions as a matter of principle, you just might have met your match.  I'm not a rocket scientist, engineer or mechanic, but I did fly jets.  My time to assemble was  apparently about average, two and a quarter hours and two beers, going at a very deliberate pace to avoid mistakes.  When they tell you not to tighten nuts until a later step of assembly, there's a reason.  And when you're done, you should never have to do this again, ever!

Since buying this Earthway spreader, I have used it once for putting down my spring fertilizer.  Worked perfectly.  Definitely overkill for my half acre, it could do a much larger yard.  I especially liked the large pneumatic tires because my back yard is hilly and a little rough.  They go over the bumps and taller grass with ease.  The hopper is larger than it looks in the illustrations and will definitely hold a 50 lb. bag of fertilizer.  The larger hopper that's available would make it really heavy.  The spreader instructions have a table that lets you easily figure the correct drop setting using the number of square feet the bag of fertilizer will cover, but I think it will take some experimentation to get the best results for my grass.  A fertilizer spreader may not be that exciting, but so far this is about as good as it gets.  American made is a bonus."
5.0,"Like everyone else, your Scott's spreader from the ""big box"" store last 1 or 2 years and you throw it in the trash.  The stupid 4"" plastic wheels only roll over lawns as flat as your driveway, and the gearbox mechanism that broadcast the material rusts in no time at all.

I was tired of that game so I hired a professional lawn service for the past few years.  Oh yeah, it was wonderful, but who can afford to keep them employed anymore?

This year I went hunting for a broadcast spreader just like the professional lawn services use.  I was disappointed when I couldn't find one in the major city I live in, so I got online and read the glowing reviews for this unit.  Next I then went to the manufacturers website and looked at all the models and decided on this one - partly because their website has COMPLETE vidoes from opening the box to having a fully assembled unit with a few basic hand tools.

Assembly went very smooth as I built the unit inside the house so I could reference the computer video and written instructions.  Zero issues - and the unit actually came with all the nuts, bolts, washers, and other parts (bonus points Earthway).

Now when I spread material on my 1 acre lot, with lots of bumps, ridges, and holes, this unit glides over them with zero issues.  The unit is very well built with a ball bearing shaft for the 6"" (??) wheels (more like tires!!) and fully enclosed gearbox.

I have found everything positive that was said on the other reviews for this unit to be exactly true.  I have nothing bad to say about this unit and have spread about 35-40 bags of material of all sorts so far.

Thank you Earthway!

P.S. - I bought it on Amazon with my Prime Shipping and received the unit in no time at all!

UPDATE - 3-28-12

Still going strong!  Pulled it out this past weekend and it worked perfectly as I spread Scott's Bonus S on the yard.  One of the best purchases I've ever made in my life!"
4.0,Inflates easily. Stays inflated but after awhile needs to be blown up again--typical for most inflatable things.
5.0,It works great.  We haven't had hawks to get into the hen house with it handing on the fence.
2.0,The one on the roof level / wiring worked great. However. the one in the shrubs didn't have any effect.
3.0,not as I was expecting.
3.0,"Does not keep inflated , loses air quickly."
1.0,"Ordered twice and returned both.  The way the inflatable is packaged, the fill valve becomes mis-shappened and will not stay closed.  Never able to get inflatable to hold air."
4.0,"First I will say blown up or not he deters pigeons. The closure did not work so it didn't stay inflated, but still kept the birds off my balcony. Then I thought about cutting him open at the top, stuffing him with newspaper and closing him up with a bandaid. I re-hung him and  he looks great blowing around. Will buy again."
3.0,"When you blow it up, all of the air rushes out before you get it closed! The air shut off thingie is very cheap and it took several tries to keep it closed.

Seller was great"
4.0,"Pretty effective, hard to keep inflated.  DIdn't matter, birds stayed out, as well as squirrels.  Actually got fruit this year."
1.0,I've had a terrible time with sparrows this year.  They were eating LOTS of seed meant for guineas & chickens and then they pooped all over the place.  The sparrows even built nests in our machines which plugged up the air intake.  I bought two owls and hung one in the barn and one in the shop where they could move freely.  We didn't see any change in the number of nasty birds.  I was very disappointed in this purchase.
5.0,I hung several of the owls in my apple trees  by strings so that they would move which made them more life-like.did a great job of keeping crows out.
1.0,The valve on the owl does not work. It does not seal - pops open. I paid $8.something and not worth the effort to return it and get money back. If you return or try to get it replaced it cost additional $5.50+ your time.
1.0,I ordered this product and the closure did not work. I sent it back and the replacement did not work either. I would not recommend anyone purchase this product.
1.0,I thought this inflatable would work for my garden but it would not stay inflated and looks more like a toy. Gave it away.
1.0,"I've had one of these before and really liked it. It kept the birds away from the garden ! This one did not hold air. The plug would pop out as soon as it was inflated. Even after I used a clamp to keep the plug in, it would lose all air in 5 minutes, so the seams must not have been sealed properly either. Works great ... if it holds air !"
3.0,"Grackles are a nuisance bird in Central Texas.  I like my scary owl, though he probably makes me feel better about the situation than actually freaking out the grackles.  He does seem to be a slight deterrent.  He has also successfully weathered a few thunderstorms, so he gets to stay in the backyard.  It's a good buy for the price."
4.0,"Have had ongoing problems with birds (mourning doves, robins, then sparrows) liking to build their nests on top of our downspouts which conveniently are located by our patio and front doors. There are plenty of trees around, they should nest there. So I tie one of these owls to the spout and it is fun to watch the first day when the birds come swooping in with a twig and stop mid-flight and hastily depart. These work well, so long as you keep them inflated. I have one from my purchase that has a leak, going to take that up with Amazon, but otherwise they work well."
2.0,"Birds seemed to be attracted to the owl, couldn't keep them out of my flowering shrub and the valve was very difficult to keep air in once inflated.  Birds were not intimated by the owl at all"
1.0,"waste of money ...did not do its job..will not buy from you again
will not recommend to my friends.period
should remove product from site"
1.0,Never found out how it would be at scaring animals.  Inflation process very difficult.  Hard to get enough air into the owl to make it stand up and look realistic.
5.0,"No problem, but I recommend turning off at night. If the water gets to low it struggles..."
5.0,Wonderful product. Super service.
5.0,Great little pump.  Lasts a long time if you keep the filter clear of debris.
3.0,the water flow is not as strong as I expected it to be. It's used in a small water fall only about 2 1/2 ft. high.
5.0,"In continuous use outdoors for over a year!
Very reliable..."
5.0,I have this pump sitting in a filter box and connected to my waterfall.  The last one I had lasted several years and ran continuously.  I have this one connected to a timer so I only run it during the daylight hours.  I suspect it will last for several more years.  Time will tell. It is a real sturdy pump and works well at the recommended height.
5.0,"I purchased this pump to replace the original one that came with a fountain.  The first pump lasted for many years. Space was limited.  After checking all my local garden and irrigation stores, I found this pump on Amazon."
2.0,The product picture was not the same as the product delivered. Note this has metal screws showing. That holds the cover on and protects the blades. My old one was like that so I thought I was ordering the same thing based upon the photo. My new one had no metal screws. It screwed on by itself. It came loose and broke the first time I used it. Now I have to pay to mail it back and 20% to restock. That stinks.
4.0,"I have used this type of gloves for many years but had lost the last pair , so I am very glad to get these.  Why do the stores not carry Isotoner gloves anymore?"
1.0,"Today this pump stopped working for me. I am not happy. I just bought it in Aug. 2012 - I use it for my goldfish and he needs this fountain // water flow, especially now. Of course it's the new year eve and yadda yadda so I'm SOL.........  If it were not needed for my 17 year  old gold fish I would not care. FISH NEED AIR. Of course it's late in the day too. : ((( I am so upset."
5.0,Easy to install and comes with a really long power cord that makes it easy to hide and esthetically attractive. Runs non-stop for years with no maintenance and provides a good flow.
4.0,"no problems with this pump buy it a while back and put on on after 6 months it still working great,"
1.0,"Bought this last pump from Amazon in June, 2013 for use in an outdoor pond.  That makes two Beckett pumps that have broken so far.  Maybe they are ""maintenance-free"" because they just stop working and have to be returned to Beckett.  Don't buy it!  Send it back to China."
5.0,"I use this on my small 100-Gallon pond.  Went with a smaller size, other one just a little Larger kept spitting the water out of the pond.  So far so good.  If it hold up 3-years I will be very happy !"
4.0,I wish I have fish now.  I used to have fish in my pond outside my house.  I don't have it anymore.  This thing works like a charm for them.  I just have a waterfall now.  It's great.
4.0,"this pump works well.  I would like it better if it was putting out a bit more water, but it makes the fish  happy!!"
4.0,"It was a bit smaller than we thought, easy to install and working good.  Have no complaints and would order again."
5.0,"It is a great pump for the size of our pond, which is approximately 5' x 31/2' and 3' deep with a ledge to set a potted water Iris on. Does a great job pumping over the water fall."
5.0,great pump works as described fairly powerful would recommend to anyone my pond gets dirty quick and it is still pumping and not clogging yet
4.0,WE ORDERED THIS UNIT FOR PUMPING WATER INTO A WATERFALL IN OUR GREENHOUSE.  WORKS GREAT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT.
5.0,This pump is strong. I run both my fountain and waterfall off of it. I recently bought the Beckett filter to go with it and the pond water looks great!
5.0,"The pump was a great price, and it is already on its second season.  It survived the New Hampshire winter, and pumps the water consistently for my waterfall all day and night.."
3.0,"Have an outdoor fountain this pump was installed in.  10 months later it just stopped working.  I have had pumps that went 3 or 4 years. One even went 7 years.  This one did not even make it one year.

UPDATE:  I removed the cover on the outside of the motor (3 screws) and found some mulch type stuff inside. I removed it and the motor is running again and pumping the water fountain again.  I should have done that before complaining.  Oops, sorry."
5.0,I really like the fact that the pump turns off when the water level gets low. I keep it running during freezing weather and it didn't have any problems (of course in central Texas we don't have much freezing weather).
5.0,"Working Great, feeds water from a small 110 gal fish pond upto a small waterfalls.  Would recommend to anyone with a small requirement.  Thsi is the second one I've owned, first one lasted five years before it frooze and the ice broke it open this year."
4.0,"This little pump is dynamite in a small package.  I have had it on almost continuously since i bought it in December.  It runs smooth.  Low maintenance, just cleaning out the filter every couple of days.  Exactly what I needed for my 4ft diameter backyard pond."
5.0,This is a great pump for small ponds and waterfalls.  It is easy to install and maintain.  I have had one of these before and it lasted 3 years and with continual 24 hour use.
5.0,I have a turtle pond and have to change the pumps every 1 to 3 years. This one is still running and so far I am happy with it.
5.0,"This is a real durable pump,,it is used in my front yard fountain,,and it does a very good job,, and it has lasted a long time...."
5.0,This is an exact copy of the pump that finally gave up afet many years of constant outside use. I like it just fine
5.0,The pump has worked perfectly since we bought it.  We use it in a small pond to pump water up through a small fountain.
5.0,This Beckett pump is excellent. I had the same pump that failed after 6 years of 24/7 operation. I have 2 ponds and the pump in the smaller pond is still working. The bigger pond has more fish and more water so it has to work harder. I've been told by other pond owners that the performance on this pump is amazing. Most people have to replace pumps much sooner than 6 years. Thank you for carrying Beckett pumps.
5.0,"The pump was just what I ordered.  Arrived in perfect shape, even a little sooner than I expected.  No problems at all!! I was very satisfied."
1.0,"I have a 125 gallon pond with 2 of the G325A's for water clarity.  I'm in the Chicago area and generally run the pump 24/7 between mid May and late September.  Religiously, the pumps fail every 2-3 years.  My 8th G325 just failed.  I decided to call Beckett and they reminded me that the instruction sheet says this direct drive pump has an operational temperature between 32F and 86F.  It's a very warm summer in Chicago, the pond is in the shade for the afternoon due to house shading and 50% exposed in the morning due to the trees.  The existing water temperature is 91 degrees.  There is no way a pond of this size is not going to be less than 86F during the summer.  Beckett customer service did not have any further suggestions.  Being that I'm an engineer, this pump is not designed for reliability under normal operational conditions (e.g. summer) and I'm hoping I can find something that fits the pond better.  I have tried to run for 8 hrs/day (4 hrs AM, 4 hrs night), they still religiously fail."
1.0,The pump worked okay for a couple of months last year.  I took it out of the fountain in the fall and stored it in the garage over the winter.  I put it back in the fountain this spring and it didn't operate at all.
5.0,"The product was delivered on time, in perfect shape, content of the package matched that being advertised, at fair price searched for that product. Very reliable pump. This is the second Beckett pump I have purchased in about 5 years. The first failed after continuously running for about 5 years. I do intend this pump to run 7dx24hrsx365d. I use the pump for a mid-size outside pond and I'm hoping it will exceed the continuous running time of the first one."
5.0,"Husband John here - we have two of these pumps, owned both for 10 years or so. One is in a small outside 3 tiered fountain and the other is in use in an 80 gallon aquarium as part of a filtering system I've built. Both units have been very dependable. If you can get the 210 for less than 60.00 it's a good deal IMO. *** NOTE: The pump has a small filtering cap over the input port that will allow debris to go through. That will effect performance and cause it to eventually clog up and trip your circuit breaker. If your water is less than very clean I would recommend buying or making an additional filter cap to go over it. I bought one for it locally at a Home Depot but went DIY after a year...our outside water will get leaves and dirt that accumulate so I placed a piece of screen inside it, cut to fit and placed a piece around the exterior of the cap and wrapped it with a plastic tie wrap. It holds on snug but will slip off easily enough to clean. The pump is inside a block in the fountain bowl so it's not visible. Works fine. I made a foam cap for the aquarium system that I can clean once a week and it does fine. *** If you find yours does ""shut off"" - unplug it and try taking the filter cap off, unscrewing to the left and remove it. Then take out the screws you see with a Phillips head screwdriver till they're loose and remove the cover. Rinse the inside out with a hose and clear any debris you can see, shake it out good and reassemble. Reset your circuit if it needs it and plug it back in and test. I had to do this a couple times initially until I got the filtering right. Other than that, they've been trouble free."
5.0,"This product was as advertised, shipped promptly and works great. Good size if you have a waterfall and a water fountain. Will do both with no problem."
1.0,"I bought this pump for a small pond only comes on 5 hours a day summer time only ,I remove pump and store away for winter . The first one lasted two summers , This one only lasted last summer and a couple days this spring . It died like the last one ,  I will buy from a different company and would tell all of you reading this to do the same."
1.0,"I have had my KOI pond for about 6 years and this is the worst pump I have ever purchased!  It does not even outperform the 10 dollar waterfall pump which is over three years old.

In short, do not waste your money or you will end up stuck after 6 weeks having a pump that craps out. I can not even return it because I would lose money shipping it back just to receive a partial refund."
5.0,"Purchased this pump for a small water garden feature.  Quickly installs and has a great outflow.  There is also
a flow adjustment.  Excellent submersible pump for a 200 gallon water garden."
5.0,Got this pump to replace a Beckett pump I've had for 8 years and it finally gave up.  This is a slightly larger pump and works great.  I use it from late March through early November in the fish pond (300 gallon) and this one has great water flow and keeps the pond well aerated.  Very happy with this pump.
2.0,"Loooked like good unit by the reviews however ours failed after only 9 months, now researching how the two year mfg warranty works."
5.0,Very reliable pump.  This is the third Beckett pump I have purchased in just over 10 years.  I run my pump 24 by 7 365 days a year and last 5 years each.  I use the pump for a outside pond in NJ and it just keeps pumping.
4.0,"The pump arrived in perfect condition, its a little frustrating fighting it out of the packaging. Nothing a sharp knife wouldnt solve. I set the tubing up to the pump, dropped the pump in the water, plugged it in and out came the water on the other end. No hicups, no struggling. Very quiet motor considering its size. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the inability to adjust water flow. The speed you get is the speed you get. For most applications this is no big deal, however Im using it on a custom made reptile waterfall in my house and now I have to try and manualy disperse the waterflow accross the surface to control the path of the water (its power is causing the water to hit the rocks and shoot across the enclosure like a hose). As for the pump though, it really is a great buy!"
5.0,"It has been working 12 hours a day now for around 90 days. Just the right size for my pond, Fast shipping and a fair price."
4.0,"I bought the Becket underwater pump to replace a pump for my tile saw.  I have only ran it for a short while, however it seems to work wonderfully.  The MK pump that came with the saw was rated at 170 gallons per minute.  The Becket pump that I purchased seems to be made in a similar fashion a small but heavy duty pump.  Based on the design, function and price.  I would certainly buy this pump again.  I hope this helps."
5.0,Bought this pump to replace a similar pump in my garden fountain that died. Installation was a bit of a bear because the wires leading to the supply were buried so while trying to pull the wire from the old pump thru the earth it broke. That meant digging it up and replacing it with the new wire. After getting that done it was simply a matter of hooking it up to the on/off switch and turning it on. It works perfectly and we love the sound of the falling water.
4.0,"After chasing around town looking for a replacement pump I remembered that Amazon always had just what I wanted and it was usually available Now!!
Thanks again, my fountain is pumping water and we enjoy hearing the water splashing - even the humming birds come and do their bathing in the flow of water,"
2.0,Mine lasted 1.5 years.  Ranit 24/7 in a small pond with minimal maintenance other than occasional cleaning. For the price I expected to get a longer life out of the pump.  I think I will get more value from a less expensive product.
4.0,"I have this for my goldfish kettle pond. It is strong and very quiet. It works well but you need to get the filter attachment (which i mentioned in another review does not snap on very well). So if you need a lot of filtering i would buy the filter box. i also bought the fountain attachments which worked well, but there are no directions with it. Eventually i figured it out. Its a good pump, my fish are alive and healthy."
5.0,The Beckett 70602 325 gph Submersible Pump works great in my pond.  It never gave me a problem running 24-7.  Good product.
4.0,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SAME MODEL BECKETT PUMP FOR YEARS AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD GOOD SERVICE UP TO AND SURPASSING ITS WARRANTY PERIOD... ONLY ONCE,, OUT OF MANY DID THE PUMP MALFUNCTION WITHIN THE WARRANTY... I SENT THE PUMP TO BECKETT AND CO. WITH THE DATE OF PURCHASE/RECEIPT AND THEY IMMEDIATELY REPLACED IT WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED.... I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS SAME PUMP IN THE FUTURE....THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST - - JLG"
5.0,"Hi, great pump.  #G325AG20 is now #7060210 Pump-G325AG.  The manufacturer's list price is $49.97 plus shipping costs when they have it in stock.  The list price is not $99+.  As of today Beckett is Out of Stock on this pump plus a bunch of other models.  I am hoping Beckett is not going out of production on their pond and fountain pumps as that would be heart breaking as Beckett has probably the best small pond and water fountain pumps.  They are very quiet and last longer than other brands.  If the pump is used regular it will last 2-5 years and sometimes longer depending on how well you take care of it.  If you live in a freezing area the pump needs to be taken out of the water, drained and kept dry and from freezing during the winter.  I keep my Impeller blades clean and lubricate with WD-40 occasionally when I drain my water fountain."
3.0,"Without any tubing on this pump it maybe shoots up 14-16 inches, so any project that is a foot high or less would be ideal for this pump"
4.0,"Bought this Beckett pump as the last one I had was made in the USA. This one arrives and is made in China. Nothing against the people who made it, but hated to see yet more jobs leave the United States. So far the pump is as good as the last one I had, which would probably still be working had I not dropped it and cracked the housing. Alas."
3.0,"I bought this same model three years ago and now it's failed (keeps tripping the GFI receptacle, which I proved to be good) so I ordered the same model number.  But now they make the cord 16' long when it used be 20' long.  The description above still says 20' (on 6/15/11) but the actual package says 16'.  I need the full 20' so I returned it (no hassle).  I'll have to find a pump with a longer cord."
5.0,"excellent for my application; replacement for one I purchased several years ago; right dimensions for my fountain application - fits into small space that I had available, unlike later models. price was right."
5.0,These pumps don't last forever. This is a replacement of one just like.  Actually left town and think the previous one broke because pond didn't get filled. Product and delivery was perfect.
5.0,Once again Beckett makes a wonderful small pump for areas where you don't want gushing water.  This pump is excellent for keeping the water moving without making a lot of water noise and absolutely no motor hum.  Wonderful pump.
5.0,"This is a great pump! The price on this pump was so much cheaper than any store, after I bought this pump I checked the price at Lowes and Homedepot for the same pump and they both wanted double what I paid here. You will be happy with the purchase."
5.0,"We replaced an older Beckett pump with this one in our outdoor fountain. The previous one was small and the outside grate frequently clogged with yard debris. This one is totally different. The design is MUCH better and instead of having to clean it once a day, we only clean it maybe once a week and it still works great. It's also quiet and moves a lot of water.

We did have some issues with seeds (from the birds around our fountain) getting inside and making the pump rotor stop spinning, but Beckett has provided excellent customer service through their Facebook page. Not only did they replace the pump, they cleaned out the one we bought and returned it to us along with instructions for how to do it ourselves if we ever have the same trouble with it again."
5.0,"Had this same pump for 10 years, finally gave out after running almost daily.  Awesome little pump for a 25 gallon fountain.  Small size is a huge plus.  New pump is working great, will always buy Beckett if available."
5.0,"Buy this pump from Amazon, Lowes wants $80, this pump is awesome-out performs the Little Giant I used to have which I payed $80 for at D&B. All and all a great product that delivers what it promises."
5.0,I ordered this pump for my small fish pond and am really pleased with how well it works.  It was easy to assemble and pumps really well.
5.0,This pump is the perfect size for our 175 gallon pond. It pumps very well to our small waterfall. It also fit nicely in our filter box.
1.0,The visual and description of the outlet lead me to believe it was a different size. I was unable to get any couplings to attach the pump to the filter I use. Only good for attaching to small tubes. Return was easy.
5.0,"I have used several pumps for my small koi pond, and have found this to be the most reliable for periods of up to about 18 months. My current Beckett pump is my third, and although this does not appear to be great, it has certainly been the most reliable in performance and economic in cost, over two other types used in the past, regarding less needs for cleaning and servicing. It seems that smaller pond pumps are not too reliable over long periods but this one, for me, has been the best value for money."
5.0,"I am on my third one in 24 years.  Death has ALWAYS been caused by lack of maintenance (leaf-choking or running out of water), never product quality.  It's a great little pump."
5.0,"I bought this pump as a replacement for the exact same one that finally died after years of service. I had recycled the pump from a small water fountain from the previous house owners into a half-barrel pond, and it ran for about 5 years, 24/7, on top of however long it had been in service previously.
The water-intake cover you see in the picture unscrews, and you can replace it with a real pre-filter tube, sold separately (I found it at Home Depot, it's this one on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beckett-Corp-Add-On-Repl-Prefilter-7137710-Filter-Sterilizer-Pond/dp/B000MQTPDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beckett Corp Add On Repl Prefilter 7137710 Filter/Sterilizer Pond</a>), and you can just keep washing or replacing the filters.
It's the perfect capacity for my bamboo spout, keeps the water clear for the gold fish in there."
1.0,"This pump barely put out any water pressure used in my small pond.  I have had other similar pumps where the flow pressure was much better.  However, these other pumps (purchased from Lowe's Home Improvement) did not last long and were not well-supported via warranty.  The Beckett 210GPH should have been sized fine for my needs, but it operates at much less than the 210 rated GPH.  This ended up being a poor purchase decision for me."
4.0,This pump is working excellent and so far seems like a great investment for my needs. One thing that I would like to mention is that it does not come with any connectors to hook up to your system. I read that it had a 1/2 inch thread in other reviews. It infact does have a 1/2 threaded connection how ever if you purchase a 1/2 inch connector be advised it may not fit and actually be to large. Make sure that the inner diameter of the connector you buy is an actual 1/2 inch. Other than that it performs excellently and quietly and keeps my indoor aeroponic system flowing well.
5.0,"Excellent little pump that does the trick.  This pump replaced a older larger pump and does the job, just as well."
5.0,Couldn't find locally and it is the ONLY pump that will fit into the housing for my courtyard fountain.  Great find using Amamzon.  Prompt delivery.
5.0,"Very fast delivery, and huge savings over buying this same pump at a big box store or a water garden center.  Highly reccommend this seller!  My old pump (5 years) finally melted down and quit, leaving my pond fish quite unhappy in the still, unfiltered water.  Quiet complaints quickly turned into threatening demands and talk of unionization.  Acting quickly, I went to a store and was sent reeling by the prospect of paying $60.00 to $80.00 to keep about $12.00 worth of goldfish happy.

""Try Amazon"", someone said.  Sure enough, staring back at me from a somewhat dusty and fingerprinted computer screen was the very pump i sought... and at a fraction of the retail price!  ""Eureka!"", I exclaimed, as I pulled my credit card out of its slot in my wallet and sent it flinging past the screen and to the floor behind the desk...  Sorry, i digress.

Two (business) days later, the pump arrived.  This was several days sooner than promoised!!  I cleaned the filter, installed the new pump and all was once again right in the little fish pond that I often wonder why I ever bothered with in the first place.  But I'm not wondering now.  The pond is crystal clear, and the goldfish are so happy that they...  Well, this is a family web site after all...  Let's just say that in the past few days I have seen and heard the pitter-patter of little fins swimming around in the pond!  Another generation of little goldfish have arrived!  Now if i could just get the big ones to stop eating the newborns, I'd have my own little Utopia in my back yard."
4.0,It has only been running for one season and therefore has not passed the test of time. That being said it worked real well for the past four months and has now been put away for the winter.
5.0,"We got this within one day of ordering it!. This is something we use 24 hours a day every day, year round. Yes, sometimes they break down after four years of continuous use in a dirty pond in the hottest summers (100 degrees plus) and freezing winters (45 degrees below). It's the best on the market. If there is another pump that works forever, then I'd give this a lower rating, but this is the benchmark and the best you can get and it cost less than $40."
1.0,"Item had been repackaged, badly, and it was broken.  Big disappointment, not up to Amazon standards, although they did not ship it.  It is always a big gamble when Amazon does not sell it from stock, rather from a third party.  And they will not replace, must wait for a refund.  Will not buy from these turkeys again."
5.0,"After trying several other pumps, all of which ceased working after a few months, I was thrilled to get this pump.  Although I haven't been using the pump very long, I can tell a major difference in the way it is working vs. the other pumps that died quickly.  This pump is doing a great job circulating water in my small pond.  My fish love swimming around it too."
5.0,"This is the one pump that has never let me down. I have had one replacement under the warranty in 8 years . Company very good at sending out fresh pumps quickly.  I learned that whatever pump you buy always have a backup just in case. Love the ease of use.  The long cord is handy, and the fact it easily fits in a sunk pond filter box is a plus. I have plenty of room for my bio materials and filtering medias. Two thumbs up..."
5.0,"I was concerned this pump was over-sized for my 75 gallon megaflow / overflow style aquarium. It works wonderfully, perfect size!  The water volume and pressure is PERFECT in our 75 gallon system.

Someone commented on the noise from this pump: As pumps go, the pump has very quiet operation. This aquarium is in our Healing Room, so the soft sounds of the flowing water is very soothing - no distractions at all. We have a different pump on our 125 gallon aquarium that is ALWAYS noisy, distracting when we're trying to watch tv in our living room despite having surround sound.

Kudo's for a perfect pump for our application :-)  I recommend this pump for any under tank overflow filtration system in the 50 - 125 gallon range or small ponds / waterfalls."
5.0,"I had this exact little pump in my small backyard pond for approx. 3 years. It worked great. I used it for circulation as I had a much larger one for my filtering system. I moved away from the coast after hurricane Katrina and I had it stored in a bin outside for 4 years. When i plugged it in it didn't work anymore but I imagine something happened to it over the course of those years in storage. Since I loved that little pump so, I made sure that I replaced it with the exact same pump when it came time to starting up my little waterfall pond at the new place. Other brands are not trustworthy and give up after not very long. If you have aquatic plants sometimes little stringy vegetative matter can make it through the screen and get in the propeller. After I discovered that I routinely (once a week) unplugged the pump and removed the filter (just unscrews by hand) that keeps most of the veg. matter out and put a hose on the output nozzle and let the water flow through in the reverse and blow it out. This was rarely needed tho and just blowing on that end or washing it out was enough. But I only had to do that as I had TONS of plants in my pond. I LOVE THIS LITTLE WORKHORSE."
5.0,This is a quality pump for the price. We have a small pond with a waterfall and it's doing a great job. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,"Pros: Tested it in the sink, nearly hit the ceiling.  Nice long power cord.
Cons: Need accessaries option."
5.0,"I have a small, 3' X 6', backyard water fountain with a few large goldfish. I had this exact same pump in my fountain coming on with a timer for 8 hours every day for 8 years! never had a problem! I saw the same beckett pump on amazon.com and purchased it right away. it sits in a filter box and pumps water up about 2 feet where it falls down a stone falls. the line is split and it also pumps water through a decorative water feature! you can't go wrong with this pump! stay away from the off the wall, over priced brands at the home stores."
4.0,"A very powerful pump for the price. Quiet. Lack flow restrictor, and because of power you will probably need to find an adjustable clamp; this should have been part of design."
1.0,"Since about 1998 I've had a 325 GPH Beckett pump and about every 2-3 years like clockwork the pump fails and trips the GFI receptacle.  I use the pump in a small 1/2 wine barrel pond with an old style well pump.  The head height is less than 24"" and the pump only runs 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening.  I'm pretty careful to keep the screen clean so as not to overheat the pump.  My fourth pump failed yesterday.  It has only been in operation since June of 2008. The good news is, it was a warranty replacement for the previous pump that failed in the exact same way.  Teh bad news is they will not replace a warranty replacement.  The pumps are ""potted"" so they are not servicable and must be replaced when they fail (throw aways).  I would advise against purchasing Beckett pumps as the seem to keep failing the same way and at about the same time frame."
5.0,"We've had one of these models in our waterfall for 4 years. It failed today after running almost continuously during that period. Our fountain is three tiered with a 4"" fall spout. The top of the fountain is about 30"" above the pump. The total volume of water in our fountain is less than 20 gallons. We're very pleased this pump lasted 4 years and will be purchasing this same unit as a replacement. The waterfall is outside and the sound of the pump is imperceptible. The small grill has kept out debris and we've only had to clear it once in four years - but our waterfall is in a rather clean area of the yard with no trees or other items that would clog the pump."
3.0,"I called Amazon customer service and was ""guaranteed"" that the cord was 20 feet ""because it is based upon the manufacturers description.""  I ordered the pump because I need a 20 foot cord and this was the exact model I needed to replace.  The new pumps only have a 16 foot cord.  Take my word - I had it shipped from Amazon and it is really only 16 feet."
5.0,"works great ... installed easily ... does what it says ... strong little sucker !  only wish I have was that it was adjustable ... water height (pressure) ... other than that ... price, craftmanship and ease of installation ... would definitely buy again."
5.0,Product was exactly what was expected.  Turn around on order was fast.  It completed my daughter's weather station and the price was right.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift, so I didn't actually use it myself. But it seems very durable and easy to read, just what you are looking for in a rain gauge. The price was right and shipping was fast."
5.0,"This was a present for my husband and so far, he likes it!
We haven't had enough rain to use it yet."
2.0,"You may want to check with the vendor about what exactly you're getting before ordering this gauge:  I purchased two because of the metric AND english gradations and the price was right - what I got was an inches-only gauge that did not have nearly the precision advertised.  Heck, it wasn't even the same shape or color as pictured!"
1.0,I purchased this rain gauge based upon the photo as I was looking for a rain gauge that had measurements in both inches and mm as shown in the photo --what I received has inch measurements on both sides and not what is show in the picture. I hate it when the photo is misleading and frankly I think its intentional a lot of the time.
4.0,I had a Taylor rain gauge just like this for over 15 years and it took a beating during those years. It is tough and accurate. Easy to mount or just stick it in the ground and remember to move it before you mow the lawn!
5.0,"The rain gauge has been in use outside for the past month and has been relocated several times.  Thus far, it has held up very well and is very easy to read."
5.0,"After years of expensive, artistic garden style rain gages that froze, broke or graduations wore off, we bought this one.  It is accurate, sturdy, easy to read, easy to use and inexpensive.  Plenty of capacity.  My wife loves it!"
5.0,for the price these are a great value. i paid less than this for two very small 4 inch gages and these seem to be about a foot tall. i would do business again with this seller. very fast shipping!
5.0,"If you are looking for a solid, basic rain gauge this is the one to purchase. Can easily read from the house, durable. We of course brought it in when the weather got cold due to freezing. Sometimes simpler is better!"
2.0,"I have owned this for over a month now and we have had multiple heavy rainstorms.  When the storms are over, I check the rain gauge and I have never seen water in it, only bees and other bugs that have managed to die in it.  Would not recommend this to others as it has been worthless to me.  It does seem like durable plastic though."
3.0,"This rain gauge leaked after about a year of service. I am online to buy a new one
[a different brand] that will hopefully last longer. It was very inexpensive, so I suppose you get what you pay for."
1.0,"I bought the Beckett Versa Gold Series model number G535AG20 535 GPH Submersible Pump to replace a similar Versa pump that had been running for at least several years before giving up the ghost (this previous pump was installed by the prior owner of our house).  Installed in Dec 2010, in a small outdoor pond.  The pump is connected to an in-line UV filter to keep the algae away.  Temperatures here in La Jolla never go below freezing, so we run it on a timer that turns the pump on for 8 hours/day, 24/7 year round.  It seized up a couple days ago.  I pulled it out of the pond and could see no visible damage.  I removed the weed guard on the thing and the propeller seemed fine, with no debris or other obstructions.  I could spin it with my finger just fine.  When I plug it in, the motor hums but it doesn't spin.  I wish this thing would last more than a year..."
2.0,The pump does not come with adaptors for the outlet to match up with your existing hoses...you have to go to a hardware store for fittings to hook it up. Most other reputable manufacturers provide them with the pump.
5.0,"This is the most reliable pond pump I've used.  The last one---same model---ran in a rudimentary 300 gallon cement fish pond, without any auxiliary filter, for more than two years 24/7.  For some reason the pump is no longer carried at local retail outlets, so an Amazon option was welcome."
5.0,"I've used this pump in my pond for 16 years. They work great, but need to be replaced every few years. After running 24 hours a day, I guess it's to be expected."
5.0,"great pump........I've had this pump before and it lasted 8 years, so I anticipate this new one will last an additional 8 years."
5.0,"This pump runs reliably for a little under two years. I just bought my third one yesterday and had a note to myself to buy another one next month so that I'd have it when the current one failed. Unfortunately I was one month under in my prediction. I predicted one year 10 months and it failed at one year nine months.

I run mine 24 hours a day every day in a pond that holds around 400-500 gallons.

A filter tip that works for me after years of experimentation and does not require a lot of maintenance: put about an inch of aquarium gravel in the bottom of a medium square pond plant basket. Place the pump inside the basket and then cover it with more gravel so the gravel is to the top of the basket. Every few weeks or as needed vacuum the upper layer of gravel with a large Python aquarium siphon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Python-No-Spill-Clean-and-Fill/dp/B000255NXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Python No Spill Clean and Fill</a>. Vacuuming the gravel will restore the water flow.

Update 6/19/2013: The last pump I put in has run for around four years now. I think the difference is that I have taken out the Water Hyacinth - the roots were ensnaring a lot of muck and also created a lot of fine root hairs. I hardly ever have to siphon the top of the basket now. I suspect the Hyacinth were causing the pump to be overloaded.

Update 10/4/2013: The pump gave out but I think it is because I tried to start it back up when it had a rock wedged in the impeller. I updated it to five stars."
5.0,"This pumps, and it pumps well. Buy a fountian head for it too."
5.0,Works perfectly.
1.0,I've purchased many Beckett pond pumps over the years (2000-2008) due to perceived quality with the Beckett name. None of the pumps lasted for more than a year or two.  Very disappointed with repeated failures considering the high price. Have since switched to much cheaper pumps found on Amazon and they have outlasted the Beckett pumps!
1.0,"I feel really let down.  I've been a loyal Beckett customer for at least 15 years.  But I think I'm done now.  The life of these has been dwindling since I started buying them in the late 1990s.  This one only lasted 5 months, and I was only running it 12 hours a day.  I can live with replacing a pump every 2 years, but every 5 months?  No way."
5.0,"This pump works exactly as described. The one I purchased is now in my portable shop ""swamp cooler"". I got tired of replacing the normal swamp cooler pumps every year and the solution is a submersible pump. I have had this for a long time. It is used daily for the hot summer in Arizona and is still working fine. I highly recommend."
4.0,fine
4.0,Seems like a well designed pump for the money.
5.0,Has been running 24/7 for quite some time now.  I hope it lasts at least 3 years.
4.0,"Have had this pump running in my Aquaponic system now for about a year non-stop.
No complaints!"
5.0,great
5.0,Satisfied Thank you
5.0,This size pump is perfect for my four-bowl fountain. The pump replaces one just like it.
2.0,"Die in about 2 years.  I was too lazy to find another brand. I am glad it was discontinued which forces me to buy something else.  I bought a Danner 02720 Pond Mag 9.5 950-Gallon-Per-Hour Pump which has higher volume, longer warranty and lower price!"
5.0,"I've used these in the past to power the waterfall in our school pond.  They last for several years.  Hopefully, this one will do the same.  The pump arrived right on time and was exactly as advertised."
5.0,I was replacing old pump with the same model so works exactly as expected. I do wish these pumps lasted a little longer as I have never had one last for more than a couple of years. My pond is about 500 gallons with fish and plants and is cleaned quite frequently so I do think that these pumps should last longer than they do.
5.0,good deal on hard to get pump
5.0,W or ks great
3.0,No instructions as to rotate shaft to vertical position when I removed it from package.  I almost sent it back thought it was the wrong pump. It's not obvious as what to do.  If it was my first pump I would have sent it back. Also the side filter screen attachment wasn't threaded so I had to use the older one from my last pump.
5.0,Works as expected
5.0,Love this pump!  Great performance.
5.0,Brand name never lets one down.
5.0,"I have an indoor water fountain that I've had for 12 years. The pump broke, and I needed an near exact replacement to fit into the well of the fountain. This did exactly what I needed and we are back to enjoying our fountain. Product arrived faster than expected as well."
1.0,I would not buy this type pump again.  I have had a lot of pumps over the years and never have had one that continually tripped the breaker.  I had an electrician replace the ground fault plug and that did no good.
4.0,"The timeline for delivery was very satisfactory.  We have used Beckett for over 13 years, however are disapppointed that they only last for approximately one year."
4.0,"I have had three or four of these pumps over the years. They run great for about two years, then develop problems.

The most common problem is eventually the seal on the impeller shaft wears, allowing water into the motor; this causes the GFI (ground fault interrupter) to trip (GFIs are required by code for all outdoor electrical systems). No amount of trying to ""dry out"" the motor will cure this problem. Several companies make pumps with out seals, and are thus immune to this problem. One such manufactures is Danner (Pond Master) pumps.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danner-02728-Pond-Mag-1800GPH-Pump/dp/B000BJP4WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danner 02728 Pond Mag 1800GPH Pump</a>. I use a large (3000 GPH) Danner pump for my water fall which has been in place for about 15 years without a problem.

The second problem that I have had with this pump is hard water deposits collecting on the shaft and seal, slowing down the impeller. Eventually this gets bad enough to stop the impeller. This can be cured by cleaning off the shaft and seal (the impeller can be pried of to get to the shaft) and then using a light oil to lubricate the shaft and seal. If there are any hard water deposits inside the motor, there is nothing that can be done about them. You can tell if there are by how freely the impeller rotates.

The final problem is related to the second problem. When the impeller starts to slow down due to hard water deposits, the motor must use more power, so it runs warmer. There is an internal thermal circuit breaker that will open, turning off the motor until it cools off. This thermal breaker is a necessary evil to keep the motor from overheating (melting, catching on fire?) if it is run out of water. (The instructions clearly state that the pump must be run in water to cool the motor, and possibly lubricate the seal). My last pump exhibited this problem -- it would run for twenty minutes or so, then shut off for ten minutes, then run another twenty minutes.

This cycling on and off can lead to problem number one. As the motor warms, any air inside the motor will expand and the pressure will force the air past the seal on the shaft. Then when the motor cools, the internals cool, causing a vacuum which will suck in anything that is outside the seal, thus water in the motor which will trip the GFI. One previous reviewer stated that he ran his motor on a timer. This is the worst thing you can due to this type of motor for the thermal cycling will lead to this problem as explained above.

Summary: this is a great little motor for about two years, then expect to replace it with another."
5.0,"Works perfect.fits right how I want.
  Fast quick deliver.this is going to be the place to buy parts I need in the future."
5.0,"Excellent pump! Right size, GPM.  It's reliable & long lasting in my backyard stream. I ordered extras so I'll always have spares on hand."
5.0,This is the pefect replacement pump for the office water feature.  The original pumps were nothing but trouble.  These pumps wer easy to install and have the right capacity.
5.0,This pump was a great price and a great product. It was easy to install and is powerful enough to circulate a small waterfall. I would highly reccomend this product; it is better than the pump we had before that cost twice as much.
5.0,I've used these pumps for years in my pond. They usually wear out in about two or three years. I certainly have no complaint with them. They face a lot of hard weather here in Idaho. I highly recommend these pumps.
5.0,I was very impressed with the quick turn time getting this product to me.  Unit was shipped and arrived almost a week ahead of the initial estimate.  Excellent price and availability.  Will use Webb's Water Gardens in the future.
1.0,"I bought one of these in October 2011 and it was DOA - never sprayed a drop.

Fast forward to March 2012 and I still have some spraying to do.  Searched Amazon for a sprayer and this came up again.  I figured, what are the odds of getting two defective units?  Well, the answer is 100% - arrived DOA.

Bottom line - these are not sprayers; sprayers spray stuff, these do not.  At best, these are 1.5 liter yellow jugs.

So, if you are looking for a 1.5 liter yellow jug, these are great (except they are more difficult to use than traditional jugs)"
1.0,DO NOT BUY! BOUGHT IT FOR GLASS CLEANER ONLY! WILL NOT HOLD ANY PRESSURE! NEVER WORKED! WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK! I'M SENDING IT BACK FOR A REFUND!
1.0,"I ordered two of these Gilmore sprayers via Amazon and received promptly.  Both units had air pressure leaks where the handle part of the unit screws onto the liquid holding portion; One sprayer air leaked moderately, the other unit air pressure leaked severely;  I was barely able to use the moderately leaking unit to do a ""rush job"" by very frequent pumping.  The severely leaking unit was not usable because it lost pressure so fast.  I called Gilmore customer service and requested a new unit and was told I would be sent a new replacement sprayer if I would prove recent purchase by sending them a copy of the concerned invoice via email -- I did this and quickly received a new identical replacement sprayer.  I immediately added pure water to the reservoir, operated the hand pump to pressurize, and immediately noted this new replacement sprayer also had a severe air pressure leak making it virtually unusable."
3.0,"I bought two of these sprayers and one worked great, the other would spray but would also drip from the bottom of the nozzle.  I tried everything and I couldn't stop it from dripping.  Thankfully, Amazon is easy and they sent me a new one while the defective one was in transit.  The replacement is just fine and doesn't drip.  The spray is a very fine mist, which is good and bad, depending on what you are using it for."
2.0,I thought this would be a stronger/more durable design. Same design of part I can find locally (Lowe's etc) and it would have been cheaper/faster. It takes a lot of pumping to get fluid flow and it leaks down fairly quickly. The primary leaks seem to be around the threads (as expected). I would not purchase this unit again.
4.0,"I have had excellent luck with all of the Gilmour products I have purchased.  This one comes exactly as shown and carries the tried and true, Gilmour brass mechanics.  The unit is a comfortable size and easy to hold.  Pressure builds quickly (only 10-15 pumps needed) and the adjustable spray pattern and directional nozzle are a plus.  My only complaint lies in the handle; it feels a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the unit.  I haven't had any issues with it to affect performance, but wish the handle had a bit more structure to it.  In the end, this gets the job done, and does it well.  I used it for a natural weed killer, but you can use it for insect treatments, or pre-treating with various cleaners on siding, windows, wheels, tires, and so on."
5.0,"I bought several to use for anything that normally comes in a hand spray bottle.  From cleaning solutions to misting plants with water.  To get an even fine mist, you'll likely need to clean the nozzle before use.  The factory uses a large amount of lubricant - clean most of that out - you'll get a perfect fine mist."
3.0,"Beware, you won't be getting the white/green sprayer as pictured. Instead, you'll receive a yellow-green sprayer with ""GILMORE"" printed on it.  The received sprayer is actually more expensive than this one but I wanted THIS item as I already have one that I use and highly like the spray pattern.  The received item has a little smaller opening to fill with liquid, and a nozzle that swivels which is very good.  The nozzle to adjust the spray pattern is quite small and is screwed to a plastic short extension. It is heavily greased and the grease needs to be removed some to allow a finer spray. The brass nozzle is easily cross-threaded to the plastic extension so be careful.

Originally I had to pump the tank (1/2 full of tap water to test)over 50 times to develop enough pressure to spray. I discovered that you need to tighten the tank quite strongly to prevent leaking of pressure.  After that 7 or 8 pumps were all that was needed with 1/2 tank of fluid.  Its been several hours and the sprayer is still holding its pressure.

It presents a typically fine spray but not so fine as to create a ""mist"" as some sprayers can do.

Overall...it's OK and cheap....but I'll still be looking to replace this at a brick and mortar store."
4.0,"This sprayer is very convenient for spot-spraying weeds, potted plants and small shrubs.  It is far easier to use than a tank sprayer and easy to clean.  The built-in pressure release is an excellent feature because you don't have to hold down the spray valve a long time to expend the pressure when you are finished spraying.  Cleaning is quick and easy also.  The spray pattern (from fine ""cone"" to solid stream) is easy to adjust by simply twisting the brass nozzle. The Amazon picture shows a ""Spray Doc"" which is NOT correct.  The Gilmour sprayer has a yellow-green container with ""Gilmour"" in large black lettering on the side and the top part (sprayer handle/pump handle/nozzle is all black except for the cone-shaped solid brass nozzle.  This is an excellent product, so far.  Durability and reliability remain to be seen over time."
5.0,I really like my barn bird feeder.  Having space for two kinds of seed makes for more birds at the feeder.
3.0,"Looks cute. I have only had the feeder one month and concerned how well it will weather. Also, it is a little cumbersome filling the barn area."
5.0,"Just replaced this same feeder that was purchased in May of 2003.  The silo on the old one finally cracked after several seasons of extreme Kansas summer and winter temperatures.  Just didn't look as good with duct tape, although the birds didn't seem to mind.  Mounted it on a 6 ft. steel 3/4 inch pipe and squirrels never bothered it."
5.0,I like this feeder. It looks so cool! I use a squirrel gaurd type thing to keep the squirrels out!
1.0,I hung two of these feeders about a week ago.  The squirrels have chewed the silos and chewed around the perches on the silos.  They took off the top on the roof and ate from there.  All the bird seed fell on the ground from them jumping up and down on them.  These were a very poor investment!!!!!
5.0,great item fast shiping
5.0,"Works great, attaches easily."
5.0,An excellent saw.
5.0,Bought it for son-in-law and he loves it. Blade is extremely sharp and cuts through the toughest palm leaves/branches with ease.
5.0,Good saw for the price. I cut the handle from a paint roller and fitted it in the saw socket. It gave me the threaded socket I needed to fasten it to my telescopic paint pole. A bolt keeps it from coming out. Works great.
4.0,I wish there was a model with threading inside the handle that I could screw my telescoping aluminum handle into.
1.0,"The proof was not as advertised a simple standard nozzle purchased any where would do the same job with more flexibility, not as advertised. I wish Amazon had done an appropriate review before they passed this one on."
5.0,"This brass jet nozzle was purchased to replace a cheap but effective-til-it-broke nozzle. I found this brass one on Amazon, ordered it, and it works very well. I use it to clean filters from my hot tub and to rinse off concrete. It directs a concentrated powerful stream of water. It might be wise to keep away from children, unless they were supervised by a responsible adult."
5.0,good
5.0,"Was purchased for my 8-year-old granddaughter, who lives on a farm.  She was extremely excited.  Everything looks very durable and colorful."
4.0,"Looks great, a little hard to hang."
5.0,I am really pleased with the big size and detailing of this bird feeder. It is made of sturdy plastic and should take the weather very well. I love it!
3.0,Like the feeder but wire hanger a bit hard to thread
5.0,The birds love this. Easy to fill and cardinals and chickadees love it.
4.0,cute but plasticy
5.0,My aunt love it
4.0,"works well and keeps the water out.  Seed stays fresh and works better than most of the more expensive feeders.

Only bummer is, its hard to fill the middle chamber without spilling a lot of feed"
5.0,Replacing a different feeder. Like the look and appreciate that it sits on a pole vice swinging off a shepherds hook. Also like that there's a finch feeder. No one has posted any notes slamming the feeder so a hit for the birds.
5.0,do a great job
5.0,"Great little nozzle. I love the solid 1 piece design. It should last forever. This paired with a 1/4 turn valve is the perfect wash nozzle setup. Much better than fancier, overpriced spray handles"
4.0,need pressure closure valve...  to make it work best
5.0,Works great condensed powerful stream.
5.0,We didn't need a power washer to clean our pool filter.  This worked fine.
5.0,Great it can reach so far just do what it should
5.0,"good part , fast shipping"
5.0,I owned this before but lost it in a move otherwise I would still have it. It works like a charm for many projects not just watering.
5.0,Almost as good as a power washer 25 times its price.
5.0,Fast shipping.  Delivered exactly as advertised.
4.0,"I love the bird feeder, except for one thing -- not squirrel proof.  The main portion of the feeder has survived the squirrels w/o any issue, but squirrels chewed through the plastic inserts on the silo, opening the holes to where I can no longer place food in the silo because it just pours right out. I think if the holes had metal trim and a metal insert, instead of all plastic, it would have survived them and would still be usable.  Other than that, it holds a lot of food and looks great."
1.0,squirrels got in it same day and completely wrecked it. had to throw it away
5.0,As nice as expected.
5.0,Nice feeder
4.0,love this feeder.  One fill up last several days
4.0,Looks pretty but hard to get the hanging wire straight to hang evenly. The birds empty it fast!!
5.0,It's made well and we have been searching for one like this for quite some time. Very happy with it.
5.0,Love it
5.0,Very nice feeder!  The see-thru sides allow you to see when a refill is needed.
5.0,Super cute and easy for pole installation
5.0,high quality
5.0,This nozzle is perfect for cleaning solar panels!
5.0,This is a very good nozzle.
5.0,"Exactly as expected, shoots a pretty good pressurized stream."
2.0,"Good quality, but did not produce pin point pressure I expected. Definitely falls short of the one I lost, but I don't remember who made that one. Works well, but stream is not as powerful."
3.0,Works not much to say a simple water nozzle.
1.0,Leaky; fits poorly; requires pliers to tighten to point it won't leak.  Prepare to get wet when using.
5.0,I needed a spray attachment that would have the power to knock cobwebs off my two story house.  This nozzle shoots out a powerful jet that does a great job.  It has no moving parts.  Just simple power.
1.0,"When compared with a nozzle from the Lee Valley Garden tools catalog, the Gilmour nozzle is unimpressive.

1) The Lee Valley nozzle costs $4. The Gilmour nozzle costs $8. Yet the Lee Valley nozzle is made in the US while the Gilmour is made in China.  (The total cost of the Lee Valley nozzle could be higher, depending on what else you order and shipping charges).

2) The Gilmour model looks cheap compared to the Lee Valley model. The walls of the Lee Valley model are thicker than the Gilmour model (Lee Valley = 5/32 of an inch thick versus 3/32 for the Gilmour). The Gilmour model has a strange brass color which suggests a cheaper type of brass. The Lee Valley model is a standard fire-hose nozzle brass color.

3) The design of the Gilmour model suggests inferior flow. Note the narrow ""trumpet"" of the Gilmour model versus the Lee Valley.  When water flows down the hose, it looks to me like it will hit the walls of the part of the nozzle the hose screws into before flowing out the trumpet. The transition on the Lee Valley model is far smoother. (I plan on returning the Gilmour so I do not want to run a test)."
5.0,You want pressure?  Get this baby!  Buy extra for presents.  What more can I say?  What more can I say?
1.0,"This product is very attractive to birds and fun to watch. However the water drain holes are too few and too small. Enlarging them would not help as you read on. After it rains, the seeds stick together and because you cannot disassemble the feeder walls, you cannot clean out the coagulated, clumped seed! Very poor design. Do not buy this product unless it never,ever rains where you live!"

I had not had this many birds in such a long time the birds love it, it's adorable, it's the best birdhouse ever so don't let the reviews stop you....try it for yourself!!! Besides it is eye catching and a great show stopper for any yard! I am greatly pleased!"
5.0,WOW I couldn't believe how big this feeder is. Awesome quality as well. Seen a few birds flying around it this morning and checking it out. Haven't landed on it yet.
1.0,The birds tore/broke  the plastic solo off the first day. LOL
1.0,This is really cheap.  The silo perches fell out the first week even though I followed the instructions and made sure they were firmly installed and properly affixed. The lid keeps blowing off in the wind too.  Shame.
5.0,"We love this feeder! Two kinds of seeds can be separated to attract more kinds of birds. It's withstood some pretty good storms so far too. And it's a little bigger than it seems, so it's not a tiny thing. It is big enough and very obvious that it is a barn, not a plastic toy."
5.0,The birds eat out of it often. So far the squirrels have not bothered it.
5.0,"Very cute and sturdy , holds a lot of birdseed"
5.0,This bird feeder is really nice! It's really well made and is so cute! It's exactly as it looks in the photo.  Looks great in the yard. Can hold two different kinds of bird seed. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,Great looking and can hold 2 different types of bird seed
2.0,"Opened box up and the silo was cracked on the top and a piece of it was in the box. Used clear packing tape to fix it. Next....Was attaching the wires through it...Wires detract from the look of it. Next....Was trying to get the wires even, so it doesn't hang lopsided. I attached a couple of metal rings to the wires as there wasn't enough to wrap around my hanging pole. Next...Was filling it. Openings for filling the main area needs to be bigger....Next time I know to bring a funnel. I have it...Finally hanging up. It is cute....But...High maintenance. Now...I ordered a spike...And going to find a 1 inch pole so I won't need the wires. Grrrrr."
5.0,cute
2.0,The deer are still able to rade this feeder from the bird seed. now it hangs in our tree empty 99% of the time.
5.0,Gift for my husband. Birds love it. Not simple to fill but not too difficult.
5.0,Great gift
5.0,A darling bird feeder Just love it so do thr birds
5.0,Bought as a Christmas present for bird lovers and was a great purchase!
5.0,love it ..so do the birds
5.0,birds love it!!!!
5.0,Love it. Thanks
2.0,"Understand before you order this nozzle cannot be spun and shutoff at nozzle.  You have to shut the water off at the hose bib (faucet).  I bought this to wash my cars.  I generally spray car to get it wet and than turn nozzle to shut off water while I soap up vehicle with wash mitt.  This nozzle requires you to go back and shut off faucet at the house, soap the car, and return to faucet to turn on for rinse. Repeat as many times as necessary.  I returned nozzle to Amazon with no problems.  I bought instead ""Hose Nozzle High Pressure for Car of Garden""  solid brass, made in USA, which you can shut off/turn back on at the nozzle.  This nozzle is outstanding and includes 2 nozzles with extra washers."
5.0,I use these spay nozzles at my dog kennels for rinsing and cleaning.  They work like a charm and you can not find them in stores here in my area.
5.0,"high pressure nozzle, and nothing to go wrong. I use it with a cheapo hose-sized ball valve to control the flow. Fancy nozzles eventually seem to leak or break."
5.0,"This isn't fancy but it performs just fine for light cleaning tasks.  It gives a stronger jet spray than my regular hose nozzle and I was able to use it to clean my patio and deck. It knocked down the old wasps nests in the corners of my wood siding without harming the paint. It won't replace a power washer but is a heck of lot easier to use for everyday cleaning chores. I plan on getting more of these for stocking stuffers this year for my brother-in-laws. It is a fairly inexpensive little gadget that is low tech but does what it says it will do, a rarity in today's market place."
5.0,{t is as good as an expensive power cleaner. took the paint right off the front porch just as well as a several hundred dollar high pressure cleaner.  What a bargin.  Nice product.
5.0,This is great for producing a high pressure stream at long distances ........ Great for washing leaves off the roof!
5.0,I just got this nozzle to do some light pressure washing of mold and mildew from concrete blocks in my yard.  It does an amazing job.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.
5.0,"Whenever I need to really _clean_ something, this goes on the end of my pistol-grip sprayer with the threaded end.  It works well for cleaning debris off patios and walkways, too.  Yellow jackets hate it because it tears their nests right off the roof peak.  I love simplicity, and this is it.  Highly recommended.  Oh, they're extremely hard to damage, too. Keep the truck tires off it and it'll last a lifetime or two."
2.0,"Gilmour Solid Brass Water Jet Nozzle #06BJ

Jet [sweeper] nozzles produce a powerful narrow stream that use less water than conventional hose nozzles. We use them to clean the driveway & sidewalks, wash vehicles, and similar tasks. Our hoses have a valve installed at their ends to control water flow.

We own several brands of jet nozzles.  The Gilmour is the worst and the Nelson is the best.

The brass Gilmour Jet works fine when new, but after a few gentle drops onto the driveway, the brass nozzle bent over slightly and partially separated from the base.  It then leaked profusely, making it useless.  The brass on the nozzle part of a Nelson brand sweeper is thicker and larger (stronger) than on the Gilmour nozzle.  The Nelson can easily stand such ""abuse"".  See Customer Images. I've dropped the Nelson nozzle on the driveway a hundred times and it's full of scratches, scratched, but it doesn't bend.

Both jet sweeper nozzles work great, but my advice is to get the better quality Nelson model, especially since the Nelson jet typically costs less.

Search on Google Shopping or Amazon, for ""Nelson brass sweeper Nozzle""."
4.0,"I bought this nozzle initially from Home Depot to clean off the dust from my solar panels on my roof. It worked great, unlike most other ""adjustable"" jet nozzles: the water pressure was sufficient to put down a stream on my roof and remove the dust. I've also used it to power clean the sidewalks. Cleaning the slate front porch and back lanai, however, was not so successful: the slate was too brittle for the pressure!

As another reviewer explained, this is a jet nozzle. Nothing else.

I am buying another one from Amazon: Home Depot doesn't seem to be able to keep them on hand, don't have them on-line, and mine keep disappearing."
5.0,birds love this
5.0,Great birdhouse!
5.0,The birds love it!!!! Several feed at a time!!!! Even after the rains the birds still come....didn't seem to affect the seeds!
5.0,"Just as shown,mother in law loved it!"
1.0,"WARNING - BIRDS HAVE BECOME TRAPPED INSIDE the ""Audubon Red Barn Combo Seed Bird Feeder Model 6290 - Read More Reviews for this Audubon Feeder below
 - Birds love this feeder so much the seed is quick to disappear and when it does what little is left may just be enticing enough for SMALLER BIRDS TO CRAWL INSIDE AND BECOME TRAPPED IN THE FEEDER! If you are purchasing a feeder it is a good bet you love birds and the last thing you want to find is a bird struggling to get out of your feeder - WE HAVE THROWN OURS AWAY - Pictured is a trapped Scaly-Breasted Munia - female - and fortunately she was able to wriggle her way out from under the lip of the see-through glass once we were able to jimmy it a 1/4 inch after thirty five minutes of trying to set her free (breaking it may result in injury or death to the bird if it is still alive when you discover it)
OTHER WARNINGS:
By jjim on October 1, 2014
Several times a bird got trapped under the well where the side panels come down. I was able to pry the feeder apart to release the birds. I thought this probably happened because the feed had run out and the bird got trapped by trying to get at some crumbs inside the feeder. I thought I could correct this problem by making sure there was always seed in the feeder. When I went out last night to refill the feeder there was another bird trapped inside of it. Since there was about 25 percent of feed left apparently the bird panicked and the feed smothered it so that it was already dead by the time I got to it. Please do not buy this item. There is an apparent flaw in its design.
By AllOK on October 17, 2014
Dangerous feeder! Small birds can actually squeeze inside or get their heads caught. We had several birds that died before we could rescue them. And we finally had to crack the side open to get two out.
By Ana C.on August 29, 2016
I was so happy with this bird feeder. But it has a big problem which is the area where the seeds come out is too high/open and we found a bird that got inside the feeder a week or so ago, unfortunately he'd died overnight and today we found another bird trapped but thankfully still alive that we managed to rescue. I think if they closed the gap a little bit it would be so much better, that way no other birds get hurt."
5.0,The birds love it.  Hours of fun watching the different birds that come to eat.

5.0,nice
3.0,"This feeder seemed to be really nice but once i received it, i wasn't too impressed with the way you had to run the wires yourself to create a way to hang it. Once the feeder is full, it is very heavy and unless you really have the wires set up right, it will fall. I never saw any birds eat from the barn part, but the goldfinches really enjoyed the thistle in the silo part. It hung for about 3 weeks before it finally came undone and dropped to the ground, breaking the plastic on the barn. Don't think i would get this again, considering the price and how it was made to hang."
2.0,I do not think it is going to hold up.  it is all plastic
3.0,Don't like hanging ability
4.0,It's very  well made and hold seven cups of seed
1.0,"Disappointed in the poor quality of this one.  It is all plastic and easily breakable if you remove the roof for cleaning.  Oddly enough, of the five feeders we have, birds seem to dislike this one the most.  I would recommend a wooden or metal feeder instead."
5.0,Very cute! Fits a ton of bird food.
5.0,Very unique  feeder. Holds a Hugh amount of feed. Birds like it.
3.0,"Although the feeder is adorable, I have found it extremely frustrating because it doesn't hang well.  Originally, I had it mounted to our deck railing which was nice, but the squirrels could get to it easily and they made such a mess scattering the seed all over the deck. So, I decided I wanted to hang it, but because of the silo, it doesn't hang evenly.  I guess I will just put it away until I can figure out where I want to place it...probably a pole."
5.0,So adorable...
5.0,A lovely addition to our feeder collection! Birds love it!
4.0,It's a good quality feeder. The birds love it. I hung my from a shepherds hook. The wire to hang it is very hard to use.  It hangs straight when full but crooked when the barn is empty but the silo is still full. All said i would definitely buy it again. Great quality for rhe price.
5.0,"not absolutely squirrel proof, but we don't care"
5.0,The birds love it!  It stays together good & looks great!

5.0,As listed Great Product Grand children loved playing with it
5.0,Birds love it.  Also like the design
3.0,"This barn birdfeeder is adorable and the color was bright when I purchased it originally.  Then the squirrels broke into the roof and wore the roof.  My husband jury rigged the latch to add reinforcements, but the color soon began to fade and, within less than two years, the barn does not look attractive, though it does still remain in use because of the new ""latch system"" rigged for it.  I love the design, but wish the material was more quality, versus the light plastic and color that fades quickly.  I shall be forced to replace it due to its appearance soon.  :-("
5.0,The birds love the barn feeder. Needs funnel to load the seed but all in all love  it
3.0,Ok
5.0,So cute.
1.0,This is a death trap for birds!  do not buy unless you enjoy finding dead birds in the feeder.  Their heads get trapped in under the well!
5.0,very good real happy
4.0,"Mine came with something small cracked on the silo portion but I didn't feel like the hassle of return or replace.  I would inspect it good out of the box.  Otherwise it is a cute addition to one's yard and the birds love the mix of larger kernels in the main section and smaller thistle in the silo portion.  I've found mounting on a pole to be the best, most sturdy option."
5.0,"Completely adorable addition to my bird feeders!  Very well constructed, comes already put together. Only thing you have to do is put hanging wires (which are included) on the barn and install either thistle seed perch or regular perch on the silo. Easy to fill both barn & silo. You can change silo perches easily & quickly.  Love being able to have thistle seeds & regular seeds in the same feeder. Highly recommend.  I will be purchasing a couple more!"
2.0,the hanging part of the was not very good (wires) I would not buy another  one
5.0,wife loved it
5.0,"I was a little skeptical of how long this plastic feeder would last since our squirrels have eaten every other plastic container.  However, it is doing very nicely, the critters haven't touched it!  My neighbors and I really appreciate its red color.  I think it might be a little difficult to wash, but not ass difficult as my little yellow finch feeder.
My only negatives are that it only can be filled from the little red square on top which takes longer to fill by spoonfuls instead of pouring.  And the short and widespread holders are hard for me to find a way to hang the feeder."
3.0,Squirrels knocked it down and the plastic sides shattered.  It's was really cute while it lasted.
2.0,"Came in with cracked spiral. I put masking tape over it and it still didn't stay together. The main barn works as it's supposed to, though."
5.0,I love it

Thank you so much for a quality product and great customer service.

5.0,"I have received all products in excellent condition, and the cost of the items were what was quoted."
5.0,Great!! We bought three of the bird feeders. They are just what we wanted. Good packaging and quick delivery.
5.0,"I have seen many comments about how ""difficult"" these are to fill with bird seed. That is not true, people just don't seem to know what to use to fill them. Since not everyone reads the questions above, I will place my suggestion here also, to help you. DONT THROW THEM AWAY ! All you need to do is go to any garden center, where you will find bird seed scoopers that are MADE for this type of bird feeder. Mine is a green scoop that has a piece at the middle of the handle that is designed to slide back and forth. You leave it in the closed position to fill the large section of the scoop, then you place the scooper with the thin handle end going into the opening for bird seed, then just slide the middle piece open and the seeds fall right through it into the bird feeder. This works for the silo as well as the barn section.

I found what I bought here on Amazon. It's called Perky Pet Quick Fill Bird Seed Scoop, hopefully this link will take you to the page.  http://www.amazon.com/Perky-Pet-342-Quick-Fill-Bird-Scoop/dp/B0002DK03W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1431023067&sr=8-2&keywords=Bird+seed+scoop+funnel"
3.0,"hard to fill, fell apart rather quickly"
5.0,"Not only adorable, but extremely well built.  the silo is separate from the barn, in that you can put in two types of seeds.  The silo comes with two types of perches; use depends on the type of seeds used in the silo.  the lids are attached so that you don't lose them, or the wind doesn't blow them off.  There are two sturdy long wires that you can use for hanging, but it's also possible to mound this on a post, if you have one.  The wires wrap (at each corner of the barn) down, under, then up the other side, so that when complete at both ends of the barn, you have two wires to hang it from.  This creates a sturdy feeder that the birds won't rock as they land and take off.  The fact that the wire wraps underneath each side, creates a very sturdy hanging system. Audubon approved.  I would definitely buy this again."
5.0,Exactly what we wanted!!
4.0,"My wife & I have owned several of these bird feeders. They last about 2 years before the squirrels get to them and chew them to pieces. These are pole mounted and have baffles on the poles so the squirrels actually climb nearby shrubs and jump on them. We trim the shrubs back to keep them from getting on them.
The tough part is the new ones we received have this giant sticker on the roof that does not come off easily. So we had to call the company to request new roofs for them as they looked terrible with sticky paper on the roofs. other than that they work great since they are pole mounted."
2.0,"Not very sturdy, feels like plastic.  The squirrels ate the little black plastic bird perches on the round part the first day out.  Must use a funnel to refill."
5.0,I like it
3.0,"This feeder is OK so far.  I've had it for a few months on a pole (not hanging) and the birds do seem to like it.  It's light plastic but has held up to a winter storm feeding frenzy assault by starlings so far.  I like that the 'silo' has ports that can be changed out for finch feeder holes or regular seed dispnesers.  I used it for niger seed with the small hole dispensers and the birds have emptied it (though I haven't actually witnessed any since I put it into a location I don't observe often).  The only problem I have so far is that when I take off the little red cupola top that lets you fill the main body, it has some sort of tube with openings that is probably supposed to help distribute the seed into different directions in the body of the barn.  And this tube clogs up unless I use the smallest seed and pour slowly.  We bought this to match our real life gambrel roof barn so it's fine and cute, but the slight hich in filling it is a small annoyance.  Not sure why they did that.  Other than that, I like that the little red fill port covers have cords attached so they don't fall away or get lost."
4.0,Attractive feeder but is hard to fill and not at all squirrel resistent
5.0,The feeder itself is very nice  The hanging device is useless
5.0,"The birds love it, however installing it was a problem.  I had a 1 inch PVC pipe already in the ground, but the pipe was too big to fit into the barn hole. The pipe starts to go on, but gets stuck as the hole it goes into tapers down to a smaller size.  Had to get a 3/4 inch pipe and a connection to put the two pipes together, then the 3/4 inch pipe slips right on and it fits tight.  Saw two of these at a store, appears to be a common problem that a 1 inch pipe is too large to fit all the way on."
4.0,"Nice looking, some assembly required but the hanging wire provided is rather stiff and difficult to bend, twist and secure. Other than that this is a handsome bird feeder and I look forward to viewing a lot of birds this winter and beyond."
4.0,Super cute!!!
3.0,Great birdhouse but the method of hanging it needs to be re-invented!!  Does not hang well!
5.0,"Our friends have many birdhouses, but nothing like this.  They loved it."
3.0,great size and very cute.  It holds a lot of bird seed.  The birds eat from the barn but have difficulty getting to the seed in the silo.  Material is cheap and easily breaks if dropped.  Probably wouldn't last long in harsh weather.  It needs to be on a fixed pole.  It wouldn't work swinging from a tree.  The seed would spill right out.
5.0,My baby brother (he;s actually 55) lives in the country and has quite a few birdhouses.  This was distinctive.  He likes it very much
3.0,too hard to load seeds
5.0,Thank you!
4.0,Took the birds a couple of days to use it-guess it had that new feeder smell.  Easy to fill and seems it would be easy to keep clean.  Looks nice.
1.0,"Awful. Arrived missing the two silo caps, and the whole thing was cheap looking. Amazon issued a full refund, however!"
3.0,Not quite as sturdy as it appeared in the picture. Did not come with anything to hang or mount it with. Nice design for a feeder though.
5.0,I have over 20 species of birds feeding from mine.  I still had to grease the pole though to keep the squirrels out.
4.0,"It was inexpensive and really cute.  Only drawback is the openings to fill the feeder is ,though adequate, could be a little largerthat would make filling it go faster."
2.0,cheap junk.
1.0,"Several times a bird got trapped under the well where the side panels come down. I was able to pry the feeder apart to release the birds. I thought this probably happened because the feed had run out and the bird got trapped by trying to get at some crumbs inside the feeder. I thought I could correct this problem by making sure there was always seed in the feeder. When I went out last night to refill the feeder there was another bird trapped inside of it. Since there was about 25 percent of feed left apparently the bird panicked and the feed smothered it so that it was already dead by the time I got to it.
Please do not buy this item. There is an apparent flaw in its design."
5.0,Very cute. Easy to fill and hang
5.0,this is great
5.0,my wife loves this feeded
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and with prompt delivery to boot.
2.0,Looks nice but cheap plastic material. Does not hang properly with wire provided
5.0,Pleased with it.
5.0,"Several years ago, a friend of mine had one of these bird feeders that he had obtained years ago.  It was falling apart.  My daughter had found one in Tractor Supply which she purchased two years ago. He wanted another one for his yard, but Tractor Supply did not sell them any more. He does not have a computer and I had the task of finding it on line.  I bought two, one for now and one as a spare.  He was thrilled as this particular model was better than what he had."
5.0,Looks just like the pic
5.0,Really cute feeder.  Good quality.  The golden finch love it (although not as much as the socks).  It looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,Beautiful and functional
4.0,"Love, Love, love the looks. Really bright and cute. What made me not give it 5 stars
was it is hard to fill. I waste a lot of seed trying to fill it. The birds seem to love it
so that is a good thing,"
4.0,"Very Cute, but plastic seems somewhat fragile.  Will require extra protection."
5.0,"Nice feeder. I have about 20 feeders and this is the nicest looking.  Fills easy, holds plenty of seeds and stands up well to the elements."
1.0,I tried to hang it with the two wires but it didn't work and left the bird house hanging at an angle.  It is a nice design but not having a proper way to hang it I had to give it away.  I don't suggest buying it for this reason.
5.0,The barn bird feed makes an excellent additon to our barn mail box.  Neighbors have expressed good comments on both items.
5.0,"The minute I saw it, I wanted it. and knew that the beauty, design and colors would attract the birds I have been feeding , and would bring more of their friends. Thanks for a wonderful product.

  RJM / FL"
4.0,I got this as a gift for my sweetie. We live on a farm and it fits the landscape real nice. Built sturdy for our N.Y. winters. Happy with feeder. Not to hard to fill and holds a lot of sead
5.0,"Great price, and the birds love.  My feeder actually looks like the picture with the golden finches.  Looks cute, and fits alot of food, birds seem to love it...At first the larger birds could not feed, but , not they have figured it out.  But, because there are some many golden finches they scare the blue jays away...which in my house is a BIG PLUS.."
5.0,"The highly versatile Dover Parkerburg 610 2- Gallon Galvanized Metal Water Bucket was recommended to me by my neighbor Jim Anchower. Jim is something of an amateur consumer products testing buff and assured me that when it came to galvanized buckets the Dover Parkersburg reigns supreme! Jim had previously turned me on to the the Swiffer WetJet Mop Total Cleaning System and the Hoover Quik-Broom S2561 so I knew he wouldn't [mess] around when it came to my metal bucket needs.
  At first glance the Dover Parkerburg 610 is clearly a step above the competition, the smooth galvanized exterior is indicative of the more modern electrocoat process which produces much less surface bubbling and insures a uniform surface. Jagged Edges? Not on this baby! Also of note are the two horizontal ripples which are placed 6 inches from the base. A simple structural analysis and crush test showed the slight corragative additions to be more than simple decorations, they actually produce an increase in tensile strength of 35.8% when compared to smooth walled galvanized buckets of the same carrying capacity.
  Although I have used the Dover Parkerburg less since installing our new fangled ""Water Closet"", I display it with pride, knowing that I own the best 2 gallon galvanized bucket in town."
5.0,"Being an afficianado and collector of buckets, I was ecstatic when I came across this 2 Gallon Galvanized wonder.  It's beauty and wonder cannot be overstated.  It is quite simply the Mercedes-Benz of buckets, if I may say.  I ordered this amazing product and the days spent waiting for it were probably the longest of my life.  When it finally arrived, I eagerly ripped open the box and tore off the paper covering the Dover Parkersburg 610.  All the packaging wasn't even necessary, because this bucket folks, hold on to your hats, is made of METAL!  That's right, 100% metal.  As advertised, it is quite capable of holding water, but that moniker is far too restrictive.  This versatile container can hold equal amounts of *any* liquid you can think of.  To test it's claim that it holds two gallons, I went out and bought two gallons of buttermilk from my local dairy vendor.  I poured both gallons of creamy goodness inside the 610, and to my surprise, it held both gallons!  Then, of course, I faced the problem of having to drink two gallons of buttermilk.  Long story short, the 610 was able to handle the resulting two gallons of vomit!  Days later, when I got out of the hospital, cleaning the 610 was no problem.  The galvanized surface made cleanup a snap.  I have found countless other uses for this versatile bucket since then.  Highly recommended!"
3.0,"This is/was a really cute bird feeder. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long. It's cheaply made and made out of cheap plastic. The removable lids to the barn and silo are flimsy and awkward, and the barn itself, already broke. Birds loved it, while it lasted!"
5.0,"Admittedly, the birds seemed to like the old wooden feeder better, but they are getting used to this one and using both the side and silo parts. The squirrels like it too. The post hole is tapered upward and square, so awkward to get balanced. I used a post within a post to manage it. It can hang too, but I chose a post mount. The plastic is thin, but not delicate. I don't expect more than a year or two of use before something breaks, but it's cheaper than the sturdier wood models and they do break and wear out too. As long as it keeps the birds visiting, I like it."
1.0,"This is cheaply made and is not easy to fill.  It a great idea, but...........  After using it once I gave it to my son in-law."
1.0,Very hard to hang from hook.  Bird perches in silo come out too easily and dumps the seed.  For the large capacity it is hard to fill.  Opening is very small.  But it looks cute.
5.0,I sent this as a gift and my cousin loved it.  In fact she raved about it so much I'm going to buy one for myself!
4.0,". . . I am a little worried about how it will hold up. The plastic is pretty thin. Time will tell. What I do like about it, though is that it has so many places for food."
2.0,"There is a flaw, in my humble opinion, in that the bird feeder and the pole assembly, recommended to be purchased with feeder, do not work properly when using one of the assembly methods.  I'll explain:  When placing the bird feeder atop the pole assembly, with the enclosed part that needs to be attached so that the feeder extends out to the side, does not take into consideration the ""weight factor"" of a full feeder.  I attempted to use this method, as opposed to the extended arm with slots for the wire provided to hang on the extended arm.  Unfortunately, shortly after hanging the feeder with the aforementioned method, the feeder broke off the base and crashed to the ground, breaking into many pieces rendering the newly purchased item unusable.  I'm not requesting a refund, even though I should get one, I'm simply trying to alert the seller of this manufacturing flaw - in my [non-designing] opinion.  END of my story."
5.0,I got this for my Dad for Christmas. He loved it. The entire family loved it also. It looks great in his yard.
4.0,This feeder is exactly as described. My husband loves it and can't wait to get a pole on which to mount it.
5.0,"Loved the design, the colors are bright and just as pictured.  I can't wait to hear if the recipient gets the birds he loves to watch to come to this feeder.  I thought this was a really novel, fun design. The silo acts as a storage and dispenser of the seed.  I would recommend this."
5.0,This is the fourth bird house of the Red Barn we have had. Two were smashed by bears and the last one was old and fell apart when dropped. We like how easy to fill and just the looks. Amazon was the only place we could find one. Looked but find no one carried one in the stores that sold bird feeders.
5.0,Feeder was just as cute when I received as it looked in the picture. My daughter-in-law had requested a bird feeder for Christmas as her old one was getting a little ratty looking. She loved this one and couldn't wait to get it put up. Would recommend.
3.0,it is pretty to look at but made with cheap cheap plastic I would never order again made so cheap & the price was high & some of the plastic already fell off of the roof I would never order again
5.0,This is our second barn - the first one was ruined by baseball sized hail.  We love it!  It is mounted on a pole right outside the kitchen window.
5.0,"Wanted to replace a feeder with a farm theme.  This was it.  Easy to assemble, well made and seemingly durable.  Easy to pole mount or hang.  Silo can be modified for finch food with perches included.  Great capacity.  Variety of birds use it daily
Great price for item sometimes featured with less than great prices.  Very happy with purchase.."
3.0,"The Barn Bird Feeder is absolutely adorable.  I love it.  However, the birds won't use it.  I had a wooden bird feeder for years in the same spot that I put the barn bird feeder.  But the birds won't come near it.  I called a Wildlife Rehabilitator in our area and she said it's because of the black roof.  From the bird's viewpoint, they see it as a large black crow and they are afraid of it.  I covered the roof with a tan cloth but they still won't come near it because they remember it was black.  It's been 6 weeks.  So I am very disappointed."
5.0,This is a large bird feeder.  It is nicely made and will be enjoyed by many a birds. Would recommend.
5.0,Along with my John Deer wind mill it is a nice reminder of being young on the farm in rural upstate NY in the 50's
2.0,"I would need to fill my old wooden feeder twice a week. The birds don't seem to like this one. It has been over a month and it is still not empty. The roof has started warping, and I live in Seattle so it's not that hot! I agree with other reviews that it is also difficult to fill."
4.0,"We are always looking for red barn items, so this really caught my eye.  It is cute, and I am pleased with the design of it.  It is lacking a star because I am pretty sure that it will not last very long.  The plastic seems pretty thin and not durable.  I would guess that if it is left out to feed the birds year round, we will have it for about a year before pieces start to get brittle and break."
5.0,It's a great bucket.  I've used it to burn top secret paperwork and to haul water in.  I'd recommend it to anyone that likes fire and water!
5.0,"We use this to hold the pie irons that are hot when we take them out of the fire. We haven't put water in it, so I don't know if it leaks, but its built well. I'm glad Amazon had one because I couldn't find a galvanized bucket anywhere locally!"
5.0,I have outhouse bathroom decor & this goes well in it. I use it for a trash can....perfect fit with everything!
5.0,"We recieved the pales that we ordered, perfect size and well made, to this day they still look new and I am very pleased with the price, as We are retired and have to be careful what we can buy."
3.0,"Another made in Mexico.

Noting special about this that I can see.
Suspect it will last a year, maybe two."
5.0,"I cannot wait for my buckets to arrive so that I can fill them with ice and  a few beers ,go sit in the yard under the big oak tree and enjoy the yard with a nice cold one. Much nicer eye appeal than your standard cooler. I love nostalgic garden accessories. They make me smile. : )"
2.0,"Luckily I did not buy this bucket to hold water, however if you are buying this as a water bucket look elsewhere."
5.0,"The Dover Parkersburg 610 Galvanized Metal 2 gallon water bucket makes a beautiful addition to my bucket collection. Last Christmas, my husband bought me the 12 quart (number 612 to bucket enthusiasts) and the 4 quart (number 1205). I was very excited, yet puzzled when my neighbor asked if it contained a diamond earrings or necklace from Jared's when I received it. This woman obviously has nil appreciation for a lovely bucket.
Previously, I focused on collecting antique buckets. I especially like the baked enamel ones, but it is hard to finds ones that have no chips or heavy wear. And buying even older wooden buckets has become cost prohibitive as a hobby. I fairly drooled last year when the colonial bucket discovered in the attic of Betsy Ross' former home went on the block at Christie's. My husband made me stop bidding at $10,000, saying that since we both have no jobs we need the money for heating, electricity and baby formula. I disagree, but we must all make our sacrifices in the name of a blissful marriage.
Brio's Metal Garden Pail (32125), also sold on Amazon, come in beautiful colors and are perfect for serving food at large parties, like gravy and vegetables at Thanksgiving. They are not only festive, but also are unbreakable and virtually spill proof.
I eagerly await fall 2010, when Dover Parkersburg is due to debut their fold up metal bucket, similar to a fold up travel cup. It will be a unique addition to my collection, and save on packing room when I'm headed to the National Bucket Enthusiasts' Convention. I highly endorse their product line."
3.0,It doesn't hold nearly as much as the Dover Parkersburg 12Qt Galvanized Metal Water Bucket 612. Don't be fooled by the lower price  - what a ripoff!
5.0,I'm very pleased with this bucket.  I've used it for everything outside  It's tough.
2.0,"I do not like this bird feeder, however, our birds do. When I first hung it up and filled it with bird seed, it fell apart. The only reasons we are using it are 1) I couldn't return it because we tried to use it and 2) my wonderful husband is a fix it man and was able to put it back together. It is cheap plastic, and not well made. This feeder is also difficult to fill, especially if you hang it. We tried to find a pole, but couldn't find one the right size. So it is awkwardly hanging on a shepherd's hook. Next time, I will buy a wooden feeder."
5.0,She loves birds and admired my old one so this was the answer for a gift. The person I sent it to was very pleased.
4.0,"I decided on this one after looking everywhere. It is nice to look at in our backyard. It is made in the USA which is rare for plastic things. I hope it will hold up well. My husband mounted it to a black metal pole. The squirrels have not bothered it. It took a little while for the birds to start using it but now it's great to see ones I haven't seen before. I got the Nat. Geo guide to backyard birds and have used it alot. This one does seem lightweight but it is secure for now on the pole. I hope it holds up and glad I chose this one. Thanks Amazon:)
Update: It is hard to clean!! Had to take apart:( Not fun."
5.0,I bought this for my niece and her husband for Christmas.  She wanted a bird feeder and had pointed this one out when we were going through items on Amazon.  I bought it and her husband installed it right outside one of their windows.  They love it!  It really is cute and seems to be made very well.
5.0,"Our neighborhood birds are enjoying this bird feeder everyday. Lots of fun to watch them. Easy to fill, easy to put up"
5.0,"The squirrels ate a hole in the bottom of my previous feeder like this and there was no replacement, so had to purchase the entire feeder,  Looks great."
4.0,"this was for the wife and she loved it, have not installed it yet its to cold out to put up a bird feeder"
5.0,I bought 2 of these one for my mother and one for my mother. They were exactly how they were discribed and the were delivered in just a couple of days. That was at Christmas timen
5.0,Holds just the right amount of feed;  lets me use reg feed and thistle seed in one unit; easy to fill with a secure closure; and the birds love it!
3.0,The bird feeder is very hard to keep level as it is hanging. The hanging wires seem too stiff.  It is difficult to get seed into it and much drops to the ground. I have another where part of the roof lifts up which is very easy to fill.
3.0,Has a nice look and works fine but hard to fill. The tower fills easy. But filling under the roof is difficult. My wife stopped using it because of that.
5.0,It is very homey and makes a great addition to your yard.  It holds a lot feed so you don't have to fill it as often
5.0,"It is absolutely beautiful, I have it on a post in front of my kitchen window.  It is attracting many birds!"
4.0,"This is a very nice bird feeder.  One must devise a way to make it squirrel-proof, otherwise a squirrel will destroy it."
5.0,"Very timely delivery.  Looks just as advertised.  The son for whom I ordered it has a ""red barn"" that looks similar to this and he will love it.!"
3.0,"not bad but some parts fell apart within the first week
I would not buy another one but I do not regret buying it

UPDATE: After a while, I find it pretty hard to get the seeds in the feeder. You better have an entonnoir or something to help you near because otherwise you will swear! Also the tower on the side is pretty useless and broke soon after installing it."
3.0,"I love the look of this bird feeder.  Unfortunately, we have a lot of wind in the winter and the top would frequently blow open.  One storm knocked it off it's post and the clear plastic broke.  If you have a protected place to put it, it really is cute and holds a lot of seed."
1.0,It looks great but the squirrels were able to take this apart within a month. I would buy something else instead.
5.0,"Purchased the feeder as a gift for my sister.  The numerous birds around her house seem to love it, and it holds a good amount of seed, so doesn't have to be filled too often.  I'm sure the clientele will enjoy it even more this winter -- and winters to come."
3.0,"product was as specified, delivered on time and was worth the amount paid. I was satisfied with the product and it apprears the birds, and oft times squirrels enjoy it also!"
5.0,"I bought the longer, 26"" handled version of this axe  from Home Depot (not the 16"" shown here). This American made tool (made in USA or U.S.A.) was designed to last. This axe is lightweight but can easily cut through both wet and dry hard woods. The molded handle is surely the most comfortable I've ever felt on an axe. This very portable axe is what you are looking for if you want to fell trees, split wood or re-split firewood into kindling. However, I wouldn't attempt to use this axe to smack a wedge through big logs. It is light enough to use one-handed for hammering pegs etc. I'm assuming that it's by no coincidence that the longer version of this axe also has a rounded handle segment in the middle that you can ""choke up"" on to gain better control of the swing for hammering or for close cutting/hewing; it is light and controllable. Although none is shown in the picture, mine came with a leather sheath; all of the ones I've seen in stores do. It comes with a sharp factory edge and sharpens to a ridiculously sharp edge in a few passes from one of those V-shaped knife/tool sharpeners&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Accu-Sharp-060-GardenSharp-Tool-Sharpener/dp/B000IXC6GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Accu Sharp 060 GardenSharp Tool Sharpener</a>(Accusharp). Estwing did their homework when designing and manufacturing this axe and you won't be disappointed with this choice. It is one of those rare examples of quality better than you would expect for the price."
5.0,"I use this as a personal tool for firefighting, and it works great.  No problems using it for breaching walls, opening drywall.  Nice striking surface for forceful entry.  Light and compact enough to not get in the way or slow me down, but enough power to get the job done.  Solid construction.  Leather sheath.  No reservations.

I also use it for chopping firewood at home and for all but the biggest stuff it works great."
5.0,"The estwing axe is a serious tool for making fire wood for our Buck stove. I'm a senior citizen and cannot deal with a big axe so this one does the job on small unplit wood as well as big stuff 18"" long. I had a small leather covered handle one but would just bounce off the hard wood. This one should last for many years to come. Don't skimp on essentials. Amazon sent it to me in quick time and in perfect condition."
5.0,"As expected from an Estwing product, this axe performs very well and is a well-balanced striking instrument.  I used it to fell a 12"" diameter tree with no problem - actually quite enjoyable.  The only drawback is that when you strike very hard dead wood, it does vibrate some (not a problem with live wood).  I recommend the Fiskars sharpener for $10 - got the blade very sharp with this tool.  Also consider the Fiskars Pro Chopping axe which got great reviews.  FYI, supposedly the world's finest axes are from Gransfors Bruks in Sweden."
5.0,"I have and have used a wide variety of hand tools.  I can tell you that this product is made of the highest quality, and will give you a lifetime of good service with minimal maintenance.  Highly recommended."

5.0,"I have and have used a wide variety of hand tools.  I can tell you that this product is made of the highest quality, and will give you a lifetime of good service with minimal maintenance.  Highly recommended."
2.0,The feeder is very hard to fill with sunflower seeds.  It also had a strange way for hanging it on a pole.
4.0,"Looks really good, seems sturdy enough, the hanging wires that came with it leaves alot to be desired so I hung it with coated speaker wire that my son left at my house when he moved out. It holds alot of bird seed so I only have to fill it up once a week as opposed to every other day with a smaller bird feeder. I will recommend this bird feeder."
5.0,This is great. The big birds are having a hard time getting to the food. Now the little birds get some food and the big birds have to eat off the ground.
2.0,"I purchased this item in March because i liked the design/concept and the reviews were good.  I found it a hassle pouring the bird food in the little square hole and the plastic was very cheap. In June after filling the feeder & putting it back on the pole, it fell & the plastic broke and all the food wasted on the ground.  I would not recommend buying this product..but if you do because you think it is ""cute"" only fill the feeder half way...but it is very poor quality for the price you pay!!! Aarrgggghhhhhhh!!!!!!"
5.0,"Love love love it? It is great to look at, the birds are attracted to it , easy to fill and would buy it again and recommend to others"
5.0,"I LOVE THIS FEEDER.THE BIRDS LOVE IT.ALOT OF BIRDS CAN FEED AT THE SAME TIME.IT IS EASY TO FILL.ALSO, IT LOOKS GREAT IN THE YARD."
5.0,I had no problem hanging this and haven't had any problems with squirrels. It's a cool looking bird feeder and I like it a lot. I didn't want a simple and boring bird feeder.
1.0,Hanging devise provided is terrible.  Difficult to fill with sunflower seed.  Flimsy and poorly constructed. Hard to believe its made in the US.
5.0,I had one of these barns before and I loved it So had to get another one. as when I moved I didn't bring it with me  Thanks for a great producy  Alvina
5.0,"Except for our new kitten this feeder is the cutest thing I've seen in a long time.  It's good sized, larger than I expected, very colorful - just like the picture, very sturdy (considering it's plastic), and I like the idea of the optional perches for the silo - two regular or two small ones for thistle feeding. I also bought the Perky-Pet 5107 pole kit which fits into the feeder like a glove.  The feeder was delivered yesterday (08/23/11), fewer than 5 days from date of purchase.  I'm very, very pleased with my purchase and can't wait to set it up, load it up and watch to see how our fine-feathered friends like it.  Hope this was helpful.  If you get one I guarantee you'll like it."
4.0,"Nice unit - no complaints.  But this weekend I saw one at Menard's that had pneumatic tires for less money & wonder if I should have bought that instead?  The plastic tires will slip if you spread on wet grass.  If you're like me, trying to beat a rain shower to get the fertilizer to sink in, you'll occasionally be on wet grass.
It beats the heck out of the spreader I had before, but I imagine there's better.  Costs too much to find out I think.  It's just a speader."
2.0,"I'm blown away at all the good reviews of this spreader.  I received it, and will use it until it breaks, but my old Scott's brand was way better.

Pro's:  It's built solidly enough

Con's:

1.  It has no lever, like most I've owned that stops the spreading when crossing your driveway or side walk etc.  You have to lift the spreader up on the left wheel so the right wheel doesn't rotate.  However, even when you do, you have a 4"" stream of product across the hard pavement. How ridiculous!

2.  I have spread different size pellets for different things, and when you open the slots, no matter how slightly, it leaves a 4"" high X 4"" in diameter pile of product.
2a.  When I spread Moss Preventer the other day, it would not spread, and I kept have to lift up the spreader and firmly hit the ground with it so it would start again.  I had to do this the entire time I was putting the stuff down.  What a piece of junk.

3.  The directions are very clear, on what setting to choose, however, it doesn't correspond to anything close to a slow even spread.

Overall, I could not have been more displeased or disappointed with a product.  You know the drill though, it's a pain to return stuff, so I'll lift and tilt and struggle with this until it's time to get something new.  I would have given this a 1 STAR, but it wasn't made flimsily, so I'll be charitable.  Whoever designed this needs to be fired.  A spreader where the settings are wrong, that doesn't spread evenly, that leaves lines and piles everywhere, and that jams constantly is probably not the best design in the world."
3.0,This is a great spreader but I strongly reccomend getting the one with rubber tires.  The plastic wheels slip and you don't get an even distribution.
5.0,Worked as advertised. Well made and easy to use. It made short work of feeding my half acre lawn.
5.0,I have just gotten my Earthway 2050SU spreader and was very pleased with how simple and sturdy the spreader is.  It is ver easy to set  the regulator and I was elated that it somes completely assembled.  It seems to be very sturdy and I expect it will last for a long time to come.
5.0,I am very happy with this Earthway spreader. I bought it to replace a Scotts Speedy Green and the Earthway works much better. The hopper dispersal system is a better design and spreads the chemicals more evenly than the Scotts model I had. For $55 this is a great product.
5.0,"This solves all my fert problems and at a great price, I highly recommend
this fert spreader."
5.0,"While getting ready for our fall lawn fertilizing, our old spreader disintegrated on the spot when we got it out after our move.  No stores carried any spreaders by this time of the year so we checked Amazon & sure enough we found one that had a good feedback so decided to take a chance.  I placed the order & it was one of the quicker than usual shipments which was great!  We checked it all over & it was all it promised to be, so we want to add a 5* for this spreader...actually much better quality than any we've seen in the stores previously.  My husband is very pleased!"
5.0,Super price on a better than average axe!
5.0,I have had the e45a camp axe for 4 years now and it's a beast. I use it once a week
5.0,"Forget your 3.5 lb. blunderbuss axes where you pound your way through the wood. Leave those for when you chop up roots. The Estwing axe is designed more like the small axes for canoeing in Canada. The head in those is 1.25 lbs. with a wood handle which made them light enough to carry while portaging with all your other gear. They are designed to slice into the wood not break it apart.  They also would be good battle axes, I suppose.
  The Estwing Axe is designed very much like that canoeing axe. The profile of the head is slender and shaped more like the razors your great grandfathers used, thereby offering less resistance while cutting into the wood.
  Use of this axe is more to slice the wood so your swing is at a sharper angle with the grain of the wood than with a conventional axe, which cuts more perpendicularly to the grain.
  When I use mine (I have 3 of them) plates of wood fly off that are up to 8 inches wide.  Because the velocity is so much higher than with a conventional axe you achieve higher energy therefore greater cutting power (E=MxCSquared). For limbing they are better than a chainsaw. If dropping a bigger tree I use my chainsaw and then use the Estwing axe to limb out the tree except for the biggest limbs. For smaller trees just use the Estwing axe. It will save you time and no messing around with the saw, gas and oil. It really is the best axe in the world."
5.0,Merica 
3.0,Coating was crap. Runs and sags all over and missing in a few spots. I suppose its not a big deal because Im going to beat the crap out of this thing and I know it will hold up to it.
4.0,I am taking it on trip in 3 weeks so far love it.  Will up date when I get back on how it holds up.
5.0,Awesome axe. Great size and weight for homeowner use such as splitting seasoned firewood and chopping out small tree roots. Seems well made and blade is durable and seems to stay sharp. I like the ergonomic handle to absorb shock on my carpal tunnel wrists. Good axe! Markkowaleski.com
5.0,I own several Estwing hammers. They are simply the best!
5.0,"What else needs to be said, it's an Estwing."
5.0,Solid one peice tool. USA made! I love it!
5.0,"Don't know why I didn't replace the Scott spreader sooner (2013) - dispenses much more fertilizer is a much shorter time, great on uneven ground. Follow up review - noticed when fertilizer was lumpy it didn't spread very well (2016), seems it was missing an agitator pin.  Called the company and had free replacement(s) in less than a week.  Not only is it a great spreader the company provided excellent customer service."
1.0,This broadcaster fell apart after one use. The cover over the gears in the axle came off which also kept  the inside spinner to work. Cheap foreign junk if you're planning on seeding and fertilizing spend the money and buy something worth having.
4.0,I would rate this broadcast spreader a 9 out of 10.  The plastic wheels do not grip hard surfaces well.
3.0,Works with grass seed because it is fine.  Mix the seed with soil and no matter how wide it is opened it does not scatter well.
1.0,"The spreader is hard to push through the grass. It has no traction, and it tips over very easily, even if it's not filled very much. Go with a Scott's spreader."
5.0,i through out my nitrogen with this spreader as soon as i got it in the maul. it worked great
5.0,"very nice, with a good price i get . the only bad is this is made by plastic not by metal , but still good for home use ."
4.0,"I first tried the Scotts Edgeguard Mini Spreader but the agitator broke the first time I used it.  I then tried the Earthway model 1950 but one of the wheels fell off twice during the first use.  Earthway offered to send a part free of charge to fix the wheel but I decided to try the 2050SU.
The 2050SU is better because:
1) The hopper holds more - less refilling.
2) Larger diameter wheels - helps when going over bumps on the ground.
3) The whole unit is bigger - I can stand up straighter and due to the longer handle, I'm less likely to kick it when using it.
The top side edges of the hopper are straight so I can clamp on a piece of plywood to create my own edge guard to prevent weed control products from landing on my perennials.
I'd prefer the performance of a professional spreader but can't justify the cost for a home lawn.  I've used my 2050SU twice on my 14,000 sq. ft. lawn and so far, I'm happy with it."
5.0,"I just bought a ""well used"" older model off Craigslist. It has a very large hopper and extra large wheels. It shows some wear but still works fine. I'm very pleased with the quality."
5.0,For the reasonable price this spreader is well made.  I've used it a couple of seasons now with never a problem.  I highly recommend this spreader.
1.0,My spreader just broke when I went to use it for the 5th time. The lever that controls the flow rate broke.  I am very disappointed in this product.
5.0,"For the price and quality, this puts the comperable Scotts spreaders to shame. This one is built very solid and should last a very long time. I never heard of Earthway before but now I see they have a very good reputation."
4.0,"This is very good tool for the price, it handle the terrain as well as any expensive tool. I use it for over seeding and fertilizing my yard."
1.0,"I got this as a gift to replace a 10-yr old Speedy Green, which had eventually just fallen apart. The Earthway definitely has a broader spread and a larger capacity bin, but those are the only pros. The cons are, the quality of the materials and components are identical (as far as I can see) to what you can by cheaper at Lowes or HD---plastic wheels, plastic bin, same plastic agitator components. Hopefully over the long run, it is more durable than it appears.

The biggest flaw in this spreader is in the dispersement method. The controls are not a squeeze handgrip, but a lever lower on the bars. You must walk at a very even pace to get even coverage. If you stop, back up, or even slow down for a moment, you will get spillage. The only way to prevent this is to push with one hand, and leave one hand down on the controls. Unless you happen to have a large flat lawn with no obstacles, you will find this virutally impossible to do, especially when the bin is full and heavy.

Bottom line, this spreader costs a little more money but does not provide more quality and provides less performance.

Update: Had to throw away after one season. A winter in the garden shed caused the control wire to rust up and it is now unusuable. Others have reported this as well."
5.0,This spreader is much lighter and easier to maneuver than the last one I owned. I am very pleased with it.
5.0,"I had an almost new scotts spreader and it broke on me. I decided to try something different. Since I didn't have much of a choice in the community besides big box stores that only sold scotts, I decided to go online and see if there were more choices. Friends, you do have a choice. I bought this Earthway, with free shipping I might add, and it was at least ten dollars cheaper than anything I could find out in my community and MUCH MORE STURDY. It works better than any spreader that I have ever owned and I've owned several. Today, I spread 10-10-10 fertilizer, set it on 14, and wow what a job!!!!! Pelletized Lime set on 11 worked great! Washed it up and dryed it down and it is ready to use again. This spreader comes pre-asembled and ready to use out of the box, just fold up the handles and lock em down. For the price, you can't beat it. I'm sure there are better ones, but this one gets the job done."
4.0,"I was tired of always conforming to the ""scotts"" thing.  My old scotts speedygreen spreader was in need of replacement. It had become innacurate and was jamming.  This spreader felt better and looked REAL right out of the box. My wife took it out and it was ready for use in 2 minutes. The ONLY thing I lik better about scotts is the dial settings. Because this is not made by a chemical manufacturer you need to calculate your setting based on material and square footage. It works though.  It is sturdy! I loaded it up and rolled wherever I wanted with no trouble. Some people have said the wheels slip, I don't see it. Ive had it for only two days so I cannot speak on longevity. I spread grass seed and fertilizer. had no problem with either. I will say that with the scotts AND with this, there is a flat spot where the material exits, so you have to work at getting the last bunch out of the hopper. I don't think you can avoid this unless you get one that is funnel shaped or you use a drop spreader which I refuse to do with a 1/2 acre. 45 bucks was a great deal for this spreader."
1.0,I bought on the basis of the positive reviews and since no local stores carry a spreader off season.  I used the spreader a couple of times and would hose it off after use.  Today I discovered that the cable that controls the output apparently rusts.  I'm not able to open or close the control at all now as the cable is borken.  Curious as to what the positive reviewers are doing?  Do you not rinse or do you somehow towel dry your cabling?  Maybe a good soaking of WD-40? I'm off to the big box store...
5.0,"Quality construction with easy operations.  Large wheels for easy movement, large hopper, soft comfortable grip."
4.0,"This is the first spreader I've purchased. The only complaint I have is that there should be a clicking mechanism built into the setting rate slider. The slider is secured by a wingnut which you manually tighten to lockdown, but if your not careful it's easy to silently dislodge while your using the spreader. There is a manual lever that you'll use to open/close the grate for the spreader to avoid dumping the material your spreading during turns or if your crossing pavement. It's when your opening the grate with the lever that there is a risk of dislodging the wingnut and causing you to start spreading out at a much higher rate than you intend to. It's not really a big deal if your spreading out the same compound since you'll know visually if there is something wrong. For the first timers though pay attention."
5.0,Great axe for cutting wood and chopping!
5.0,The best!!!!! I've had several others but this one beats them all.
5.0,Really great product!!!!!!
4.0,"I don't know if Amazon is calling this a splitter or if that's coming from Estwing but trust me- this is not much of a splitting axe.  Just look at the way it's built, too thin for that.  Sure, it will split small stuff but it's not a wedge.  However, it chops pretty well!  The thinner blade does cut.  Mine didn't have a very good edge nor an even grind when I got it but a bit of work on my belt grinder and it took a shaving sharp edge.  That edge was too thin to stand up to use though so I took it down a bit til I got a good balance of sharpness and durability.

Overall for the price this is a pretty decent axe.  It's no GB but at the price you shouldn't expect that."
3.0,I hope you like chopping kindling.
5.0,love it...
4.0,"After breaking an axe handle and a hatchet handle I decided to go with the all metal drop forged camping axe. Honestly I've handled a lot of axes and hatchets over the years. When you hold this axe it feels like quality. That being said there are some aesthetics that aren't 100% these are hand ground so some grinds aren't perfect and the head is covered with clear coat so the edge needs a little sharpening before you take her out for the first time. But honestly the edge sharpened quick and easy with a fine stone. So sharp in fact I almost cut the whole tip of my finger off by accidentally touching the blade when oiling it. This is a tool. It's not going to be perfect. But it's a workhorse. It doesn't split that well due to the longer edge of the blade but it chops well enough for me. I've split 8 inch round logs with it with little force and energy. The handle is comfortable and it does vibrate a bit but eh Man Up or wear a glove and you will be fine. I chopped with it all day and I survived with no pain. This isn't a logging axe, your not going to be chopping huge redwoods down with this baby but it will easily fall a smaller tree with no problem. The edge seems to last a good while. In my opinion it's a high quality tool MADE IN USA by a company that has been making tools for a long while. Is it a 300 dollar high end axe no. It's a 40 dollar high end axe that gets the job done. I've seen some pics of these being bent or broken. I tried to replicate the problem as soon as I got this one because I don't like surprises when I'm miles away from civilization. I couldn't get it to break or bend. I threw everything I had at it and she begged for more. I'm sure I will be carrying and using this baby the rest of my life. Look no further, invest in a lifelong friend and companion today for a small fee of 39 dollars. You won't regret it."
5.0,Great camping axe.
4.0,Good but- Heavy!  Wish I would have bought a lighter axe.
5.0,"A beast.  Haven't used it yet, but looks and feels like you would expect.  Have had the hatched for years and love that, so figured it was time to try the ""full size.""  I expect good things."
5.0,Made in the USA! Enough said! This Estwing axe is the best axe Ive ever used. It stays mounted in my FJ Cruiser and I go camping almost every weekend. Very easy to sharpen and holds an edge very well. Perfect size for me at 26. Weight is perfect and balanced just right. The blade cover is very well made with two snaps to keep it secure. The axe handle is very comfortable and has a great grip while chopping wood. Very happy with my purchase. Buy it! You will like it knowing its made in the USA and not cheap China steel.
5.0,Very Rigid- Light enough for backpacking.
3.0,Too small to split larger logs but much better than a hatchet. Will be useful splitting 5 inch or less logs and for camping.  Probably should have spent more money for a bigger Axe to meet my needs.
4.0,"I like having all metal. It's great to have the rubber on the handle too. You can do a lot when you really know how to use an axe, and a lot of people prefer wider heads and wood handles to get a wide variety and a lot of work done with one tool. It would be easier to do splitting type tasks if this axe head wasn't so thin. Saves weight that the handle takes up I guess. It's definitely made for camping, as in take it somewhere and don't worry about the handle breaking, or slippery wood. If you prop wood up the right way you can split it with this axe but I recommend sharpening it to have a ""duller"" or ""more rounded"" edge as opposed to the more knife-like grind that makes it easy to get this thing really stuck in the wood, and makes it easier to get big dents or even chips in the edge when your camping buddies hit rocks with it. But if you want to use this to chop trees down quick and strip branches off logs fast, leave that edge steep and sharp and you'll see where this axe makes its money. the smaller version is fun to throw too, no wood handle to break."
5.0,"This thing is a beast, solid and super rugged just like their hammers. All one solid piece of steel, but the handle is cushioned well by the rubber grip so do not worry about a hard impact. Came razor sharp."
5.0,Bad ass
5.0,"I am no lumber jack, i am no lumber specialist.

I am an outdoorsman to the sense that i camp. Got this mostly cause it looks good on the back of my jeep

Lightweight and sharp, perfect for splitting the wood i buy at the store for camp fires"
5.0,"Brand new item. Great, shiny look with sheath. Feels good in my grip. Easily swings in my hands."
5.0,Love the metal shaft
5.0,this tool is metal from he head all the way through the handle -- well made -- good balance
5.0,Estwing quality
5.0,Perfect size axe
5.0,"I have been camping cross country and I have been able to cut through some incredibly dense, rubbery, wood with this axe.  For instance, it allowed me to have a campfire in the rain forest outside of Volcano National Park.  I also use the axe to adjust the position of embers and logs in the campfire."
3.0,Not really a wood splitter since it has a slender blade that will stick instead of split. But it is what I needed and very good quality. Sharp.
5.0,Nice tool.
5.0,"Love the balance, fit and weight of this ax.  Gave one each as Christmas presents to my two boys who camp, hike, have their own homes and have  young families who they take on outdoor activities.  One in Alaska and one in Eastern Washington.  These are best used for light tree chopping. branch trimming and kindling splitting.  The handle is long enough that one does not  short circle swing  and cut  a leg or foot as when using a short handle hatchet. Great grip for all around use. Great vibration control and the handle will not normally break under  average use."
5.0,REDRUM! REDRUM!!!
5.0,I love estwing products and this one is no different. Some might not like that its one solid piece of metal. But I do even though the axe might be a little heavy it's totally worth caring into the woods especially if it's winter.
5.0,"Great quality, Heavy, money well spent"
5.0,beautiful and solid.  Love it.
5.0,"The extended handle length will work out well as a camp ax. Lighter overall, but length to power the swing. Will be good for splitting campfire wood."
5.0,Nice n sharp feels right!!
5.0,There are zero negatives for this as a camping axe or to carry around your property and do small jobs.
5.0,"Perfect for my hurricane relief trip where I clear lots of vegetation.  This axe was very sharp and cut straight through 1-1/2"" diameter trees with one swing and some 2"" .  It is the perfect weight for a good swing and has great leverage"
5.0,"Awesome, never have to worry about breaking another handle again.  This is number 2, going to leave it out at our ranch.  We have had our other one outside for the past 5 winters and it is still going strong."
5.0,Didn  buy this but got it as a gift and its a good axe but its not heavy for splitting hard wood I  heat with wood and tryed tried it out its good for cuting light duty good for takeing hiking/camping i had to work it down to get it sharp
5.0,"Amazing product.  Im the king of breaking handles and this is impossible to break striking wood.
I would buy another if i ever need to.  Wish they made 36 inch for splitting wood."
5.0,"Bought this as a field axe and it works beautifully.  Not heavy and just enough reach for those cuts you don't want to finish with your saw.  I even used it to split some decent size knotty logs with no worries, even though I wouldnt recommend for splitting due to its light weight.  Also very little vibration."
5.0,"I was hesitant to buy this, i couldn't understand whod spend this much on an axe...i bought it anyways and when I got it, I was amazed how awesome that axe is! I'd so buy it again, it's cool!"
5.0,"I have wanted this axe for a long time. Estwing products are the best. Shipped quickly and boxed for safety. Fairly sharp, better with a touch up. Shorter handle good for different aspects of splitting and cutting wood."
5.0,"Great Axe. Very durable, holds an edge very well.  The head is thin yet strong so you can slide right through wood with ease. Definitely my favorite axe."
5.0,This is my second one. First one was left at camp and Ill get it back next time I go up there. Solid enough to split kinking and medium logs. Easy to swing. Took 5 minutes with a trihone block to make it sharp enough to shave. Easy to keep sharp in the woods. Get a file for dings and a puck to maintain the blade for bigger jobs. Black finish is kinda cheesy but doesnt affect performance.
5.0,"Perfect all-around tool.

I have shorter & longer axes. This one gets the most use. Love it so much, I bought a back-up.

Overall, Estwing is a terrific value.

Thank you, Estwing."
5.0,"Got this for my father and he loves it! Solid, Couldn't AXE-for more out of this item!"
5.0,Best axe ive bought
2.0,Poorly made.  Handle is messed up and scratches all over the blade.  Will be returning.
2.0,"Im tough on my axes, but the blade broke after the first camping trip, used to split cedar logs, do not buy a non cold forged blade"
5.0,"Thought I'd share a review of this great axe.  I have tested several camp style axes to include council, gransfors, and several other estwing axes while camping over the past few years.  I have to say this is one great camp tool.  It's super tough, takes a great edge, and performs admirably on all types of trees.  I just finished my review of the worst camp axe in the bunch, the Gransfors small Forrest axe.  That overpriced and overhyped Swiss fancy steel can't hold a candle to any of the estwing line.  I seriously doubt the people who review those products even work them in the field.  I've been able to chop 10 times the amount of wood with this in a fraction of the time with this axe.  You can get 4-5 estwing tools for the price of maybe one gransfors haha.  To be fair the estwing head shape isn't always the best for hard woods and it does need to be sharpened, but it works well enough on everything to make your family camp out successful.  I also have seriously worked this axe and haven't damaged anything.  The handle is great and super strong.  I liked it so much that I bought the short handled version as well.  I am confident my kids can't break it and it's nice to know an axe head won't go flying.  If you're looking for a tough American made tool for camping or your truck, I highly recommend it."
5.0,"If ya thinking about it, BUY IT! What handy tool, this axe has some bite, tough well balanced keeps a good edge easy to sharpen. & I say tough cause I tested it, & it passed by far. 20 something inch thick branches no problem, got'em down with chainsaw rope but chopped them to pieces with the Estwing! It says campers Axe, but wow this thing will handle what ever u can. I recommend this product. Looks koOL too."
5.0,This is a great axe. Very glad I bought it but only one downside. The black finish comes off very easy. I used a little goof off to remove a barcode sticker. It took paint clean off. Not a deal breaker as I have already put some wear on the axe finish using it. It does the job it was intended for. Nice weight.
5.0,excellent product! edge is sharp and axe is easy to handle
4.0,Nice camp axe.
5.0,No better axe out there.
4.0,"This arrived in good condition, and with an obvious large scratch,. Sounds like I'm being a bit picky, but i think the black finish is a rust preventative.  I very much like the hatchet.  I got this hatchet because of the theory that every inch of legnth, multiplies the power at the blade or bit."
5.0,Great product
2.0,I received a scuffed up axe with signs of small use and a long dark brown streak on the blue rubber handle. There are also silver scores on the blue neck of the axe and it came with dirt and sand on it.
5.0,Fckn awsome axe!! Everyone is other reviews complaining abt the head flying tf off the handle... Not with with axe. Very nice size and in my opinion a great typical axe. The only thing i wish was there was more options with it. Like a leather sheath and a black coating option.
5.0,Awesome axe!  Well made and comes ready to go.  Makes easy work of limbs and small trees.
5.0,I have 5 buldging discs in my back and i can still split wood with this. Thank God. I really like this. The powder coating has held up nice. Im greatful i paid the money for this. Im going to buy either this one again or the blue one like it. My son really likes this as well so i gave it to him. He promised to let me borrow it so we are both happy.
5.0,my husband uses this on every camping trip to split wood for our campfires!!  he really likes it!
5.0,Excellent Tool.  This is great for limbing and lighter chopping tasks.  I take this out with my bigger axe when I go after trash trees.
5.0,It is a great axe made by a great company.  With a solid steel shank it won't break any time soon.
5.0,Man you can build a log cabin with this bad mamma James
5.0,"This axe is great.  I'm using it now to debark several cords of wood I have in my back yard. It's light, easy to control and get's the job done. I have also split a few smaller logs (8""-10"" diam.) and did so with little effort.  I'm sure it could tackle larger logs as well.  I'm very happy with the performance of this axe and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light weight camper's axe."
5.0,"Nice quality, good size to mount in a truck, and it even resists rusting fairly well. Take care of it properly and it will stay corrosion-free and sharp. Buy a set of sharpening stones and some oil, learn how to use them."
5.0,"It's an Estwing, so the quality is amazing. The grip feels great in the hand."
5.0,Very handy axe. Keeps its edge. Just wish I would of ordered the hatchet as well. Very good quality.
5.0,"I use this along with my fiskars axe. This one is best for chopping, my fiskars is good for splitting."
5.0,Tough enough to be the only one the guys want ordered for work.
5.0,Perfect for my use...
4.0,Easily chipped. Or my girlfriend can't chop wood properly
3.0,Nice axe but not of Estwing quality I expected.
5.0,"I am a Canadian Canoe Guide in the summer and have led trips in northern Ontario for nearly 20 years. An axe in my pack is always one of my important tools from clearing portages to camp firewood, my axe gets used every day.  I recently switched to an Estwing 26 inch Camper Axe because over the years, my wooden handled axes ended up rotting over time from sitting in water at the bottom of the canoe.  The Estwing's all steel handle is an outstanding design, super durable and is my go-to tool.  The only complaints that I have, is that the head is a bit thin for splitting wood and can bury deep in softer wood, and when the axe is old and worn as mine is, it is hard to see when you put it down in the woods to gather an armload of firewood.  Also I wish it were about 3 inches shorter because when I have it on the side of my pack and I roll my canoe up to my shoulder, the handle catches the gunnel and often bumps up against the inside of the canoe when I carry it.  The first two complaints are easy to remedy by just not using it to split and by putting some bright tape on the handle - mine is a bit worn and all of the blue came off.

I recently bought the same exact Estwing for my wife who is also a northwoods canoe guide and she loves it.  She and I have used Gransfors axes for years and she finally retired her shorter handles Gransfors for the Estwing.

I would highly recommend this axe for backwoods travel and when I am not on trail, it lives under the seat of my 4x4 - ready for action.

Sno Dawg"
1.0,Not happy had to return twice because of chips in the blade or the head I finally ask for a refund
5.0,This axe is great!  Comes almost sharp enough to shave your face. Don't let the price scare you-it's worth every penny
5.0,Perfect Length sharp great price
4.0,Tke ax is great but the handle could use a little better craftsmanship.
5.0,Love it!
4.0,"I bought this for camping, and man....do I like it for the most part. I filed it immediately just in case, and it was sharp as hell. I was worried it wouldn't split semi-seasoned hard wood, but it went right through it for the most part. It did occassionally get stuck, which was annoying, and I had to pound on it with a hammer to get it out. Which brings up a point: it had visible damage from the hammering, nothing major, but the hammer was fine, which makes me think the axe steel isn't as strong as the metal in my hammer, or the weaker metal would have been the one getting damaged. Still, it held up very well and I'm not 100% I should have been pounding on the axe like that anyway. If the head was wider, or more angled, perhaps it wouldn't have gotten stuck that bad anyway. I'm not an axe expert though, but just from a layman's point, it cut through a 2-3"" diameter live tree like butter.  It held up very well, and for a lighter axe, it cuts firewood that is semi-split with ease. It's also excellent for making smaller kindling."
4.0,Good for chopping wood. Wish longe
5.0,I used this while camping and it was sharp and had great leverage. I could easily make firewood with this.
4.0,"This is a great camping axe. It is a good tool for clearing up felled trees. I am able to slice through 2"" diameter green branches with one stroke. I now leave the pruners behind in favor of this. The only con so far is the amount of vibration in the handle."
5.0,I love this axe because it is cast in one piece and I don't have to worry about the head coming off. Used it to chop a stump out of the ground and it worked great.
4.0,"Just what I needed. I'm 5'6"" and not in ideal shape muscle-wise. The axe was a comfortable weight and size for my frame. The edge was sharp. I used it to fell a 6-inch diameter tree that was growing horizontally due to canopy shading it from sunlight. I wore a pair of decent work gloves and felt no shock in my hands or forearms. In don't use chainsaws and this tree could not be cut down with a bow saw; this axe made light work of it.

I expect to use this more as a felling axe and not as a log-splitter."
5.0,"Great little axe, I stow it in the back of my SxS box. Don't have to worry about it running out of gas."
5.0,Perfect for camping.  It's lightweight and works better than your traditional heavy axe.  The estwing is extremely useful for throwing purposes also.
5.0,"MADE in the USA - Sharp - EXCELLENT Quality!  I HIGHLY recommend this.  I use this for cutting thick brush, weed like trees, black gums, oaks, other hardwoods and branches.  Practice a little before taking it into the field to understand the effectiveness and your swing.  A GREAT Gift for anyone who has more than a few acres."
5.0,"I have a ton of bamboo in my backyard and I've tried using everything from saws, chainsaws, and machetes to cut it down. Some tools took too much labor. The chainsaw kicked when the bamboo would start to fall. So I decided to splurge on this axe. It's fantastic. I can cut down 1-3"" shoots in just a few chops. And it's easy on my wrists and hands. Glad I bought this."
2.0,"It feels like it would be a pretty good axe. The One I got came with a semi sharp blade. The down side is that my handle is bent. It has a bow that spans from the head of the axe down to the top of the handle. Not sure if this axe will still split or chop but I'm pretty annoyed by this. Still debating on whether or not to ship it back because I have already had to ship back several products in the past two months and I'm damn sick and tired of having to pay return shipping because people don't want to ship out products that aren't damaged. This is getting really tedious.  I don't think it came like this from Estwing. Probably more along the lines of the warehouse, because the box it came in was not padded or robust enough to hold an axe. The box was literally falling apart and it was held closed with two pieces of scotch tape. If I could have bought this from a brick and mortar store for a little more I would have done so just so i could avoid this type of crap.
 EDIT: Returned and bought one from the Home depot for less. It works like it should."
5.0,A wonderful camp ax. A tool that will last decades.
2.0,This product broke down on the fourth or fifth use - some tubing inside came undone - it is still to be seen whether we can repair it and how much trouble that will be.
5.0,"This is a terrific sprayer for kitchen gardens or lawn maintenance.

The back straps are padded and adjustable for comfort, the spray wand is brass for durability, and the trigger swivels for comfortable spraying.  It comes with a strainer to prevent grass cuttings and other foreign objects getting into the tank when you fill it.

It can be adapted for right or left handed spraying comfort, and the tank is translucent, so you can see the level of the liquid inside.  It requires no tools to set up or clean, and can be used for spraying insecticides, weedicides or plant food.

The big advantage of the Hudson Suprema is that unlike other back pack sprayers, you don't have to keep pumping the handle while spraying.  A few pumps give you enough pressure to spray quite a large area before pumping again.

There are other benefits of this sprayer, such as the non kinking hose and the availability of a spare parts replacement kit.  One should also note the detailed instructions that come with it, and the ten year warranty period.

One of the best back pack sprayers on the market.

Amanda Richards"
5.0,Great for chopping smaller fire starter pieces of wood
1.0,"The axe has begun to chip on the primary edge after less than 100 swings involving soft wood and is showing signs of edge rolling in certain parts in addition to some rusting even though it has been kept dry and protected. No rock hits or nails... just plain soft-wood.
Not sure what grade steel it is but it is definitely not one suited for an axe of any caliber and does nor seem to be all that great of a quality of stainless either."
5.0,"My husband loves this. Very sturdy, does the job!"
2.0,"Estwing product developer 1: Hey look at this awesome axe i designed. Works great, looks great!
Estwing product development manager: Let's cover it in stickers that can't be removed also, make sure the barcode covers plenty of footage also! And be sure that anything that will remove the sticker, will mess up the finish!

Get the idea? The stickers are the kind that will not peel off, you will have to scrub them off or use harsh chemicals to remove them. All from an american company too. *sigh*"
5.0,"This is a perfect camp axe, you can use it up to small trees and is incredibly effective at clearing thumb sized brush."
4.0,"For what I need it for it will work.
My employee broke two ash handle axes trying to get out one stump, so I bought just so it would be bomb proof.
To light and too short a handle for doing something like splitting cord wood."
2.0,Lightweight which is good. Blade will chip in a heartbeat which is bad. Metal is of poor quality.
5.0,This is a great light weight axe and is easy to use.  The handle feels good.
5.0,I already had a chance to use it few times. It is quite light and for me was too... light. But this is not a product defect - I should buy bigger/heavier axe.
5.0,Wonderfully constructed axe.  Could have come a bit sharper but sharpening it is a breeze.
4.0,"Leaks at top joint- I suppose because pressure is so high. That being said- very usable, very well made."
5.0,The Chapin sprayer performed as stated. I am very happy with it. It is refreshing to find a quality product. I am happy with it and Amazons servicel
5.0,"great product, functions well! Recommended by a friend who loves his also. Nice to have a product that functions as promised."
5.0,"this sprayer works great! I hate to climb up on ladders and work plus fighting with them, this sprayer shoots higher than 30 feet! It sprayed my trees with fungicide better than I hoped, great product."
5.0,Perfect for my needs. I use a five gallon pail with a lid.  Cut a hole in the lid for the hose to drop into. Much easier to carry and manipulate than a tall hand pump sprayer Range is phenomenal.  It is a quality product as to materials and construction
5.0,Great product. I've tried more than one typical 2 gal sprayers. They just did not do the job spraying my fruit trees. I could not reach the upper branches.
5.0,"This was purchased for my dad as he prefers this over any other type sprayer.  He's had better luck this.  He wore his original out (used it for around 20 years).  I'm hoping it'll last that long, if not longer.  Best thing about it, easy clean up.  Just wash out the bucket, with hot soapy water (from the bucket) just spray, then follow using cold water. No clogging."
3.0,"Works up to 25ft, spraying. Also slight leak near handle when pumping. Did an OK job pumping liquid."
5.0,This was a birthday present and the recipient was very excited!
5.0,Good value. Well made. USA product
5.0,Such a solid product - Estwing is really the only mallet/axe company I trust.
4.0,"Full tang axe is cool. Many things I like about it, few I don't:

I hope every sticker engineer out there that makes their products' stickers hard to remove experiences all of the anguish their consumers feel. For real though, on this product (special edition - black paint) it was expecially bad because goo gone and acetone both removed paint (not down to the metal) from the product.

The little piece of tape around the joint midway up the handle (yellow on the standard color model) is a joke. Estwing, you gotta weld a bead around there or something. Don't cut corners on the finishing work with a piece of tape that will last a day. I mean I'm sure it's fine but it's not a budget tool - go big or go home.

Maybe this should be expected, but had to sharpen it up a bit beyond the factory job"
5.0,Lizzy Borden would be jealous.
2.0,Great product.....if they would send the correct length. Supposed to be 26 inch. This is 18 inches. Unless there is a some other fancy way to measure axes.
4.0,"Not quite as heavy or wide on the striking end as I would like.  More like the venerable estwing hatchet with an extended niche.  For people who want a little extra oomph but need to keep the weight down this will work, otherwise move along"
5.0,"Great design. Crazy sharp, I cut my thump taking off the protective cover the first time. Well balanced and good length for one or two hands (I am 5'8""). I wouldn't recommend it for splitting large firewood but for trimming and for chopping roots it is great."
5.0,"I have used every axe style working in Florida woods for 50 years and a man had one of these. I used it ten minutes and bought this with overnite delivery. I have axes over 100 years old, my favorites, but they have been retired. If this axe can't do the job, better go get a two man chainsaw or a Franklin Tree Farmer"
5.0,Good axe
2.0,Very disappointed!  I have used Estwing hammers for years...this product is not up to standard...edge of axe had a chip...not smoothly finished!  A small piece of yellow tape to cover the joint of handle and steel for axe...come on ESTWING!  Don't fail your loyal customers.
5.0,"Very solid built axe. Came with a good edge, and cuts well. Recommend for a quality axe for a good price"
5.0,Beast of an axe. This is a real tool. Light enough for back packing but it's all steel construction makes it a little heavy. Super tough and holds an edge well. Highly recommended.
5.0,"Took this axe on a camping trip a few days after I received it and it split cut, chopped and split wood with ease. I've wanted one of these for a long time and now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Love this axe!"
5.0,"I used this exact same axe for two years at a groundskeeping job, and knew, in my heart, that I'd found my weapon of choice for the zombie apocalypse.

Serious review - it's a good, solid axe, minimal vibration and shock to the hands, and the one I used at work, despite being beaten up, would still chop through 2-inch thick branches in a single blow.  Once while clearing a path, I hacked my way through a fallen 8-inch tree in under a minute.  I've recently gotten interested in camping and wilderness survival, so this was the first tool I bought.  I know it'll be dependable and long-lasting for building shelters and cutting firewood.

Non-serious review - only amateurs go for guns in a zombie apocalypse.  Gunfire draws the creatures.  Good ol' Blue here can take them down, one at a time, with a quick THOK or SKLCCH (depending on anatomical target choice).  And after what they did to your family, you want to kill them up close and personal, don't you?"
5.0,"Nice sturdy axe, has a comfortable feel while swinging and seems to have a well made construction"
5.0,Arrived falling out of the box but I won't ding the product any stars for that. This thing came sharp and works amazingly. I definitely recommend. No issues in performance or quality whatsoever.
5.0,I haven't used this axe extensively as of yet but appreciate the solid look and feel of the tool. It should fit my anticipated use nicely.
5.0,Loved it. Exactly as described
5.0,"Very nice.  Got one as a gift, too, and they loved it. Made in USA"
5.0,Best little axe ever. Love it. I broke a composite axe before I  ought this one. I put it through the paces and about 15 cord of wood with no issues and smooth one swing splits.
5.0,"Affordable, durable, light,  good for chopping, OK for splitting, great overall, get the job done, comes with a nylon sheath."
5.0,"Best axe my husband has ever owned.  Good for yard work and camping.  You're not going to cost down an oak but a small shrub or medium limbs, it is perfect.  Has a nice protective cover when not in use.  Quality stainless steel.  We've bought our last small axe!"
4.0,"Havent had to chop wood wiht it yet but sure came in handy to kill a snake in my driveway the other day.

Solid looking build. Feels well balanced in my hand. I will sure appreciate and need this for next winters wood pile.

Would work well for the Zombie apololypse also."
5.0,Outstanding product! Love the size of it - not quite full size so very versatile and able to get some swings in a tight area. Not too small for felling very large trees. Chopped away at a monster tree for an hour with my partner who had a full sized axe. My Estwing did more damage than his full size - mainly because of the axe but also because I'm an absloute beast! Very sharp and durrable. Very happy with the purchase! Highly recommended!
5.0,"This ax comes SUPER sharp - my first few whacks at some small overgrown saplings (4"") went straight through them and into the dirt. I didn't see that coming! This is one of my favorite new toys, er- tools in my arsenal. I'll have to try actually chopping and splitting wood soon and write another update."
5.0,"Lightweight and razor sharp, an excellent axe that is mid-way between a hatchet and a full felling axe, and useful enough to fill both roles. The fact that it comes with an effective sheath is definitely a huge plus, as it would cost ten dollars or so to buy a sheath otherwise. I'm very happy with this axe."
5.0,Good size
5.0,Very good axe light also am happy with it
4.0,"You know its funny if you look closely at the photo or youtube it you'll see a thin piece of sticky adhesive sticker around the arm, its to cover an indentation grove I'm thinking its what the makers machine uses to hold the arm while forming it. They could have done a better job then that bout it's ok for a hatchet but I was hoping for move stability when using it but that could be just me... seems well made so far.. Not meant for a guy with big hands like myself but again its well made, I'll use it every now and then"
4.0,"I bought this as a replacement spool for my electric ""Twist N Edge"" trimmer. The spool fits perfectly on the trimmer. This replacement  string performs the same as the original string. I did not rate this product 5 stars because I would like to have more string on the spool."
3.0,"This product seems to be intended for very light duty.  Fortunately that is my situation.  It does always run, however, the spool runs out fairly quickly.  I would not buy this product again."
5.0,"Tried to find this at all our stores and no luck, then I found it here.
Great service and speedy delivery, will shop here again."
5.0,I love this for camping so durable and effective.
5.0,Nice product
5.0,it just the right size.
5.0,Can't swing a full sized axe anymore - this is a fantastic substitute.  Especially useful when clearing snags out of our local stream - NO POLUTION
5.0,I still have and use the Estwing hatchet I've had 46 years. This axe is built with the same quality I expect to have this for years to come.
5.0,Sweet inexpensive axe
5.0,Exactly as described.
5.0,I love it. Got here fast. Thanks
2.0,"This axe arrivied with the edge all janky. It had metal burrs along the edge, as if they hadn't finished sharpening it.  There was also one small pit/notch in the edge as well.  The sides were unevenly ground, with one side having a much steeper angle (not sure the right axe vocabulary) down to the cutting edge.  And it wasn't really sharp, perhaps because of the burrs on the blade."
5.0,Nice solid ax.
4.0,It'll cut.
5.0,Really nice axe for camping.
5.0,THIS IS A AWSOME AXE = HEAVY DUTY
5.0,"This is great for taking along for camping trips, very sharp"
5.0,"Nice quality axe. Bought for my son. He likes it, so it must be ok."
4.0,"A+, Quickly shipped and product works great"
5.0,It comes slightly sharp but I touched it up before use and it works great.
5.0,"Great axe, cuts well.  I used it to chop down several smaller trees in my yard and it took them out quickly.  Well made product and superior to most of the axes I found in local stores."
3.0,"My only gripe concerns the paint. It's not durable at all. In fact, it looks and acts like a spray can version of a flat-black paint. Graphics are cheap stickers. Nothing worthy of the extra price. Now if you don't like blue, but dig the black handle, pay the extra bucks, just don't expect anything better."
5.0,really nice axe worth the money
5.0,It was just what I was looking for
5.0,"Great fit for old, discontinued WeedEater brand trimmer."
5.0,The Weed Eater spool was exactly what I needed.
5.0,Fit exactly like the other one that broke.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Works with my older weed wacker.
5.0,Fit the old trimmer I have.
1.0,wrong spool for my trimmer. that's the way it goes sometime.
5.0,Fits like a glove
4.0,On time and exactly what I wanted
4.0,Replacement for previous used item.
5.0,trimmer spool easy to install and works great  in corners and hard to get spots. Very pleased with the results.
5.0,Fit perfectly!
5.0,Good replacement part. Fits my weed eater perfectly. Had to get help to replace it
5.0,Works great in our weed eater weed wacker.
5.0,Good value.

5.0,Item shipped quickly and fit perfectly.
5.0,Great! Fits my trimmer perfectly. Would buy again!
5.0,Fit my weed eater.  Works great.  That's all I needed.
5.0,Absolutely worth every penny.
5.0,A1 As expected
5.0,Made in the USA great quality fast shipping much recommended
5.0,It's perfect! I'm sure he'll love it as a Christmas gift.
5.0,Simply the best one you can buy for this amount of money.  Don't waste your time on anything else.
5.0,Best thing I've ever had to swing
5.0,Always wanted one of these. Very pleased with the axe. My hammers are the same brand.
5.0,A good dude always needs a good axe. This is a good axe.
5.0,Needs to be heavier. It worked great for cabin tent poles
5.0,This product was just what I wanted and super fast shipping.
4.0,Surprised to find this spool. Was afraid it wasn't being made anymore. I'm happy !
2.0,"wrong one even thou I looked  @ my old pkg but unfortunately it didn't work, took some consistency but did get money back"
5.0,Great pricing and products.
5.0,"Repair Clinic and E-Replacement Parts have parts. E Replacement Parts has exploded views of equipment. Amazon has parts in bulk. Get Amazon's 12"" hemostat pliers or the 45 degree hemostat pliers to replace fuel lines and filters. Cut line at a slant to ease installation. Set the lo mixture for highest RPM's at idle and the hi mixture for highest RPM's at full-throttle. Set the idle until the spool just stops. Stens has a catalog for 2 and 4 cycle equipment. It is their FULL-LINE catalog. It is a VERY good catalog! Check Amazon for availability. Stens has diaphrams in bulk. It is diaphragm only instead of needing the kit. Check carb. make and model for correct kit. Stens has diaphrams for WT carbs. and others."
1.0,Didn't fit need to send back
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,WORKS GREAT !
4.0,Easy to order and worked great
3.0,Very thinn as compare to others...
4.0,I got the weed eater spool in good time and the packaging was good. I put it on my old trimmer and worked fine and was very happy. I would buy it again.
3.0,"I've only used it a few times so far but it seems well made and overall very good - as it should be considering the price.  However, the nozzle they give you is a fan spray and is not adjustable.  It seems like for the money they charge they could give you a decent nozzle.  To make matters worse Amazon recommends a nozzle that doesn't fit."
3.0,"The spray coming out of this sprayer is weak apparently due to clogging in spray tip.  Last time I used it, I unscrewed the tip and boiled it hoping to clean it out.  Hope it works.  If anyone has suggestions to improve sprayer function, please let me know."
4.0,The sprayer was same as a previous sprayer that I have had for 20 years and it has worked great.
2.0,"No pressure relief valve...are you kidding me? I used it once and will not use it again for safety reasons, all sprayers need relief valves to release the air pressure when you are finished and also as a safety feature to avoid a over pressurized accident. Go buy a Chaplin poly sprayer, cheaper and better. I want to like the metal tank but without a pressure relief valve, no thanks. Mine is sitting in my basement, what a waste of money, don't do the same, avoid this product like I should have."
1.0,"This is the first time buying a sprayer that was so expensive but after the last piece of junk, I decided to buy this one and see if it was any good. I'm happy to say that it is very good quality. It has a metal tip that can be cleaned when it gets clogged. I've only used it once so far but I can't imagine it falling apart for a long time. I would recommend it and would buy it again.
UPDATE........I have had this sprayer for just 3 years now and the paint on the inside is coming off and clogging the sprayer tip, I have to clean it every 3 or 4 minutes, what a PAIN.  I would NOT recommend buying this one EVER!!!"
5.0,"I use to have 1 just like that 1 years ago but it got old n wanted n needed another 1, looked a few places n couldn't find it n found it real easy on amazon."
5.0,"Easy to use, sturdy construction. Exactly what we need to spray large areas for weed control. Happy we purchased this product."
5.0,We went with this professional sprayer because the cheap plastic one was just not doing a good job. It was always getting clogged and did not spray a very wide area when it was working. This sprayer covers a much larger area and does not get clogged. My husband gets the yard work done in half the time. We do all of our own spraying for weeds and bugs and this was a lifesaver.
5.0,"I was a moron buying those cheap (even not so cheap) plastic sprayers from the local home improvement centers. This sprayer is Very well built, looks like it will last forever. No pressure release, just lay on side with the supply line on the high side. Squirts out all the air in about 20 sec, no prob.
One year update: You may want a different spray tip. The fan tip is probably great for spraying concrete curing emulsion but not so good for bug spray. Can't say which tip to get, haven't ordered one but will soon. No rust yet.
I'm careful not to bang it around so as not to compromise the paint/galvanized finish. Don't leave it full, the pump rod will rust, probably a standard good housekeeping practice anyway. The pump started leaking, not holding pressure.
Found out earwigs (what a stupid name for a bug) got into the air holes in the top of the pump and made a mess. The pump dis-assembles easily. The screw part at the top just pops off the whole bottom section. There were bits of bug carcass throughout, especially the valve at the bottom of the pump. Once re-assembled with some synthetic grease, worked like new. So just don't leave it laying around. Still love the unit, but godda get another tip."
5.0,"It took me a while to finally brake it out and use it but it was worth the wait. Wow, I've owned a lot of different sprayers in my time, most usually left me disappointed, but this sprayer is in a class of its own, I wish I would have done this along time ago. Its sturdy, the spray handle and nozzle are solid, and it holds 3 gallons which I like. I can't say enough about the all around construction of this unit. If you are thinking of purchasing this unit don't wait, buy it, you won't be disappointed! The last sprayer you will ever have to buy, I know it is for me."
5.0,This product arrived quickly and is exactly as described.
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,Exactly what I needed.
2.0,"Poor quality string, it breaks if a strong fart get's near it let alone solid objects such as grass."
5.0,It arrived.  It's a spool.  It has cutting string wrapped on it.  It fits a WeedEater.  (Please excuse the sarcasm.  Amazon thinks everything is the Mona Lisa)
5.0,Works well and I couldn't find it locally so glad to have it.
5.0,I bought two of these and they work perfectly in my weed eater. I'm always breaking that particular part and am glad I could replace it without replacing my weedeater.  Simple fix.
5.0,Just what I was looking for.
5.0,Everything fine.
5.0,Replacement head switches out easily with the old one.  Very satisfied.
5.0,"good string trimmer for my weed trimmer , unfortunately the trimmer broke, bought another one with same size, will buy again when needed"
5.0,Never can find in stores.  Infact I am about to order more.  Thank you
5.0,perfect
5.0,The real poduct!
5.0,Easy to change. Took less than 2 minutes.
5.0,fits perfect..price is good
5.0,good product
4.0,fit good
5.0,Just what I need to get the job done.
5.0,I got what I paid for- shipping was a bit expensive.
5.0,Great Estwing quality!
5.0,It's perfect.
5.0,"This is indeed a useful tool.  I have used it to clear privet (15'+) and small saplings (15-25'+) - over several acres and still going.  The tool arrives sharp and ready for action.  It is not a ""felling ax"" for trees (40'+).  The blade is narrow and has a deep bite meaning that it is not easy to disengage from the wood if swung too hard.  But, if used on smaller dia. trunks (2-6""), it is a ""hot knife through butter"" experience.  2"" trunks or limbs can be severed in one stroke.  It can be swung one-handed if you know how to control it and have the strength to do so, but always - always make sure of the downward path of the ax and NOT have your leg in the way.  This is a ""grown-up"" tool - no play toy!  A careless mistake can cripple or (if an artery is severed) kill you.  Not for children.  The ax is single forged and is extremely sturdy.  The handle length allows for two-handed use with proper back clearance.  I'm 5'9"", shorter arms... if taller and longer arms, two-handed use might be a little uncomfortable - but doable.  The rubber cushioned handle (lower portion) absorbs a lot of shock.  Like said, if you're experienced with using an ax, you'll love this one.  Best use - trunks up to 8"" dia., limbs, brush, small firewood jobs .... excellent camping tool.  As always, using the proper tool for the job is key.  Trunks > 8"" probably best dispatched with a chainsaw.  I look forward to many years with this ax.  Keep it oiled (no rust) - sheathed when not in use - stored safely - and Sharpen when needed.  Dull blades cause more accidental cuts than sharp ones.  (no incentives were offered or received for this review)"
5.0,"Great blazing axe and it holds an edge well. I think it has a more flexible handle than the ones made 3 years ago, but it does what it is supposed to."
3.0,"I bought this axe form Home Depot for $45 I wish I had returned it. When trying to use it to split logs for a camp fire this axe constantly got stuck in the log as the axe head is to thin by design. It penetrates really deep but it does not have a wide enough head to split the log. If you look on Youtube  there is a guy that did a very extensive review on this axe explaining this some thing in quite detail. I had a lot of hope for this axe as the fit and feel are great. Estwing is a solid company and they almost hit the mark with this axe if only they had widened the wedge. I recommend the Fiskars X15 Chopping Axe, 23.5-Inch over this one. I bought it to fill the roll that this one did not satisfy. I hope my review helps you in your purchase and thank you for reading it."
5.0,Best hand axe I ever used.  Great balance and just feels better than a wooden handled one.
5.0,Super high quality axe. My husband loves it.
5.0,This is a Keeper!!!
5.0,"It's a giant Estwing Axe........whats not to like? It's the perfect size for camping, or storing in your car. I hide mine in the Spare tire well of my trunk. This thing is sharp to- like knife sharp."
4.0,Very well built axe. Estwing is a well established company that builds quality products. I bought this axe to carry in my car for emergency use.
5.0,Fit like a glove.
5.0,Excellent product ...easy to install & works right off the bat!
5.0,Excellent. It did exactly what I needed it to do. No complaints.
5.0,The part fits and works perfectly.  I have had to order more and more small engine and yard tool parts online and Amazon has been a big help.
3.0,These spools are used up way too fast.  Consumed two at $10 each to do only three fourths of our small yard before we ran out of line.  $20 to $30 every time we edge - that's a lot.
5.0,The Weed Eater replacement is pool string is the exact product for my Weed Eater. I am very satisfied with the product.
5.0,"For some reason this trimmer spool is hard to find, even in a major metroplex. It's so much easier and more convenient to order on line and know I'm getting what I needed."
1.0,The weedeater keeps falling apart and it is impossible to keep the spool of string from tangling after just a few minutes of use.  I even purchased 2 extra prewrapped spools to see how it's done and both of them got tangled within minutes. Also the shield won't stay put.  I've given up on using the weedeater.
1.0,"This is a review of Weed Eater WEEL11 11-Inch 3.6 Amp Electric String Trimmer, not the string trimmer spool. It is too heavy, too short in the handle, parts don't click together correctly.  Keeps falling apart.  Takes about an hour to do a square inch of grass.  Cuts the grass unevenly.  Makes a noise like a 747 ready to take off.  A horrible product.  I was looking for a replacement for  my XT112 Weedeater which is a marvelous product.  What happened to this thing?"
5.0,"Great service. Didn't fix my problem (line won't feed - must be the motor itself), but that's my problem. Got what I paid for."
5.0,"We have an older weed eater (2-3 years old--sad to say I guess this is considered old what with all the cheap products out there) and we cannot find the cord anywhere.  If not for Amazon, we would have to buy another weed eater!"
5.0,"Just Fine. The exact replacement spool that is appropriate for my model of weed wacker. I'm so glad I found it on Amamzon. Hurray, for me!!!"
5.0,I have had and hated many elecric weed eaters over the years. This replacement spool is simple to use. I love it!
3.0,Actually this trimmer spool did not fit my Weed Eater RTE-115C.  I gave the spool to my daughter and haven't heard from her how it worked.
5.0,These replacement spools  can be  pricey.  This was a great value for 2. Who wants to try and master re-filling the old spools manually? Too much work for me ! Loved the price.
4.0,t can I say about this product?  It's weed eater cord.  It was what I expected it to be.  And it works fine.  I think the model of weed eater it fits is being discontinued and couldn't find it anywhere.  Bought extra so we'd have enough.
5.0,So glad to find this item on-line.  Much better bargain than I could ever get locally.  Great sales and service.
3.0,"It said it would fit my weed eater and it doesnt. Instead of returning it though and dealing with a restocking fee, i just took the cord off and transferred to the old spool."
1.0,"They send the wrong item, I had specifically gave them item #, they still send wrong item, I contected them and they wanted to charge me a 15% fee for re-stocking, when they send wrong item. I won't do buisnes with people like this, I don't recomend with shaddy people like this!!!!"
1.0,"i bought this same spool when i got my weed eater and it was easy to replace,i recently ordered another replacment spool of the same kind but this one dosnt fit!"
2.0,"The rain gauge as pictured is not exactly what i recieved. The one delivered was slightly different. It was a tapered tube, and the numbers were not painted. The taper is OK, but with the numbers being not painted, it is very difficult to read the rain volume. I am very disappointed."
1.0,I bought this to replace a similar raingauge.  When I received it I noticed that the numbers on the gauge are about 1/4 inch big and just stamped in the plastic.  No paint or anything to make them standout.  The gauge only sits about 6 feet from my house but I can't see how much rain we have had unless I go out (with my glasses on) and look at it.  My old one (similar in appearance) I could read from in the house.  This one is hard to read with my glasses on and holding it in my had. I would not this type again.
4.0,product lacked mounting screws  and numbers etc. were clear plastic had too dye them
4.0,This  rain guage is replacing a similar Taylor rain guage that I have had sitting out in the Arizona sun for 15 years that is well worn but still works accurately. It has outlasted several other guages including an electronic one and is just as  accurate. I was having a hard time finding this particular guage so I bought two.
4.0,"We had this rain gauge for about seven years and needed to replace it, the 'holder' had dried out in the hot FL sun and broken.  We finally found one on Amazon.  The only problem is the numbers are not colored so it was hard to read...but a black marker fixed this easily- so now it is really like our original.  We've had this gauge for years and really like it."
5.0,"Great accuracy for low price. Measures in 0.05"" increments. solid construction. Have had  previous one for over 10 years and still not cracked from weathering."
3.0,The first plastic tube cracked and leaked after a freeze.  The second one is working fine in warmer weather.  Watch out for ice accumulaation in the tube!!  GW
5.0,Husband loves this.
5.0,well built last forever great product
1.0,"for some reason amazon doesn't allow me to post a critical review about certain items. so again,  as i said in my original review...the axe had a rolled edge out of the box.  i fixed it myself no big deal. don't bother contacting estwing if you have this issue, they will do nothing about it. otherwise this axe seems ok. i have yet to test it in the woods."
5.0,Excellent piece of equipment
5.0,"Axe is pretty good for chopping stuff but I wish I had bought the longer model, this has now been vanquished to trunk of a police car to chop branches blocking roadways or breaching an entrance. If you want it for cutting wood, get the longer (36""?) model and thank me later. Five stars for doing what an axe should do and looking cool while swinging it."
4.0,Very sharp just not great on logs.
5.0,Very high quality axe!
5.0,"Razor sharp ,well built, good price, speedy delivery-5 stars"
5.0,Sharp axe and just the right size for putting in my RV.  Smaller hatchets just don't do the job sometimes and this is almost a full size which makes short work of most kindling making chores.  I've had several hammers from Estwing and they have all proven very durable - which I fully expect this axe will be too.
5.0,"Arrived on time and in good condition. It was very sharp when it arrived. I immediately took it into the woods and chopped a 6"" diameter dead tree in half. The blade kept it's edge and no sharpening was required. I plan to use in my bug out kit and for camping."
5.0,good product if you can find it  problem is two years after they sellthe trimmer know one carry the spools
5.0,"just what i needed so i ordered a few , easy to put on th espool and thye work well in cutting a trimming my yard hubby loves it saves money on the other"
5.0,"I bought this Featherlight trimmer years ago, refurbished, and It finally needed a new bump spool. this one is slightly different in design but is obviously the correct replacement and it works well, hopefully I will get 9 years out of this one too!"
5.0,This was the correct trim line for my string trimmer. It worked as it was supposed to. I bought it here because it was the cheapest price I could find.
5.0,Just your basic refill for the weed-eater - the local store didn't have it so was glad to find it on Amazon.  It does what it's supposed to do!
5.0,"Good brand, as described."
2.0,I don't know what I was thinking.  If your reel is good just buy the refill string and rewind.  It's a good product and can be useful if you keep it refilled for a quick change.
5.0,I was pleased with the fast service - no more excuses for putting off that 'weed eating' project!
5.0,"As a senior citizen, I want a product that is light weight and easy to use.  This Weed Eater fits the bill perfectly.  I would not hesitate to advise others to buy it."
4.0,"Basic weedwacker string.  Does what it does, doesn't skimp on the amount of string, and doesn't jam more than a couple times a roll.  Not a five because to be a five it would have to have even more string, but that's about it."
2.0,"The numbers are not black as shown, they are clear so you can't read it. We tried using a black marker on numbers but that didn't work out so well. Super disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it."
4.0,"simple and it works, had to highlight  the numbers they are rather hard to read."
4.0,It would be better if they had paint the measure numbers black.  The last on I bought of this model were painted black and much easier to read.
4.0,THANKS - received quickly and it was exactly as described and expected
1.0,"We bought this to replace an older Taylor rain gauge that is very similar in size, shape, and capacity to this one, but is getting a little hard to read as the numbers and markings are starting to weather, though it's still fully functional.  We have both the old one and the new one up a couple of feet apart, both far from any taller objects or splash sources, and they consistently measure different rain amounts.  The new one always reads about 10% less.  This is a bit confusing.  Are they both wrong, or only one?  And which one?  It's not rocket science to make an accurate rain gauge.  Maybe Taylor Precision Products needs to change its name."
5.0,"Wonderful, clear, sturdy.  Have used a Taylor Rain Gauge for years -"
3.0,"It is what they advertise with the exception that in the picture it looks like the graduation marks  are hi-lighted & they ARE NOT, so you can't read it unless looked at closely. Can't figure out why they did not do this."
1.0,This is a really great rain guage as long as it's not exposed to the weather.  It is made of a plastic that does not stand up to the elements!
5.0,Just what I wanted
5.0,works great
5.0,Does what it is supposed too.
5.0,fast shipping / great quality
4.0,This is my fourth Taylor gauge as they tend to fog  up after several years.  This one had clear measures instead of usual black.  I marked the inch measures with permanent marker.
5.0,Has easy to read increments and seems pretty accurate.
4.0,Plastic mount has a very short life.
2.0,Great rain gauge if they only would put some color on the markings. They are clear when it shows up and it is very hard to see what the value is because of that.
3.0,"I have owned several of these rain gauges over the years; the first lasted over 15 years before it was accidently shot, the second was twelve years before I moved and forgot to bring it.

I was surprised when I open my new one and noticed how the quality of construction had slipped; much lighter weight material, and the metering gauge is now just clear molded in plastic, and very hard to reed, previously it had been black and much easier to read.

I also noticed that there was a warning on the new one not to use it in freezing temperatures. I cant say if that warning was with the old ones or not, but I can say that they went through thousands of freeze/thaw cycles without a problem. If the new one is up to that I won't know until fall arrives, but if it isn't its useless other than perhaps southern California or Florida."
2.0,"Photo is of OLD well made USA unit NOT now sold China one

I farm and usually had 5 or more out in SW Kansas for years. When they were made in USA of the butal and units were marked black they were excellent and lasted years. Now they are junk made in China leak not durable plastic, no colored marks just another US company that sold out to China with no Quality control Chinese made junk. Ordered 4 2 years ago and all are damaged and bad now. For a gauge this expensive ought to not have these problems!!!

WAS excellent accurate NOAA certified .05"" rain gauge."
1.0,"the unit came without any paint on the numbers, near impossible to read.  I've had one of these for years with the numbers painted so I contacted Taylor.  They agreed the numbers and graduations should be painted so they sent a replacement.  After several weeks it arrived but was the same as the first.  I again contacted Taylor.  This time they requested pictures.  Again they agreed the scale should be painted and again they sent a replacement.  It arrived same as the others, totally clear.  I gave up!  Sounds like Taylor has a real QA problem."
1.0,"We received this rain gauge in April, 2014, and now, less than a year later, it has cracked all the way down one side.  This should not happen to something designed to be left outside year round."
4.0,Good solid product
4.0,If your buying this for light use while camping and minor wood chopping it works great! If you need an axe for splitting wood on a frequent basis then by a heavier axe or a maul. The head of the axe is thin and generally not to heavy. Exact opposite in what you want in a axe. But its portable! Mines 5 years old with no issues.
5.0,"Best camping axe ever. No bells, no whistles, just an axe (and hammer). My best friend has had one for years and I finally bought one too. Straps to both my small hiking bag and large camping backpack."
5.0,Great Axe for both the campsite and the backyard.
5.0,Estwing has been around for a long time - I bought my 1st estwing tools about 25 years ago and it is wonderful to see that their quality has not changed
5.0,Nothing beats Estwing quality and Amazon had the best price by 30% over buying at a local big box store.
5.0,Solid product.  I bought this based on a review of top wood axes on YouTube and didn't disappoint.  This axe's performance surpassed an ax which costed over $100.  Excellent product.  Keep up the great work!
5.0,I received this axe as a wedding shower gift. It's light weight enough for a lady to use and very sharp. It also cut our wedding cake remarkably cleanly.
5.0,Got it today and have had a hard time putting it down.  Now all I can think about is going camping to use this prize.
3.0,"This Axe is raved about in the community of Ave users. It's American made, I handled plenty of other estwing tools this one just isn't up to par. Don't get me wrong it's still very usable. But when I got mine out of the box it's handle had tons of loose rubber that was just undesirable to look at so I sanded it down to fix that problem. The edge was chipped rolled and down right garbage so I reprofiled it, and it had a yellow sticker to cover the seam on the neck of the axe that looks bad and doesn't stay on as well. So I took it off and filed down the seam to have finally made this a useable piece of art. But I came across one more problem and I can't fix it, the steel they use is way too soft to be used on an axe. The second i used it the edge chipped and rolled, and the only way I could fix it is to make the edges convexed. It is still usable it just needs a lot of work."
5.0,"Love it.
Could have been packaged better. It has brown doo doo on the handle."
5.0,The husband loved it!!
5.0,"Very nice sturdy camping axe, sharp and solid.  A must for any camper!"
5.0,"Recently discovered the need for a good camping axe to split firewood. This boy's axe was easy to use. It had a sharp bit when delivered, enough to get through the weekend. Sharpened up afterward with a Lansky puck. Hardwoods split easily. Primarily used by swinging wood and axe together against the block. Head is thin, so you have to strike a few more times than with a standard axe or maul to get the wood to separate. Weight, small size, comfortable grip more than made up for a few extra swings. Very portable, would not add too much extra weight to your pack if hiking. Also, I like that the head and neck are a single piece of steel. Used with a loop of paracord to pull tent stakes, just the right length to get a good angle. I would have bought the black model, but couldn't justify an extra $20+ for the paint job. Old Blue will do."
5.0,Love it nice sheath
5.0,Bought it for my son in law.  He loves it.  Sturdy as are most Estwing products. Great product.
5.0,"This is an excellent camping axe as it is well balanced and the perfect weight for the campsite. I mostly use it to chop wood for the bonfire while tent camping. I would not want to carry it on a back country camping expedition that already involves heavy packs; at that point I would make due with a hatchet. Mine came with a pretty good edge on it to begin with, no sharpening needed until after multiple uses. It looks even better in person with the blacked out handle and head. The finish starts to rub off the blade as you continue to use it, but the scuffed look just shows you've been using it like a man. Made in America is just another plus. Buy it!"
5.0,"Best axe for its size.  Great for splitting, cleaning up,  Does come w/ a nylon sheath, but can order separate leather one.

I use it for splitting kindling for my chiminea or limited splitting of larger logs.  If I had a ton of firewood, i'd want something longer.  But, the metal  construction is top notch.

Would be great for limited mobility folks.  I often split while seated on a bucket, and no problem.  Not a wide head, so does get stuck in and have to drop split from time to time."
5.0,"Awesome splitting ax. Great for camping and household tasks. I've chopped firewood, cut off branches , and completely demolished my neighbor's bathroom."
2.0,"The axe itself is perfect! The reason for my two star rating is that the description states that the axe comes with an ""Embossed leather sheath for safe storage."" It is actually sold with the nylon sheath. One of the reasons I selected this product was because of the leather sheath. I would be thrilled if someone would send me the sheath without having to return the entire product. If you are not picky about the sheath, this is a great product."
4.0,"I bought the Taylor rain gauge in April 210. I did have a problem with it leaking , so I took a dowel and popped the bottom out and applied clear silicone around the bottom of the tube and reinserted the cap and it has been fine for 5 years. I do like the accuracy of the gauge and the extra length gives it 2 inches for each 1inch of rain so you can read it easier. I tried the black marker on the numbers and It really help to see the numbers. I made my own bracket that mounts just above my house gutter and I can read it from the front porch. They do get  yellowish after a few years but I am happy with mine."
2.0,The product sent to me was made of a different plastic than described at the website. I am concerned that it will not stand up to weather as well as butylate.
2.0,"The picture of this is deceiving. The marks on the gauge are not painted and nearly invisible, even when held up to the light. The old design was dramatically better with black markings. The markings are raised so I may try to paint them this winter when I take it in."
5.0,Nice rain gauge.
4.0,seems to work fine but it is NOT glass as stated in the description but plastic and the plastic mount seems very flimsy.
5.0,"Just what I wanted. Simple, easy to install and  does the  trick. Easy to read  - very happy with it."
4.0,"I would have rated the rain gauge  a 5  but the measuring marks are impossible to read. I resolved this by coating the measurements with a permanent black ink felt tip marker,works beautifully now. I hope the gauge is indestructible and last as long time since I farm and use the rain gauge for making soil moisture decisions."
1.0,"The bottom dropped out after 1 month of use.
Also, the numbers are not painted black as shown in the photo - very hard to read."
1.0,"The photo shows black stenciling, however, the numbers are clear and unreadable.  I should have read the previous reviews.  item will be returned"
2.0,The picture is very misleading.  I (and you) will get impression that the gauge has black marking for the graduations.  Ths is NOT so.  It is lear transucent plastic and so cannot read how much is in the gauge.  Called the factory and they said that it is clear with no marking.  Factory web sit shows blacking marking on gauge also.
5.0,Very pleased with rain guage. Does a very good job accurately measuring rainfall. Comes with holder making it easy to mount.
4.0,It is very accurate.  I use it as a backup to my Davis weather station and it always agrees exactly with the station.  I do agree with the other reviews in that old models had black painted graduations/numbers.  No doubt some stupid decision made by an executive who's bonus depended on taking a few cents out of the cost.  Purchased mine locally from a farm supply store on sale for $1.99.
2.0,The numbers are transparent and hard to read compared to the 20 year old one it replaced.  The picture is copied from Taylor that used to be a quality instrument company and now it looks like they are brokering their name.  It has to be a added process and no doubt adds to the production cost.
4.0,"Heavy duty construction, easy to mount and easy to read.
Very accurate and easy to read, down to a 100th of inch."
2.0,"This rain gauge is not as shown in the photo.  The measurements are not in ""black"", so difficult to read."
3.0,"As many others have said, this gauge is hard to read. I will be replacing this with the stratus RG-202."
3.0,This appears to be an identical replacement of the rain gauge that was here when we  bought our home in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The only negative is that it's pretty hard to read -- there's no paint or dye on the numbers to make them visible. .
3.0,"As others have said, since the gauge is clear plastic with no contrasting color for the degree markings, it's a chore to read it at best, and nearly impossible with a flashlight in the dark. Otherwise, it measures rain. A version that I had for 10 years (until it cracked during a freeze) had black markings. Perhaps the manufacturer saved a penny's worth of pigment at the cost of several dollars worth of utility."
5.0,Bought to replace the same one that had been in use for many years. I expect this one to provide rain measurements for another 20 years.
3.0,I gave this to my husband - he said it is hard to read.  But it seems okay to me
5.0,Okay
3.0,"Disappointed that it came with two nicks on the blade. Also, not very sharp, but probably able to get a good edge with a $12 sharpener. At the corners of the blade, it is a bit rounded. On the sides of the blades, there were pits, and at the end of the handle there were brown or rust stains. As for chopping, I'll come back to that when I use it.  Just holding it, I feel the head might be a little too light."
5.0,"I bought this for my husband for our ""dust off"" bags and for use when we go camping. The length and design of the handle and ax are excellent for a good firm grip. My husband loves it!"
5.0,"ok, to be honest, I JUST received the axe...  however, I can tell, just by holding it, with one hand, its perfect for getting the job done.  Sheath is durable looking.  However, I wish the logo of the eagle was more than just a sticker as well as the Estwing logo also..  since those are just aesthetics the unit is one piece, not off balance.  I am 6'4"" 280ish lbs..  This will have a great swing and impact without hurting your back or hands.  This will be used on Cub/Boy Scout camping trips"
5.0,My father has had the standard version of this axe for 32 years and he still takes it camping to this day. I have owned other axes over the years and none have worked as well as this one is designed to for the money. As long as it is maintained I know I will not be let down.
2.0,"When I was a kid my dad had an Estwing hammer that he still uses to this day (must be 30 years old) this axe is not the same Estwing. It says it is made from ONE piece of steel but the shaft is hollow from the middle down and has a piece of tape crudely placed over the seam that was peeling instantly. I can tell its hollow for obvious reasons but it also has some material left inside of it that rattles like a rain stick when turned up and down.
I wanted black so it would match my jeep where it will stay and I never expected the black to stay on it and I don't care BUT there were so many stupid stickers all over it about how many pairs of safety glasses to wear and how much cancer the axe causes in California that when I finally got done scrubbing the sticky residue off with goo gone that it stripped the black off of it in those areas. Again don't really care about the black because it's an axe not a car but why on Earth would you put stickers on it like that?
There are poor edges and craftsmanship all over it and the patented handle is not cleanly in place like my dads hammer.

As far as how well it works, like a champ! Cut a medium sized tree down in my yard with relative ease. I just worry that with the hollow shaft it may fail while I'm in the woods in the Jeep cutting down planks or firewood when I need it most. It is light and swings well and to be fair it may be too heavy if it was solid steel all the way down.

Overall I would say it's worth the money it's just not the Estwing you may be used to. I expected better quality, this looks like it was made in Pakistan."
5.0,very sharp and very good quality.
1.0,Doesn't split wood easily.  Needs to be heavier
5.0,"I was surprised by the flex of the metal Handel.
Blade is sharp the length and weight are amazing for the bush"
5.0,"Great item to take camping, etc."
2.0,We have several soaker hoses and this one has inordinately large holes in it whereby it looks like a fountain when you are using it rather than a gradually dripping soaker hose.
4.0,"Hose works well in our two front flower beds.  Can already tell difference using the soaker hoses verses a regular sprinkler like we have been doing.  Plants look healthier and no more mushrooms from uneven watering and puddle build up w/ sprinkler.

Only con (not a biggie), was hard to weave hose around plants upon receiving due to hose wanting to maintain its curled shape.  Laid out in a straight line on side of my house for a few days and took care of the problem.

Happy with them and planning on getting 2 more for beds in the backyard.

(Side Note: Based on numerous articles it is not recommended to not use more than 100ft. of continuous soaker hose.)"
5.0,These soil soaker hose really save you time since you do not have to stand and hold a hose.  Just turn them on and forget them for a while.  They do not water to much in spots and not enough in other areas.  A real good investment for your garden.
4.0,"Liked this hose as it does not spray water through holes like most other hoses. No spray even with water faucet fully on, just slow sweating to wet the ground. Just got it, so have given in 4 stars since longevity is unknown."
4.0,"I bought this to keep in my camping trailer. The axe was very sharp when it arrived and splits small firewood with ease. The size of this axe is between a hand axe and a full-sized axe. It is well made and includes a sheath for the head. I was not careful the first time I removed the sheath and cut my hand on the blade. Again, it was very sharp when it arrived."
4.0,"I recently bought my first home. The previous owner grew grapes in the yard and the vines needed to be removed because they were encroaching on the fence and spreading to the neighbor's property and needed to be removed. I purchased this axe for this purpose. Many of the vines were older than 10 years and thicker than one inch and this axe made short work of them often with one stroke. I would not recommend this axe for felling trees or splitting larger logs, but it is very handy for smaller limbs and brush. The taper on the blade is very narrow, so it is easy to damage the cutting edge. I put a notch in the edge with missed strokes almost every time I use it. But, it sharpens easily with a file. The weight makes it easy to use and carry, but you will need to maintain the cutting edge. I sharped mine after almost every use. For the price, it is a very good tool. I also own an estwing hammer, which I love, and am happy with the brand overall. But, do not expect this axe to do everything. Light and moderate work is where it shines."
5.0,Neast this puppy has defyed odds and workes as a splittin axe
5.0,"I have owned my a 26"" campers axe for years. It has been on numerous camping trips and felled many trees. The edge is nicked up and it looks loved but still my favorite tool in the bush. I would strongly recommend adding one to your gear list."
4.0,"This is ok for splitting, kindling, and best for cutting some branches  off a tree. It is heavy for an axe but super strong. I like to try and break axes and hammers and I could not with this axe.  Only down fall is if you hit hard it gets really stuck and takes a lot to get it out."
5.0,"I keep an axe and a shovel in all of my offroad vehicles. The first one of these I have had for over 35 years and it is still being carried daily. I now have over half a dozen. The price of the Estwing allows me to do this painlessly.  The quality is more than adequate for occasional use they receive. They require verry little care other than an occasional wipe down with some grease and some touch up sharpening. It isn't my first choice for everyday use, but it doesn't cost over $250 either. They have never failed to do whatever task was asked of them. If you are looking for a dependable decent quality product that you will carry more than you will use this is a great choice."
4.0,"Hard to beat Estwing products, I used an Estwing 32 oz framing hammer for years without a problem. I look forward to using this fine camp axe and will continue to use Estwing products."
5.0,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Of course he picked it out. He was very impressed with it plus it had a good price!
5.0,What a great axe! Such a nice satisfying swing.
5.0,"Great axe, wrapped proximal exposed steel with paracord and sharpened for action.  Came fast quality product!"
5.0,"Great little axe. Very sharp, nice things blade so it just cuts with easy. Very easy to handle. Definitely want to get a little bigger one for some bigger jobs. But this is a great light axe for clearing and camping. Would strongly recommend it."
5.0,They make the best stuff! Period
5.0,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5.0,I have owned many estwing Tools in my life and they are the some of the highest quality tools made... I have seen and held one of these and I believe it's probably a very nice tool to use and I will be using it very soon in Oregon
4.0,Boyfriend liked this to chop wood into smaller wedges for fireplace. Still using it and no problems!
2.0,The axe doesn't look authentic.
5.0,Awesome buy...bought this as a present. Have a similar one that 20+years old. Still an OUTSTANDING axe!
5.0,"If you want the best tools money can buy, always choose Estwing. Thanks"

4.0,great axe. feels good in your hand. and looks good on my truck.
4.0,Factory edge needs work but its a great tool
5.0,Love it!!
4.0,"Description says comes with embossed leather sheath it does not It comes with a blue cordura nylon sheath
The same axe and sheath can be bought at Home Depot for a couple $ less
Estwing E45A campers axe is the perfect camp and backpacking axe
Great for chopping and light splitting ( kindling )
Comes with a good edge right out of the box
Can be used one or two handed"
5.0,great
2.0,"The stakes are cut from low grade lumber with many knots. The wood is so green that the stakes were warped even though bundled tightly. The angle of the ""sharpened end"" is too great (22.5%) instead of a sharp (15%). These conditions make the stqkes unusable for form work as they cannot be driven into even mildly hard ground.

At the cost of $1.00+ a stake (plus shipping) I can purchase an 8' 2x8 and make them on my own for less money, and less time."

Have to love Amazon's easy return policy but I'd still like the axe with a leather sheath as described."
5.0,very well made when i got it in it had a good edge on it i whent to use it an i cut 3 trees about 6 inches through the center i done this in about 5 mins for all three trees
5.0,"Bought this for my Dad for the holidays and it works wonders for him! With his arthritis and older age, he likes how smooth, sharp, and easy this axe is for him to use on our (former) palm trees and old furniture."
5.0,The axe is exactly what I wanted. The delivery and service was good.
5.0,Everything I was hoping for. Very strong and holds its blade sharpness. Been using around farm to wack small saplings with ease and will use for camping
4.0,estwing...good stuff..
5.0,"This is not a splitting axe, it is a chopping axe. It *excels* at chopping. If you try to split with it, it will be damaged and you will be disappointed."

5.0,perfect size for the job

5.0,thx
5.0,"Very good made, easy to use."
5.0,Best campers axe on the market
5.0,This axe is quite the suprise. For the size head it takes massive chunks out of some serious logs. I dulled out the manufacturer's sharpen to use my own wetstone and it holds an edge long. This item shouldn't be going anywhere in the next decade.(with proper maintenance of course)
5.0,great. Sleek. Was perfect for clearing dense privet hedge around pond in tight spaces.
4.0,"If only they made one a little longer and for splitting...  otherwise, this axe is awesome!"
5.0,good American made tool
4.0,Do not hack to much Elm it will warp handle
5.0,Great ax carry backpacking and hunting.
5.0,"Ridiculous that I should order accessories like this from Amazon. I suppose it is just a testament to how bad the Home Depot in North Miami truly is, that rather than cycling 2.5 miles and buying them spot, it is less irritating to buy them online. Rain Bird are our go-to brand of sprinklers. None of them are weed-whacker proof, but barring mechanical damage they work very reliably"
5.0,"This item is pretty easy to install and use. I had an existing sprinkler system, but one sprinkler head had frozen. The service company charges $75 to replace it, i got it done fro less than $10.

No tools were required and making it hand tight was enough to avoid any leaks. All i used was a thin flat head screwdriver to adjust the spray direction. I did get wet during the installation. It was a hassle to keep turing the system on and off to make the adjustments, so i just made them while the system was running.

Dont be afraid to try this one yourself!"
4.0,"Easy to install. Half the price compared to my local Hardware store. Easy to adjust. Keeps my driveway flowers properly watered. No drips. Fully shuts off when the tier turns off. I have had them for one full summer so far and so far, so good."

5.0,"For the last few years I've used a cheap(dull) axe while camping - this often lead to frustration, which is very contradictory to the camping experience.  I recently decided to ""splurge"" and buy this axe.  After a weekend at Pedernales State Park, I can say this axe eliminated the frustrations!  It was sharp and well balanced!"

5.0,quality tool
5.0,CHOPPED DOWN A TREE>>>>>
5.0,Smaller than I expected but man this will chew through a log.  I would buy this again in a hearbeat.
5.0,1 word  Estwing!!  don't need to say nothing else
5.0,"Great light duty camp axe, very sharp and seems to hold an edge well."
5.0,Best buy hatchet quality that only Estwing brings to the table
4.0,Great for limbing but not a great splitter.
4.0,"Bare with, i type a lot:

First off, lets get a few things out of the way.  Many times, you'll read an amazon review where the confirmation bias (I BOUGHT THIS so it HAS TO BE GREAT CAUSE I'M F'ING GREAT) is out of control.  One has TO HATE THAT NONSENSE.

That being said, I do a LOT of homework b4 i buy shittt. So yes, there's some major confirmation bias here, but i can also back it up with my experience, and right off the bat, i would buy this again if i lost it, or bent it.  I bought this to camp with, carry, pack, and bust up kindling, the extra work it's capable of is a bonus!
IF YOU are looking for an axe that will split a redwood, look elsewhere.  I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned in the many reviews of their axe ( i bought my Estwing E45A Campers Axe on 3/30/15 and waited until i had used it for a few months. So i wanted some real world experience b4 i posted a ""this is great because i'm great and i make no crappy purchases in my life"" review).  While there may be better USA made, for the money, this axe is light, sturdy, useful and vicious.  Sharpen your axe, and use it.  It's that simple.  Skip to the last sentences if you hate to read i guess.

Pros:
-It will split kindling and larger diameter logs (about 20-24"" wide) but you gotta know wtf you are doing - check (trim axing seems to be a lost art form)
-Double duty as a hammer - check
-Zombie apocalypse weapon or defensive weapon (not likely, but just in case) - check
-One handed wielding capabilities in a pinch - check (but i'm a larger fella 6'3 250+, but my lil camping buddy friend liked it for this reason too)
-The steel takes a nice edge with a regular bastard file and was easy to sharpen in a few minutes - check
-Love the sheath (though i wish it were blaze orange for backcountry visibility purposes) - check
-Made in USA - check
-Looks impressive strapped to my pack (for some reason, i love the Blue color!) - check

Cons:
-Can't do super heavy work, but can do small bites out of bigger logs.
-Shock - there's  SOME hand shock, but i have blue collar hands and don't really care as i'm used to some hard work and some arthritic issues. That being said, my wife might hate using this as opposed to a smaller axe with a more cushioned grip.  My son chopped away at some kindling too, and reported minimal issues with hand shock when I asked him.  My camping buddy loved it as much as I loved his Double bit axe from harbor freight and said he wanted his own after using mine on and off for 4 days on our trip.
-I think the grip is actually slightly small for my hands, but perfect for medium/large sized hands (this is a personal issue i didn't love).  Again, both my son and my camping buddy aren't my size and both said it was perfect for for them (and neither had any issues wielding it one handed either).
-I haven't had to use the warranty or contact them, so i guess that's a pro too, but i've read they aren't too great.  YMMV

That's about it.  Again,  I've also used  around the house, camping, and to clear some branches from my shooting lanes for whitetail archery (stationary treestand).  Yes, I'm embarassed to admit it, I'm not much of a thrower of tools/weapons, but we DID try throwing it a few times too, and it's actually balanced well enough to throw better than others ive tried.  An Estwing tomahawk is probably in my future for lighter missions and throwing practice.
All in all, it's a great light/medium duty axe that CAN do some heavier work if you know what you're doing.  Mine has suffered no bending or handle slippage, and i've put it through what i'd consider the paces i'd put any other tool through in it's normal first year usage so far.
I think this axe is a winner from Estwing and wouldn't hesitate to buy another for 30$ shipped for what i use it for as a spare/back up or if i lost or damaged this.  Highly recommended, and I look forward to taking it with on backcountry/hunting trips, and knowing I have a proven item that my hands have put through the paces (i tend to be tough on gear).

--The pic with the 2 axes in the log was a one handed one swing by me (estwing on the right) and my buddy double handed his 2 bit axe.  The
Estwing E45A can also bite deep on hard swings into larger bore logs,  but with a slimmer profile, it's harder to get back out, so beware there.  Commonly, people make that mistake trying to ""over"" split a log.  I'd say this axe actually excels at chipping away at bigger logs much better than it does splitting through and through if you know what i mean.
--The wood we cut with the chainsaw off the large logs, then split firewood equally with no issue using both the estwing and the double bit.  It would have been much more work obviously to just chop with the Estwing E45A, and the chainsaw kinda made for redundancy, but chopping wood is always fun too, so we opted for all 3 tools, and were both glad we did.  Past years we had a small coleman camping axe from walmart or target, and a cheapo bahco type hand saw, with pre split wood and both trips, we ran out of wood and were over working /underprepared with those dinky tyco toys...taking both axes and a chainsaw was worth taking less wood and putting a few extra hours time on the beginning of the trip.  If i were to have just the Estwing E45A on a back country hunt, i'd be fine now, knowing it's and my own capabilities regarding firewood.

If you don't like to read, and want to skip to the end, this is for you:

The win for the estwing is the portability into a backcountry hunt, but the double bit axe won hands down for sheer power (duH!), but lost for portability.
We did a boat on the pictured  trip, so it was a no brainer to take both.  Again, If i were to have just the Estwing E45A on a back country hunt, i'd be fine now, knowing it's and my own capabilities regarding firewood.  The pros of the Estwing E45A for me outweigh the cons.  Again, for 30$ shipped, i've spent more for worse tools.  I'm glad i did my homework and bought this after obsessing for months over which portable camping axe to buy.

Good luck with yours if you buy one and don't over work it.. Take smaller bites and don't abuse your tools, and keep it sharp!

Happy Camping!"
5.0,Great Sprinklers and the price was great too!
5.0,Great Sprinklers and the price was great too!
2.0,"I equipped my entire, three-zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers. They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.

Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals."

2.0,These break very easily because of the cap design.  Better to spend a couple of bucks more on the RainBird Pro Pop up.
2.0,"The picture looks good, but the functionality if far from it.  I was looking for Toro, settled for Rain Bird, MISTAKE!!"
1.0,"I hate these! Cheap garbage, leak and break too easily.

I install and repair sprinkler systems and these are always leaking too much around the pop up shaft and are often broken. You'll know the cheap sprinkler heads easily by the white slots around the outside edge of the top of the heads (see picture). For a tiny bit more money the Rainbird 1800 Professional heads are 20 times better."
5.0,Great product for the price.  Delivered on time and exactly as described in the post.  This works great for what I needed. . .
3.0,It's OK but need more pressure ...around 3 to 4 bars .Not so good seal ...thinking that the leakage is water around the garden ..For this price....it's OK
3.0,"Nice axe but if you are old like me it's not the solid steel handle we remember from our younger days, a few mixed licks and it may come to a bad end but so far so good, a good camp axe for light work"
5.0,I was very pleased.
5.0,"I BELIVE THIS IS THE PERFECT CAMP AXE. HOLDS A GOOD EDGE, JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH FOR MOST CUTTING AROUND THE CAMPFIRE OR AROUND THE HOME."
5.0,Fantastic lightweight tool that out of the box comes ready to take on the task. I used it to chop firewood and nail tent stakes into rocky ground. Very balanced and easy to handle!!
5.0,Very happy with purchase.
5.0,"Excellent axe. Very well made and it works great for chopping soft or hard woods.  Keeps a good edge when sharpened.
It's made in America with quality steel and if taken care of it should last a lifetime.  I don't leave my axe outdoors exposed to the environment when i'm not using it.  Mine came with a really nice leather sheath as well."
5.0,"very good axe, I love it and price was nice"
5.0,strong
5.0,Love mine.
5.0,"Great Axe for the money! Is it a ""Gransfors"" grade of Axe? Well obviously not? But does it chop wood? And can it chop a 10"" tree down? Yes it can. It may take a little more effort and almost twice as many swings as a high end Axe. But this thing can chop a tree down if need be. It doesn't come with a very Sharpe edge on it. It's not dull by no means but not as Sharpe as it could be. So I recommend you take it to a professional like I did and have nice edge put on it for 4 bucks! It will chop at least 20 percent better believe me. Also don't expect it to hold an edge as long as the higher end carbon steel axes. While high end axes don't need sharpening sometime's after chopping several trees? This one will require sharpening much sooner. I just carry a two sided stone with me if I take it camping just I case. But to be honest it stays plenty Sharpe for the amount of chopping I do. It's a bit heavy for backpacking with it on a hike but is manageable. I mainly chop smaller trees with it that are usually no bigger than 5 inches. And it works great for chopping up kindling wood..etc. I only went after a 10"" tree with it once to see how long it would take with this axe. And I must say it didn't do to bad. However I would normally use my high end ""Gransfors Bruks "" felling axe normally for big trees. :) So if your on the fence about buying this axe don't hesitiate! It will take care of anything you need chopped up at your camp site and also help drive those tent stakes into the ground with ease! Just remember the sharper you can make the edge the better the axe will be. I had read only a couple blogs about people actually breaking the steel shaft on this axe. One was using it in the artic I believe in Temps well below minus 30 degrees. Steel gets brittle at those Temps so I'm not surprised it shattered. The other one I read sounded like the guy was purposely trying to break the thing? And eventually he did. But it was from purposely beating it severely on the shaft just below the cutting head against a hard surface of some sort. I haven't read of it breaking off on anyone while chopping wood as of yet?  So I wouldn't worry to much about it breaking off and flying away on ya. However it's always a good rule of thumb to never swing an axe near someone else or have them sitting someplace in line with the arc of your swing even if it is 30 feet away. Just common sense really."
3.0,Good for a small truck axe.  Wouldn't want to chop wood with it every day.
3.0,It's  a pretty good hatchet. I had an older one from about 1989 from east wing that was better but quality seems to be going down on everything now days.the  coating comes off quickly and it will rust unlike my old one. Splits wood ok. The bottom of the handle is hollow and I did manage to bend it pretty good on this one. But I've had it for about eight years now and I still have it so I guess it's ok.
3.0,Its ok. using it on dry hardwood really shocks your hands and wrists. its great on saplings. I would rather spend an extra few bucks and get a Gransfors Bruks or Wetterlings
5.0,"Took the axe camping and it handled the week's worth of firewood with ease. The edge did get extremely chewed up, but it took the abuse. I'll be regrinding the edge and taking it out again next time I camp with complete confidence. The backside of the blade allows for very easy splitting work with a mallet."
4.0,"sharp, strong, bomb proof"
5.0,"My father had an Estwing # 45 axe since the 1960's ~ he wasn't particularly kind to his tools ~ he used them a lot ~
left them where-ever he wanted ~ and didn't make any attempt at preserving or protecting them.
Still ~ his Estwing axe survived ~ I have it now-days ~ cleaned it up ~ sharpened the cutting edge and it's as sharp & useful as ever.

After all these years the leather sheath is still together, it's styled just like the current sheath, with tooled acorns & leaves
and two 1 1/2"" belt slits on the back side for carrying. (older also tooled 'Estwing 45')
The leather needs some TLC to get supple again but the stitching ~ 2 snaps and 8 rivets (now-days 7)
have held up through some diverse times.

Dad used this axe a ton ~ around the farm & on our family vacations (in his pop-up camper) for fire wood ~
and when he was 'blazing a trail' to a new fishing spot.

I noticed this older version is lighter weight ~ 3 lb rather then the current 4.3 pound ~ still the same 26"" length.
Showing some wear & tear ~ which reflects some found memories ~ this old # 45 is still as useful as a new axe.

Bottom line ~ this quality axe will last a life time."
5.0,"Received on time and packaged well. Axe came very sharp with quality leather axe sheath. Well balanced, chops wood well, recommend"
3.0,Kinda small.  More like a big hatchet.
4.0,Nice
1.0,"Came to my door with a damaged edge and a shredded box that was twice the size it needed to be with virtually no packing material, the horrible packing job caused another item to be lost from the box. The grinding on the corners of the steel handle and the outside profiles of the axe head were very roughly done, not the nice smooth polished corners I am used to from Estwing. I own several hammers and an old hatchet that were made so much better than this thing was. What's happened to Estwing?"
5.0,One fine AXE....
5.0,Great axe.it's perfect and real tough.
1.0,"Used this Axe for the first time yesterday and I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this product. I don't chop wood on a daily basis, but I'm pretty sure steel should not bend after an hour of use. Especially since it was the first time I've ever used it. Looking to get a refund or a new axe in hopes that I received a dud."
5.0,Delivered on time and was as expected
5.0,Fantastic tool..I bought this after owning its smaller cousin for many years. Was not let down.
5.0,I am not an easy 5 star rater. I live in Alaska. I split lots of wood. I'm tough on stuff. This axe is like a scalpel. I beat the stuffing out of it.....it's still holding an edge. Buy it.
5.0,"Great sturdy little camp axe, although I would call it more of a long handled hatchet. Certainly adequate for camping, and light weight enough to strap to the side of my pack."
5.0,"Despite the slightly ragged handle molding and crease in the shaft of the axe, everything else on this axe is fantastic. The weight is perfect, the metal seems of good quality, and the handle is very comfortable. I recommend this axe."
5.0,Awesome for throwing to!!
5.0,"Dollar for dollar, this is the only camp axe to buy. The composit ones have horror stories out there. This will stay sharp for quite some time (of course you'll want a stone to keep it that way) is well balanced, and heavy enough to really chop some wood...  But small enough to pack in a pop-up just fine."
1.0,"I was careful not to strip any threads but air leaks out of the top no matter how tight it is.  The photos in the instructions show three different spray patterns with one being a fine mist.  Nope, there are two spray patterns and neither are fine.  For the price, I didn't expect high end quality but this sprayer's components are extremely cheap.  I used it this morning on my potted roses then had to hose down the patio because the spray drenched everything around it.  Spend a little more money and buy a better sprayer."
1.0,"I owned sprayers for years and wish SOMEONE would develop a high quality sprayer that is easy to use and will last. This problem is the biggest reason why people don't take care of their roses as well as they would like to.

This particular sprayer does not hold pressure, requiring you to pump the handle WHILE you are spraying, which is not easy unless you have three hands. At least other sprayers allow you to pump and then spray perhaps 5 bushes before you need to pump the pressure again. Poor design. I'm tossing it after this first use."
1.0,Possibly the worst item I have ever owned. The first model would not work at all. The second one blew a connection and sprayed my face with herbicide. I'll pass on a third attempt.
4.0,"I like these a lot.  I've got two, one for insecticide, one for fungicide.  They're about the size of a large pineapple.  Easy to handle, pump-up, and spray.  The real benefit is that a half-gallon of spray is enough to do  something effective with in the garden, but isn't so much that leftovers  stay in the sprayer forever.
The only thing that prevents me from giving  this 5-stars is I had a problem with broken hose nipples--but Hudson  replaced them for FREE.  So I still recommend these sprayers."
5.0,"Received this ax the other day.  Beautiful workmanship, quality and balance.  This is a work ax that you can not go wrong with."
5.0,I am hard on axes. I have had them all and broken bent or thrown away more junk axes than most folks will ever own. Then a friend told me about this axe and I reluctantly bought one. Wow I had to work on the edge a little and once sharp it works all day and is still sharp and it still has a handle yup! My students can't break this one! I know own 2 and I will never buy a different axe. I will buy another couple of these babies!
5.0,"Awesome! You won't go wrong. Yes, its black paint, yes, when you use an ax, or sharpen an ax, the black paint is going to come off... not a big deal. Estwing is an awesome company!"
5.0,Great for clearing brush! It does not have the weight to chop serious wood
5.0,Made in USA. Arrived lightening fast. Cut wood like silk...Couldn't be happier!
5.0,So much more leverage than a hatchet But almost same weight
4.0,Good
5.0,"I've had my Estwing 45A axe for about 6 years now and thought it would be helpful to review it. This deserves 5 Stars and more.

Outstanding axe in every way. Steel handle. Nylon cushioned grip gives good traction grip and also absorbs much of the impact.
I can chop with this without gloves for short sessions and without getting a blister.

It says it's a 4.3 pound head. Great ergonomics. Easy to swing and retain good control.
The entire head is narrow and slim for good deep chopping and slicing.
But that means it's not designed to be a great log splitter.
So you'll want a good $10 steel wedge for splitting wood. Which is worth having anyway.

The axe head rear is a blunt rectangle and works for tapping in tent stakes.
Estwing ships its axes from the factory with a high quality saddle leather riveted sheath included. Replacement Estwing sheaths alone run about $10 delivered. You always want to be sure your Seller includes the sheath with the axe; some sellers have been known to sell the axe without sheath, then sell the sheaths separately.

These axes usually average around $45 shipped here in Anazon from a multitude of Sellers. Just a fantastic axe.
Built to last a lifetime, then hand down to your kids and grandkids.

Easy to sharpen. These are slim enough to fit into a lot of kitchen-knife sharpeners. And they hold a good edge. Great quality steel.

Can't say enough good things about an Estwing. Famous for good reasons. I heartily recommend these. I love that they're made in the USA.

Hope this is helpful as you research and comparison shop online. Happy trails and enjoy those wood fires, everybody."

But that means it's not designed to be a great log splitter.
So you'll want a good $10 steel wedge for splitting wood. Which is worth having anyway.

The axe head rear is a blunt rectangle and works for tapping in tent stakes.
High quality saddle leather riveted sheath comes with this. Replacement Estwing  sheaths alone run about $10 delivered.
These axes usually average around $45 shipped here in Anazon from a multitude of Sellers. Just a fantastic axe.
Built to last a lifetime, then hand down to your kids and grandkids.

Easy to sharpen. These are slim enough to fit into a lot of kitchen-knife sharpeners. And they hold a good edge. Great quality steel.

Can't say enough good things about an Estwing. Famous for good reasons. I heartily recommend these. I love that they're made in the USA.

Hope this is helpful as you research and comparison shop online. Happy trails and enjoy those wood fires, everybody."
5.0,"Beautiful sharp ax.  Small, will cut logs, but better suited for smaller jobs than splitting wood (but it will split logs if you can't find your ax)."
5.0,Very good axe
5.0,Top notch.
5.0,"Well made, holds an edge, and cuts trees very effectively. The steel one-piece construction of the main section does not break, like the wood or synthetic handles.
I love Estwing's 'Made in US' tools and still have every one I ever purchased."
5.0,This is by far the best damn axe I have ever owned. I chop a lot of wood and have owned many axes. this one is my favorite. I now own nothing but Estwing products.
5.0,"Great feel in the hand, well weighted, awesome product!"
5.0,Awesome for camping.  Sharp and is holding a good edge.
5.0,This axe is really nice. The only problem I've had was when I ordered it there was no mention of a sheath being with it but there was. I ordered one not knowing this. Perhaps one day I'll lose one of them and the extra will come in handy.
5.0,"I had a dead 12-inch diameter cherry tree that needed to be chopped down.  Instead of using a chainsaw, I tried this roughly 25-inch long axe.  It was a workout, but very fulfilling felling a tree like I'm a Lumberjack.  And I'm OK.

Quality of the axe is phenomenal.  The color of the leather sheath (it comes with the axe) reminds me of something you would work with in summer camp, but it is sturdy and handy to have.  I highly recommend this axe."
4.0,Fantastic. Ive been looking at this axe for a while. Its a nice light weight mid sized axe. Great for taking on the wheeler/raft/camping etc. Was always stopped by the price. A little cheaper when I bought this one and it came with the leather embossed cover for the cutting edge that normally sells separately from $10 to $15 about. So bonus. Ad said that but I guess I missed that detail and felt even better about the purchase.
5.0,This is the second E45A I have purchased in 40+ years.  I don't know why they last so long but I needed another for the grandkids to work with.
5.0,"Nice axe, probably bigger than I need but will make easy tasks of the bigger logs. Satisfied with the purchase!"
5.0,
5.0,MADE IN AMERICA! works as described. Thank you Estwing for making such quality products. I still have my grandfather's Estwing hammer made over 50 years ago works and performs perfectly. Estwing= quality
5.0,"Sharpened, and carry with me always."
3.0,"I first got this axe with a major chip in the blade, contacted Amazon, and they promptly shipped me out a replacement. I got the second axe, and this time the axe had a minor chip in the blade that could be worked out with a whetstone or grinder. After some deducing, I found that the sheathe is what has caused the problem. When you place the axe into the sheathe for ""safe"" storage, the blade comes across the bottom of two metal buttons on the inside. Not realizing that they're there can land your blade into some serious trouble. Also, the blade (when properly inserted into the sheathe) butts up against several grommets on the edge of the sheathe that hold it together. If dropped, or shipped improperly, these grommets can be forced into the blade and cause damage. Obviously what you're buying here is a good axe. But a reputable company like Estwing should be doing so much more for their customers than shipping them with a destructive sheathe. I'm seriously."
5.0,"Avery handy item it works  for the purpose you use it, worth the price paid for it ,"
5.0,Awesome Axe great for cutting branches off trees that I cut down for firewood !!!
4.0,"So far I have only used it around the house. I will update after my next camping trip. The axe would not easily split seasoned blocks of pine. Axe is MUCH lighter then I expected which is good and bad. Good for carrying, bad for splitting blocks of wood. Decent sized axe not too big and not a small hatchet. Construction seems well made as expected. Lowest importance is the looks. But the axe looks amazing. I do not own nor have I used the blue one to compare. They suckered me into this one simply for the blacked out style. I would have bought the blue one if the metal head of the axe was blue instead of unfinished though.

**Update** I took this axe out on my camping trip over the weekend. The axe performed well in the few different things I used it for. I used it to create two posts for my tarp. The axe cut the small 1 to 1.5 in diameter branch in one swing as well as stripped off the smaller branches with no effort at all. I found a larger branch of roughly 4"" in diameter and used this axe to chop it down to small logs for the fire. The axe made fairly quick work of the log and would have performed better if I was a better lumberjack Lol. Of the blows that landed in the same area it was quickly chopped up usually 4 or 5 hits in the same area in alternating angles cut the branch enough to split it from the rest very easily. The axe also split blocks of pine I brought with me rather easily. The axe was a good investment in my eyes and still maintained its edge even after a weekend of me using it. For this I am giving it four stars. I will update this over time and adjust as needed."
5.0,Juat what was needed. Fast delivery.
3.0,"The finished product is great, but took over three hours to assemble (probably 100 or more parts, poor assembly instructions).  When ordering, I saw no information indicating ""assembly required."""
4.0,HELL OF LOTA WORK TO PUT IT TO GETHER NILLION PARTS FOR PRICE SHOULD BE ASSEMBLED ALLREDY
3.0,"Hard kit to assemble. Use gloves! The kit was imcomplete, but the mfg. quickly sent me the missing part. The house only attracted a family of Starlings. Maybe next year?!"
1.0,This was a complete disaster. It came in a thousand pieces. So we returned it and were charged $45.00 for freight. Amazon is in the freight business.
5.0,"It is of course, immensley important to encourage wild bird life to your garden but you have to think carefully about how you are going to do that. Don't make it too luxurious or the birds loose vital skills, don't make it too unrecognisable or they won't use it and it'll be an expensive Garden ornament.

 Of course, put it out of harm's reach too, cats, foxes etc!

 The other important thing is reducing the risk of infection from bird poop, this can be cleaned thoroughly once the little dears have gone away for Winter. Practical, pretty and well used every year and you WILL get more than Martins!"
5.0,NICE!!!
4.0,I have only used it once but I can say that this sucker is solid. All steel. With a grip handle.
4.0,the only ax you need
5.0,Excellent AXe. Made in USA. Light and very thin. Great for camping and splitting smaller logs or branches for kindling or fire wood. Not the greatest when it comes to big logs. It gets stuck easy. For bigger logs I would use a Fiskars axe.
5.0,It's an Estwing !! Enough said.
5.0,Very  good  AX
5.0,Got this for my son who spends every minute he can hiking and camping.  He loves it!
5.0,There was a wierd warning about how the chemical might cause infertility I m not sure wat California people do with this ax I just used it to chop some branches and its awesome. Lol
4.0,"I literally cut down a tree with this thing. It works just fine, and seems to hold its edge as well."
5.0,Super.
5.0,very well built
5.0,"Gosh this thing is light for its size.......Impressive!

I actually keep this strapped on my Enduro Bike, hatches don't really compare to this thing, consider this almost a full size axe you can throw in your back pack no problem.

Im not going to say its the best splitter axe for big dense pieces of wood.... but its 10x better then any tomahawk or hatchet at splitting for that matter....
And for the money, this is ridiculous value...

Also because it feels so light, id even say this could be a weapon of opportunity if need be...

the only mod I might do is blue the steel, cause im not too into the polished look...."
5.0,My riggers axe came up missing after all these years and I got this for the kindling/camping box.  I like it but much as I like it I still need to get another rigging / framing axe from Estwing.
5.0,"Very nice tool. Arrived sharp and ready to go. The handle length is perfect between an axe and a hatchet. A bit too much for backpacking, but vehicle based camping is where this tool shines. Blade profile is what it should be as well."
5.0,"Great for splitting or felling trees under 12"". Very strong and light weight. I often wear mine on my belt to clear trails or delimb large trees after felling. I call mine the samurai because it's very fast and can be used one handed.  Be careful though could cut off a toe or hit your shin if you get careless.  I highly recommend for light duty work."
5.0,Great axe!!!
5.0,Awesome size and usefullness for camping
4.0,Nice tool. Would be great if it was etched instead of stickers.
5.0,"Made in the USA. You won't break this handle when your trainees miss the log. Good size, not too heavy."
5.0,"Bought this axe for my husband.  He loves it!!  Found him in the garage yesterday splitting wood with it with a big grin on his face.  I asked him what I should write about it in the review.  He said it's ""Bad Ass!!""  Don't know whether I'm allowed to say that here or not, but that is his review :)!!"
5.0,"Can't say I have a lot of experience with axes (first one), but for what it's worth, the novice likes this axe.  It's no saw, but for little branches even up to thigh-width branches (I suppose that depends on your size...), it is surprisingly effective."
5.0,Great axe
5.0,Toughest axe I've ever owned
5.0,"I made this one a present for my dad, which this whole winter has been regularly chopping wood for fire back home in Romania and so far he tells me it still cuts/ chops as good as in its first day so I totally recommend it. Careful around it as with its sharp blade and poor handling you may end up with deep/ sharp cuts or even missing fingers."
4.0,"Love this axe. My dad has one just like it he's had for 30 years, but I decided to buy my own instead of stealing his :-D
Only problem is that I use it a fair bit as a throwing axe and the steel shaft between the rubber grip and the head warped pretty quickly, putting a bow in it that's pretty noticeable when looking at it from the poll side. I think it's because of the way it often strikes with the toe of the head first, but it hasn't affected the performance of the axe as far as I can tell so far... I just don't think my dad's one would have done that. Tool steel just isn't what it was. Took one star off for that, but it still swings, strikes, splits, and throws true."
4.0,Just what I needed.
5.0,My husband loves this ax. We got it yesterday an he was out chopping tree roots in the yard this morning. He says it is easy to swing and he has good control with it. He likes not having to worry about a wooden handle breaking.
5.0,our son loved this Christmas gift!
5.0,Awesome product.  Very happy.
5.0,great tool
1.0,"Well, number one problem, takes too long to put together. And then number two you have to dig the hole and then cement it....  then wait ANOTHER 24 hrs...so
  The whole operation took us about 5 or 6 days.....we quit for Sunday, then it rain couple of days......And as of today which is Wednesday of the same week, we still don't have it up. We have had the Martin scouting around."
5.0,purple martins are loving their new home.
4.0,"Had a little trouble with missing parts but received those pretty quickly.  My 13 yr old grandson helped in putting it together, was fairly easy.  Really pleased with the way it looks.  A little concerned about the size of the openings, thought they would be a little smaller.  Putting it up today. Will let you know how well it works."
5.0,perfect
1.0,"My kit arrived missing two center brackets. Result was I could only build 3 of the 4 floors. Calling the number of Heath Outdoor Products yielded an answering machine and no return call. Amazon seems to only allow replacements or refunds. I want to keep the 3 floors I built, but would like the two parts I was promised but which were not delivered. I don't know how accomplish that."
5.0,"It is bigger and better than I thought. It is made out of sheet metal and should last for years. They say it works best when mounted on telescoping pole made by the same company. I had to assemble it. It took me 3-4 hours. I actually enjoyed it because the instructions were perfect. It was like an erector set. I am elderly, but most elderly people would think it is too difficult. They only gave me the exact number of little bolts and nuts. Two did not work. I forced one and the threads caught. I had to find a replacement for the last bolt. But I had one in the basement. I hope I am not too late for the arrival of the birds. The rails were hard for me to install; my son did that."
5.0,It was a gift to my daughter. She loved it ( she is a bird watcher). I also got the 14ft aluminum for it. It was easy to install.  Now waiting for the purple martins to move in. Thank you
2.0,"Flimsy metal with tiny bolts that make it very difficult to work with. Plan on about 3 hours to assemble this mess.  The rails do not snap into place easily and soon as I set it up on the pole, 2 of the rails already came off.  Very poorly designed, would not recommend this product, and I am pretty handy and building and assembling projects."
2.0,"Assembly is difficult and time-consuming.  Problem is exacerbated by the acute angles of the pieces and the short length of some of the screws.  Some 1/4"" screws have to go through three metal pieces and have the bolt attached in a very narrow space, where it is not possible to hold with fingers.  I had to use a pair of surgical clamps to hold the bolt against the screw.  Also, there are almost 100 pieces to assemble, not counting bolts and nuts.  Additionally, two pieces were missing, and I had to call the company to mail the missing pieces, which it did and did so promptly.  On the plus side, plugs for the entry holes are provided, giving you the option of how many nesting spaces you want to use.  The directions are generally complete and accurate, but they could be presented more clearly.  Attaching the rails is difficult to do without bending the floor piece."
1.0,"Be prepared to shoot yourself in the head if you order this , its a million pieces. If my husband kills me tonight I swear I deserve it "
2.0,Extra screws and nuts should be included in package. Parts very sharp and cuts in my hands and arms. Instructions for attaching stories together does not exist. Assembly time is minimum of 5 hours. Porch rails difficult to install.
5.0,bought as present for my brother -- installed earlier in week and martins have already visited -- assembly was not that difficult -- just be patient
4.0,"Very difficult to put together. I suggest using pop rivits instead of the bolts it comes with, it will save you a lot if time. You have to find 5/32 rivits which is an odd size."
4.0,"It is difficult to assemble when it comes time to attach the roof - the provided 1/4 inch screws are too short to easily assemble three panels (two roof sections and a wall) at once.  Before you start to assemble this, get six 1/2 - 3/4 inch 6-32 screws.
After struggling (and cussing) for at least a 1/2 hour to attach the roof with the supplied screws, I connected the outside corners of the roof panels together by inserting 3/4 inch screws from the bottom and lightly screwed down nuts on the top side.  This held the roof together in the proper shape. Then, with the roof upside-down, I took these screws one-at-a-time and inserted them from the top side and into the wall panels, loosely installing the nuts on each corner before continuing to the next corner.  It was lot easier and four-letter words were no longer used..

Also, as others have noted, the railings tend to pop out of their holes, so be sure to turn the floor sections up-side down and apply some sort of glue where the railing posts stick through.  I used ""super glue."""
2.0,"When people write that this is painful to put together - IT'S TRUE.
I would have paid $100 more for get it put together. Have gloves and bandaids ready."
3.0,"great item, very hard to put together. nice item, very large."
4.0,"The purple martin birdhouse we ordered was received with all parts.  It took my wife and I approximately six hours over a two-day time frame to assemble it using the provided instructions (with the help of our screwdrivers and sockets).  It would be helpful if the product could be ordered fully assembled, even if it means paying an assembly fee."
5.0,"Love this product for the price. It takes patients and time to assemble, but worth the time."
4.0,"A little difficult to put together.
If you are using this for Purple Martins...read up on where to place it..."
4.0,"This was SOOO hard to put together, and then mounting it the screws started falling out. We got it to where it would stay together. It's full now, so the birds like it. I'm good with that. But next time I'll buy one that's already assembled - and pay the money for it."
5.0,"These sprinkler valves are foolproof until they do not work.  Then the hunt is on, is it the solenoid? break in the pipe? just did not feel like working that day? a massive water leak? So I pull my hair out wondering why I can not solve my problem with such a simple, well made valve.

Jimmy"
3.0,"Note for those of you buying this to use this as a pilot for a spud gun or other unintended use (this is relevant since I believe that this is _the most popular_ model for that use, I'm sure that Amazon, Rainbird, the vender supplying it or me don't condone this use at all)- the current shipping valve is different than in the picture.

The base appears to be the same, but the top half is no longer gray and the bleed has been moved to the side rather than centered.  That has the odd result that the threaded area that people have been using to trigger it is no longer in the reinforced center, making this a weaker design.  I don't know if it will hold up long term, or if drilling and tapping the center is a better solution than using the mount for the blead.  If nothing else, there isn't nearly as much plastic to cut threads into in that area, and I suspect that by the time you did it you would cause interference problems with the diaphragm spring.  Right now I'm debating if I'm going to drill/modify the existing part, drill the passage that normally gets blocked off to the solenoid valve and machine an adapter to mount the release there or machine a whole new top for it.

Good Luck..."
5.0,"This is a great sprinkler valve, I'm glad to buy it.

It is easy to modify for pneumatic working if you want it in your spud gun."
1.0,Hard to assemble. The birds looked but did not stay.
3.0,"Takes way too long to assemble, too many nuts and bolts.  6 hours into building and still not done.  Better have lots of patience and small hands to build. Instructions are aweful. If I could do it again I'd buy a product already mostly assembled."
5.0,"Plastic railings do not stay on well, hole covers blow off in the wind, but the birds love it."
4.0,Was a lot to put together but so far it has held up. I will update after a few more months to give a fair and accurate update.
5.0,Great price and prefect home for my martins.  Very reasonable and good quality.  Takes 2 people to put together.
4.0,"Bit of a hassle putting the roof together , looks great when finished ."
4.0,Buy a rivet gun. Using rivets will shorten assembly time a bunch. Just be double sure what you are doing. Great design. Not sure how to tighten each level to the mounting post.
4.0,"took a considerable time to assemble, but looks good. Want know for sure how it works until we get it up on a secure pole than can tolerate winds at the coast and during the migration of the purple martins."
3.0,House was good but it will only fit the telescoping pole that was recommended. The top of the pole is tapered and it is not explained that I could fine fine so you can't make it work with the pole I already had up for my old Martin house. Pole cost nearly as much as house. Should sell together.
4.0,"1) Instruction... throw them away, they are worthless.. I used the pics on the box to show me how to assemble.
2) Buy bandaids! These edges are sharp and you will find new cuts on your hands even 24 hours later.
3) Screws, screws, and more screws.  Wow.. lots of screws.... Reminds me of a kids erector sets.
4) When we moved into our house 4 years ago the previous owners had one of these already set up.  I can say these things are durable.
5) Seems to always be occupied.  Birds seems to love it."
2.0,"I have had it up for three years and no birds. I had it up at one house for two years and one year here at our new house. I would not care if it were Sparrows or any other bird, just want a bird to make a home there."
3.0,"I asked John Mccain to help me with assembly of this birdhouse and he told me he would rather go back to POW camp than to build this monstrosity. It is like the company held a contest to see how thin they could get the metal , how many parts they could require , and how difficult they could make assembly.  If you have big hands be prepared to curse like a sailor while trying to get 1/4"" screws through 3 sheets of metal and attach a bolt in the corner of the metal.  I had to triple dose my Lexipro while assembling so I did not HULK SMASH this thing. One amazing part required me  to put in 12 screws (advising you not to tighten them too tightly) and then required me to then unscrew 6 of them while holding room together and adding rooms. FUN!  Add to this assembly the challenge of not cutting my fat fingers to the bone while contorting tin so thin that Coke refused it for canned soda.
When completed it is a very nice looking birdhouse. I feel like the blood I spilled in the birdhouse is a sacrifice to the Purple Martin gods so the house will stay full of bird families.
If deciding to build another or smashing my thumb with a hammer it would be  toss up."
1.0,"This was not my first time at assembling birdhouses or anything made with metal or plastic. When I received my boxed Purple Martin house and telescoping pole set, I realized this product should advertise how long it will take to assemble. Perhaps you fail to disclose that due to the lack of sales. The pole flange is made of plastic and that was your first mistake. I went through 2 of them and looks like there was a manufacturing flaw or a design flaw. When tightening the metal bolt against the metal pole using the plastic pole flange with plastic threads, you can only apply so much pressure before the plastic threads become stripped. What other solutions do you have? I won't try or waste my time with another plastic pole flange. Unfortunately my retailer won't return an already assembled product and I doubt I can see it for what I paid. Don't waste your time!
Also, they should of supplied locking nuts, better instructions, metal pole flange with metal threads and a way to attach each level together."
1.0,Putting this house together has been a nightmare. Still haven't finished after 4 weeks. Buy it all ready assembled.
3.0,This is a build project. Do not expect it complete
5.0,"Great product!  Took longer than expected to assemble, but once all together it looks great!"
1.0,If you're on the verge of divorce or even remotely suicidal do not buy this! It will put you right over the edge. Can only add second level if you buy their telescoping pole. We didn't want the pole. We had a place to put it that doesnt require a pole.  Feel totally ripped off but I'll be damned if I'm going to take one level and roof apart again to send it back!
1.0,"Assembly is a nightmare, finished product is flimsy, and all edges are sharp."

5.0,Made in the USA. One piece steel. Good edge retention. Portable design. Does what it is made for. Buy it.
4.0,"This is a good ""axe"". Estwing makes good products and they last a long time with appropriate maintenance.

On this particular model, don't be mistaken by the depiction in the pictures. It is shorter than one perceives it to be. You will not be splitting thick logs with this axe. It is designed for processing smaller trees and bush. Maybe even debarking a log or tree. But splitting isn't feasible due to its short handle, thin metal, and light head.

On the note of its build though, it is as the quality of all Estwing tools. The handle is comfortable and holds up well to all elements. The weatherproofing coating they put on the metal is nice, but does ware of rather quickly so be sure to keep it well oiled and maintained. I would also HIGHLY suggest buying a ""puck"" sharpener with this and all axe like tools. It is a nice, easy way to quickly sharpen in the field and doesn't add that much weight to ones pack.

All in all, this is a good tool for what it is built for. Just don't confuse it for a wood splitting axe.

In Jesus' name you're healed."
5.0,I used this axe quite a lot. Easy to sharpen and cuts through wood like butter. Can't go wrong with this axe
5.0,Very sharp. I use for a companion to my chainsaw. For limbs and brush clearing. Very sturdy. I have even drove steel splitting wedges with it.
1.0,"No recoil absorbing quality in the handle. Low quality steel. Handle became bent after felling a 12"" diameter tree. After one outing, this axe was scrap metal. Spend real money = get a real axe"
3.0,"Why I like this axe:
1) It is solid steel.  It may at some point bend if I push it too far using it as a pry bar, but normal everyday use isn't going to phase it. The head cannot come off.  Until a catastrophic failure, functionality is practically guaranteed.
2) It has a rubber grip.  Everything can slip, but this helps a lot and eliminates the shock to your hands.  It's comfortable to chop with barehanded or in gloves.
3) It has a narrower head than most axes. The head fits my Lansky pocket sharpener, making it quick and easy to sharpen. I don't need it sharp enough to shave with, just sharp.  Being able to put a quick edge on it is nice.
4) Estwing is known for their hammers and the poll of this axe makes a nice one.

What I don't like about this axe are mostly unforeseen repercussions of the all metal construction and 26"" handle.  This is really Estwing's 44A hatchet with a longer handle.  I bought it based on the theory that a longer handle would make it easier to chop and add a greater range of function. Well, it didn't work out like that.
1) You can't comfortably choke up on the handle.  The part of the handle just below the head is thin, sturdy but thin.  It is uncomfortable to grip the bare metal. The section just below that isn't much better. On an axe with a wooden handle, anywhere I grabbed the handle would be a comfortable hand position.  Being forced to grip the axe on the bottom third of a 26"" handle starts to limit its uses.  I found I could swing it, but that was about it.  I couldn't choke up to scrape or shave wood.  I couldn't baton with it easily. It had me considering getting a hatchet and putting this axe in the shed.
2) The metal gets cold.  I live in Ohio. It gets cold outside.  So, if you use it in the winter, and you need to choke up on the axe, your hands are going to get cold.
3) It just doesn't split. Maybe I was lured in by the long handle, but I couldn't split wood with it.  The head is the wrong shape and it is too light. This really isn't the fault of the axe. It wasn't designed for splitting wood. But the 26"" handle gave me hopes.

What I ended up doing was wrapping the handle in paracord.  It allows me to use more of the handle and keeps my hands from getting cold. I batoned wood comfortably in 25 degree weather. It also protects the handle a little and stashes 30 feet of paracord in my kit. I went the quick and dirty route when wrapping the handle, but some internet videos show wraps that border on artistic."
5.0,I bought this as a replacement to my wooden handle axe that I have carried in my camping kit for 20 years.  The Estwing should last even longer. After one season it seems to fit its need.  I don't chop down trees with the thing but it handles making kindle just fine.  It has a good feel and I like the swing weight.
5.0,Very good axe for the money.
4.0,"Very nice finish love the matte black and the almost baseball bat feel of this axe.  But it is definetly more of a tactical and tree finishing style axe.  For taking down brush, taking off limbs of fallen tree and skinning trees as well.  Even maight be a good hunting axe.  The laynydard hole was not matched up with the rubber grip when I received the axe as a gift.  I will probably drill through it and add a lanyard.  Also comes with a decent nylon protective sheath that can be attached to a belt or pack.  I am happy with this axe.  And Estwing is k ow for their quality craftsmanship and long lives."
5.0,"Bought this for our Boy Scout Troop. It works great, is built very solidly, and the perfect length for both the adults and the scouts."
5.0,PERFECT! Great bird house for birds that eat TONS of mosquitos!

The house takes some time to build; but once done, its light, sturdy, well design.  The floors drop out easy for cleaning; no screws to remove when cleaning, they pop out.  Each floor slides on the pole individually and is secured bebeath the higher floors independently

Nice.
See my pics"
5.0,"Seemed like a million pieces, but as long as we read the directions first, we put it together perfectly."
4.0,"I didn't read reviews closely; I didn't realize I had to put it together. Once I got going, it wasn't hard. It is a nice, big house. I got the three floor, eighteen room house. Just know, you need nimble fingers for very small screws and bolts. And the metal pieces are very sharp edged."
5.0,lots of assembly but looks nice up.
1.0,One of the hardest things I have ever had to assemble!  Four hours.  One of the bolts had bad threads and there were no extra so it also required a trip to the hardware store.  The instructions are very poor and the diagrams are almost unusable.  Several times during installation I almost gave up.  I highly suggest not purchasing this product.  It is just too much trouble to assemble.
4.0,"It's lovely and sturdy and I hope to get many years of enjoyment out of it, but the manufacturer really needs to replace or retrain the employee who writes the assembly instructions.  It isn't difficult, and one person can do it, but the directions definitely need to be clearer.  Oh, and it would be nice if they'd splurge and include slightly longer bolts.  3/8"" instead of 1/4"" would make the job a lot easier and would not detract from the look or the use of the birdhouse at all."
5.0,"I originally bought a similar Orbit solenoid valve.  Two of them leaked (when off), so Home Depot replaced them.  Of the 4 zones I have installed, the rear ones leaked occasionally, and the front ones almost all the time.  Not Full On, but enough to soak the ground underneath and make a mess.  So I switched to RainBird and they are good so far.  No Leaks"
1.0,"My 25-year old river fed system has 3 in-line valves, all Rain Bird.  DIY installation.  Last winter one of the valves was damaged by snow removal.  Replaced it with this CP100 in April.  NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.  The new valve will not shut off after power is removed by the controller.  Therefore the two remaining lines do not have enough water to operate properly.  Draining the valve to remove any contamination works for only one cycle.  Since the other 25 year old valves still operate perfectly, I suspect that Rain Bird has changed the design or cheapened the materials.  DO NOT RECOMMEND."
5.0,"Very good valves, they work without problem. Will definitely buy more and recommend"
5.0,What I expected
5.0,"I am not an expert on sprinkler valves, but I can say that this valve was easy to install and seems to be working well.  My other one was over 20 years old and needed to be put to rest."
5.0,All good
5.0,works great
5.0,Exclelente
5.0,"I added one of these to the 32ETI sprinkler kit, along with an internal controller and rain sensor to fully automate the system.  It works great!  Love that the valve can be manually operated to test and immediately water without going to the controller.  Great valve and great value."
5.0,"These appear to be high quality valves.  I am pleased that they match in appearance, regardless of configuration.  The installation was simple and straightforward.  I expect these to remain in service for at least five years.  I will keep them covered and shoot for a decade though."
5.0,Great birdhouse!  We had one just like this for over 15 years until the West Texas winds snapped the post. Takes a little while to put together but not hard at all.  It's back on the post and the birds are already moving in!  I'm not picky about who lives there. They are all welcome!  Good value!
4.0,Beautiful addition to the garden. Must be very careful while assembling very sharp metal. Don't let children try to help.
3.0,"I am a tradesman and I consider myself very handy and this took me 3 full hours to build. The directions were very weak and could use some better info and pictures. For the price a more graphic set could be printed for those who are not used to fabricating.

I was missing parts but luckily I ordered two of them so I was still able to complete one build today.

In all it looks great but it really is a pain to build and is a bit flimsy."
5.0,"Love the house, but didn't read the fine print...it came in a million pieces!  Thank goodness I have a very talented brother who was a shop teacher and knows a lot and he had it together in about an hour.  If you are an English major but one already put together.  Looks good and is of great quality."
4.0,Although tedious in the construction of the bird house. In the hands of a mechanically inclined person or a DIY guy or gal it is of sturdy construction. It will be a appealing and lasting fixture on the property for years to come. The wife and I love it. Our Martins dig it too.
1.0,Too many pieces and time consuming to put together.  The top roof very flimsy.  I do not recommend this item.
4.0,"Just what I needed.
Birds love it."
1.0,"I had been looking for a purple Martin house and found this one. It was even marked down. I now know why. It was bent when we opened the box and it looks more like a jigsaw puzzle than a bird house. The instructions are terrible and don't address how to connect the two floors. The metal is also flimsy. And don't even think of getting this if you have big hands. Small, tight spaces need small hands to put nuts on. Too much work was put into it to send it back."
3.0,I'm giving this item 3 stars because of how difficult it is to assemble and how clear the directions are. I consider myself very mechanically inclined and really enjoy assembling items that I buy. This bird house really kicked my rear. It took 3 1/2 hours to assemble and if you don't have a third hand you might as well forget putting the roof on! After hours of kicking and screaming like a 2 year old I managed to finish. It does look like a very nice bird house that will last a long time.
5.0,"Very nice bird house , alot of work to put together but worth it"
4.0,Works fine.
2.0,No way to manually turn off valve at the valve.
5.0,"Nice little valve, I'm using it as a control valve for my pool solar heater, very little power needed to open and close it. responds fast and the quality is to notch."
5.0,These are nice well built (solid) valves
5.0,So far it has worked beautifully
5.0,WORKS FINE
5.0,"It is an excellent valve, and worked well with my Rain Bird sprinkler controller"
5.0,Rain bird is the way to go. Orbit is junk
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"No issues. If you're reading this review, then you know what you need.  Have fun digging!"
5.0,"This axe really has to be held in your hands to be appreciated. I ordered this for my dad and within seconds of taking it out of the box I could already tell that he will love it. It has great balance, perfect head weight, and just feels sturdy as hell due to it being all one piece of American steel. It's black finish is also very pleasing on the eyes. It comes VERY sharp, so keep the sheath on until you plan to use it/gift it. The only odd thing is that it was delivered with an extra box in tow, both shipped from the same factory with my name/address on them. One box had the axe and the other had a  Bosch circular saw ($150 value). I double-checked my credit card and I was not charged for the saw, so....thanks? My one cool gift for my dad just turned into 2!"
5.0,"Like all Estwing products we buy, these are fantastic.  Well balanced.  Does what it is supposed to do.  Durable.  Will last many, many years.  ..... and is made in the USA!!  You can ""never"" go wrong buying quality USA built tools.  Pay more, they are worth it."
2.0,Handle broke and it is useless
2.0,Don't expect this axe to split logs. Go with a Fiskars for that. It arrives dull. I like the leather sheath. After some sharpening I can maybe use it to chop down some standing dead trees when camping but the length makes it inconvenient to carry while hiking.
5.0,Excellent camping tool.
5.0,"A great back woods decapitor for chickens, deer, and various roadkill!"
5.0,It's great light weight. Use this when I go hiking so weight is everything. It's full tang which has been great. It will be part of my gear for many years to come. Plus the price on here was much less than at retailers near me by about 30 35 dollars cheaper to be exact.
5.0,This has become my favorite tool at the deer lease
3.0,"Looks great but who cares I don't model axes. steel sucks, chipped blade twice minor use. Added Wilson tennis tape for better grip.
Just buy a machete its lighter. Spent 4 K on random hunting stuff this was my worst purchase."
4.0,"I have a hatchet made by Estwing that I have used for over 30 years. I have accidentally hit nails in timbers with it and have never dented the cutting edge. I just bought this ax because of the quality.
I went out to the back yard where I have a big pond to break the two inch ice on the surface  so the animals have water to drink.  I have done this in the past with the hatchet, the ax works better. When I came in to put the sheath back on I noticed there were dents in the cutting edge. How could this be,I was only hitting ice.
Well I'm going to keep an eye on this, I not very impressed.
Other than that I really  like the length, I'm tall so I can put this on my belt and have my hands free, and it is light enough that I can use it like a hatchet with a long handle. Plus it's all one piece, no more missing my mark and breaking/splintering the handle. For me that's a big plus.
There's plenty of blade to resharpen."
5.0,A little tough to assemble (due to tiny nuts & bolts) but very nice once it is. Make sure you read directions through several times to get roof assembly right. Looks awesome next to our other two Martin houses.
2.0,"In the quality control. Purchased two of these. Each of the wall pieces that attach to the Center Bracket were about 1/8 inch too wide. This caused the house to torque. This caused the Floor Panels to be un-even along the leading edge. To remedy, I used metal shears to remove the excess width, this allowed the house to align properly and the floor panels to line up. I would suggest whomever manufactures the product to calibrate their metal shear."
5.0,Very nice. It works
1.0,Missing parts and Heath Outdoor products says its not there problem. Would suggest looking at other manufactures.
3.0,"I sent this house to my son to bring the wonderful purple martins to enjoy the birds and help with the bugs. He spent over 3 hours putting this house together, the information on the site didn't say the house had to be COMPLETELY assembled."
1.0,This item is in a zillion pieces. Sharp edges cut fingers... DON'T BUY IT... I will sell you mine for half!
1.0,the house looks real good but the purple martins we have had nesting at our place for years looked over this tin house and left!! its been over a week and they have not came back.
3.0,Already rented to several matins an freeloading sparrows
5.0,Excellent product. Exactly as advertised. Superb shipping.
1.0,do not waste your money on this. it is poorly designed and mostly a piece of garbage. I would return it but I have invested too much time in it to disassemble.
5.0,Excelent. Thanks.
5.0,Works As Advertised!  Think Rain Bird would also sell a hole in the ground to help with all the digging.
5.0,Ok
1.0,valve not working
5.0,Product arrived quickly and is performing just as expected. Thank you.
5.0,Will order more
5.0,Works Great
4.0,As advertised.
5.0,"Works perfect, just as expected."
5.0,
5.0,Easy to put together I'm going to buy another
4.0,Purchased as a gift.
5.0,Just as described & look great. It could use longer bolts to hold the roof on. Also the floors & rails come out to easy.
4.0,Awesome house.  Quality materials.  The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is because it takes so long to assemble.  Many pieces.  Once you get it together its great.  Can't wait for this years Purple Martins to arrive.
4.0,Love
5.0,Looks great up on poll.  It takes some effort to put together but not difficult.  The Blue Birds are the ones who nest in it.  We looked at many choices - this one came in 1st.
5.0,great job
5.0,"Nice bird house, takes a while to put together other than that it's just fine."
1.0,"Absolute disappointment.  Poorly designed and nearly impossible to assemble.  Bet it won't ""hold up"" more than a single season in the elements.  Keep looking for a better solution to your needs."
4.0,It takes a long time to put together which I agree. Once together it is sturdy and looks great. Also it is a modular design so I can add additional levels as this one fills up.
5.0,Great Item!  Fast Shipping!  Just What I Wanted!!
5.0,I really like Rain Bird products they seem to work better than Orbit products.
3.0,For basic residential use this valve is ok.  It is made of cheap plastic.  If you ever need to remove the top to clean out the valve DO NOT use a power screwdriver as you may crack the plastic casing.
5.0,It did what it was supposed to do
5.0,"What can I say, It works well."
5.0,Great product great price
5.0,"good dependable easy to hook up, will buy some more"
5.0,Great replacement product
5.0,Excellent valve
5.0,I have used quite a few of these valves through out the years.  They have always performed well..
3.0,"Good house, but takes FOREVER to put together!"
5.0,Good quality product.  Takes lots of time to put together.
2.0,Very difficult to put together.
1.0,impossible to put together!! no way to easily clean.
2.0,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but I did purchse this model number.  I have never written a review, and I mean to tell you I purchase a lot of stuff.. The assembly of this unit only took me and my wife 8 hours to put it together The poorly written instructions, a bag full of tiny bolts and nuts and more sharp die-cut pieces of aluminum than you can count! The instruction did state, watch and be careful of all those sharp edges, becauce they will cut you. But if you have a lot of time, small hands, patience and a good relationship with your wife, this is the birdhouse you want to buy"
4.0,"I purchased this Martin House a month ago after the vinyl, 12 apartment house began to show serious signs of deterioration.  The unit arrived and was packaged well.  I had read about assembly, particularly that it took substantial time because of all the small nuts and bolts, as well as the odd angles of the structure and that turned out to be true.  The unit took over two hours to assemble and is extremely lightweight.  Each floor of the house has to be attached to the pole individually and because of that, cleaning might be tricky.  The birds do not like to return in the spring  when the apartments haven't been cleaned, so the floors must be cleaned from the bottom of each.  Additionally, I do not like the spire on top; it is not securely attached and possibly could be dislodged by wind.

Since it was near the end of the season and the newborn birds hadn't left the house, I will be putting it up this week with the vinyl plugs provided so that it is ready for next season.
It seems to be structurally sound and attractive, but my neighbor bought a Trio and it seems to be even stronger and with considerable ease to clean.  As the old adage goes, time will tell."
5.0,The birds love the house. The only problem we encountered was the railing on the porches don't stand up to high wind - would suggest that you glue the railings in place.
3.0,"Would have given 5 stars but we were missing a section of this and had to call and wait for manufacturer to ship it to us making it late to be given as a birthday gift.  Also you do have to have a lot of patience,  correct tools and time as it is very difficult to put together. Thank my husband for doing this for my sister!!"
5.0,"a quality product,well made"
2.0,"Hard to get together,  mounting post has no way to secure it from not rotating, post sections are way too tight."
5.0,Works great!
5.0,good value
5.0,"love these rainbirds, had some orbits from home depot but they just didn't work as good as the rainbirds."
5.0,Very good
5.0,great item and great price
5.0,I have six of these in use for 4 months and they haven't missed a beat. Going to install more in the near future.
5.0,WORKS GREAT
5.0,Perfect
5.0,love it
5.0,Great water valve for any application
4.0,Nice axe but the hole in the handle was not drilled completely through the handle.
5.0,Arrived very quickly.  Great quality - my son is very happy with it.
5.0,Very nice axe and high quality.
5.0,"This is a perfect sized ax for camping.  This isn't an ax for chopping cords of wood!  The name brand implies its life-long quality, no need for more words there.  Good mix of steel for keeping a sharp edge for a while."
5.0,"Like it, it is exactly what I wanted."
5.0,One of the best axes you can buy but is a little short. If it was another 6inches longer it would be perfect.
4.0,"As other reviewers have stated, the axe blade is quite thin. So while it can make deep cuts, IF you cut with the grain of the wood (as one does when splitting) the blade tends to bind in the wood and you have to rock it back and forth to loose the blade from the wood. I did not sharpen my axe before testing it on a water oak stump, it was very sharp when I got it brand new. I've used quite a few axes, splitting mauls, hatchets, and sledge hammers in my time so I know how to swing one of these striking tools. This axe is very easy to swing and I did not find the handle to transmit too much shock to my hands. In fact, I didn't notice any more shock from this steel tool than I have from many of the hickory handled tools I've used. The weight of this tool is forward (in the head) which aids in giving you a good, strong strike. This is a ""forest axe"" blade design. Overall, the tool is light and is a very fast axe!

DISCLAIMER: The following information may be disturbing to some shoppers; reader discretion is advised (you've been warned!).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the thin profile of the axe head, the tools reasonably light weight, and the ability to maintain a solid grip on it do to good length and shape--along with the grip material on the handle, this tool might be suitable for those who raise their own food or process meat. The weight, shape, and grip enable a very accurate blow to be struck with this. So far, I have been able to hit exactly the spot I was aiming to hit with this axe. The thin blade profile enables to tool to make deep, clean cuts with a single blow. On larger animals where you must contend with larger bones and joints, this axe would be perfect for quickly quartering game or making the appropriate separation at a troublesome joint. Being also that it's nearly one entire piece (except for the grip material) it would be much easier to clean this than many other axes and hatches that I've used in the past. For birds or smaller animals (e.g. chickens, rabbits, etc.), it could go without saying that this would quickly and cleanly remove the head bringing a quick, humane end. If you're someone who needs an axe for this purpose than I have no doubt my assessment was not in the least bit offensive to you. I trust we're all trying to act like adults here?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I'm fairly please with this axe and in spite of the thin blade profile that can cause binding in the wood when trying to split, I think this makes an excellent camp axe. As mentioned, this is far too thin to do any serious splitting of logs but for light to medium duty or campsite duty this will certainly split small enough logs to get a good fire going. I had the Estwing E24A hatchet which is also another high quality chopping tool; however, more often than not I've had a hard time repeating accurate strikes with a hatchet. The length and shape of this axe makes accurate strikes much easier. So because of that and the fact that you can strike harder with two hands using this axe, I prefer this tool as a camp axe over a hatchet. The best thing this axe has going for it is the size and weight. If your use is to chop wood and you DON'T need a light, thin, compact axe you might get a bit better service out of a good quality axe with wider head than this one.
This one might suit heavy use for wood better.

3.0,Not the quality I expect from estwing. Seems to be made with very little quality control.
5.0,"Best medium campers axe in existence. My first one was stolen on a Canadian camping trip.
This is a replacement."
5.0,"This axe completely met my expectations for my purposes, which is as an emergency camp axe.  We are in the subduction earthquake zone and rural and need to be prepared to be self-sufficient for a lengthy period of time.  The axe is well constructed with one piece steel head and handle.  It is balanced perfectly and the rubber cover on the handle absorbs shock and vibration.  It arrived well sharpened and included a leather cover for the blade.  I was able to cut through a 6"" trunk on a hardwood tree with ease.  I have had many other Estwing tools going back to the 50's and have never been disappointed by any of them, nor have any ever broken."
3.0,Nice birdhouse. Required complete assembly  Directions were not always clear. Much larger that I imagined it would be
4.0,"I lost count of the number of screws but prepare to spend a few hours on assembly.  It was not overly difficult, but you need to like puzzles.  Now bring on the Purple Martins"
3.0,Was a monster to put together and it didn't go together well.  I wound up riveting sections together and even with that half of the bottom fell out.
2.0,This product would be excellent with self tapping screws.  This was insanely time consuming and frustrating to assemble.  I have great fingers and it would be impossible with extreme flexibility with one's digits.  Not to mention the risk of a serious sheet metal cut.  Putting this together was like an erector set!
1.0,Very very tedious to assemble. Mine did not have long enough screws. I was not able to put it together. Directions are poor.. Not specific. Sending this back for a refund! Save your money..
3.0,The instructions were terribly bad
4.0,"Assembled product looks great, but tedious to put the thing together."
4.0,"Each piece, when assembled, fit perfectly. My only complaint is that the edges of those pieces are VERY sharp, producing a few cut fingers."
4.0,The pole original order and replacement order did not contain all the parts. Bird house was fine.
1.0,"Very complicated assembly, poor quality.  Put together with very short screws, should have been a pop rivet assembly.  Perches are not scored deep enough to stay secure in their holes.  Pole is a very poor telescopic design.  I would not recommend this purchase, wish I hadn't."
5.0,nice
5.0,"PROS:
* Standard valve can be installed new or used for repair parts

CONS:
* None

I have a preexisting RainBird system with 8 zones.  It's a bit older, so the valves have been failing.  Expect lifetime to be 10-15 years on these.  I've had some fail because the rubber diaphragm went soft or tore.  I had some with a failed solenoid.

It's easier and cheaper to just buy the whole valve, and use it to replace the top half of the installed valve.

Repair is pretty simple.  Turn off the water.  Remove the 6 screws on old and new.  Move the diaphragm, spring, and top cap with solenoid over to the valve body that's leaking or shorted.  Use grease caps or waterproof splices to splice the wires in.  There is no polarity to worry about, but make sure the wire junctions are well protected.  There are plenty of videos online with more details.  It takes about 15 minutes with hand tools, or about half that if you have a powered screwdriver.  This is for the 6-screw type, not the jar-cap type.

Also, know that the 3/4"" and the 1"" valves are the same internally.  If you're repairing, either will be fine.  The only difference is the pipe attachment size."
4.0,"Fit, Form & Function.  Perfect!!"
5.0,"Great, high quality valves - typical of Rain Bird.  Work perfectly despite being more than 50 feet from my control box.  Happy, happy..."
5.0,Just what I was expecting.
5.0,Fast delivery and a new clean product!
5.0,Good product; timely shipping.
3.0,Broke it pretty early couldn't handle the PSI was pumping
2.0,"The Rain Bird operation manual is the most difficult, complicated and confusing manual I have encountered. I guess if you are a professional there is not problem but for a first time user to understand how the controller works, it is a genuine nightmare."
5.0,A well made product that does the job it is designed to do.
5.0,Works fine. Just what I wanted.
5.0,exactly as listed
5.0,"This review is being written 3/24/2015 for the Rain Bird A17SST - 4' x 30' Shrub Nozzle - Side Strip Pattern, advertised and sold on the Amazon website.

The spray pattern is more pronounced side-to-side and does not spray as advertised on the Rainbird website on their spec sheet.  The Rainbird specs show more of an even rectangular pattern, extending wide on either side and to the front of the spray head.  Instead, the spray is concentrated more side-to-side, with little coverage immediately in front of or angled in either direction off center from the head (and minimal spray behind the head which does match the Rainbird specs).  This makes the spray excellent when mounted at the rear of straight garden beds, as long as additional heads of this kind are overlapping on either side to fill in the gaps.  This is probably the design intent anyway, but it would be clearer if the spray pattern showed more of a modified square pattern vs. the solid rectangle which may be interpreted as applying even coverage of the square without additional heads to overlap the coverage."
4.0,As advertized
5.0,JUST WHAT WE WANTED.  IT'S PERFECT FOR OUR SPRINKLER SYSTEM.
4.0,I was having trouble finding one of these in the big box stores. it adjusted easily to cover an area where about 120 degree coverage was required.
5.0,"Rain bird always makes excellent quality products and have been for many years. Easy to use, easy to combine with other parts & excellent delivery. Many adjustable features for lots of spaces and uses.sprink"
3.0,None
4.0,Very nice! Work perfectly. Do make a bit of noise/hum when latched open.
4.0,Shipped on time.  Works great. Good product.
5.0,back in buisness
4.0,two thumbs up :)
5.0,Works as advertised
5.0,excellent product.
2.0,"good valve but refuses to close alot, buy the same valve but with flow control, you'll have less problems"
5.0,Just what I needed for the fix.
1.0,"Fast shipping!
Worked  perfectly"
2.0,"Assembly takes at least 3 hours.  Instructions are inadequate, so much time is wasted by trial and error assembly."
4.0,It's a job to assemble! But house is great once done.
5.0,"I am writing this review FIVE YEARS after I have set this house up in my backyard. It is definitely built to last, since its still attracting wildlife. I take it down every winter, store it, and put it back up in early spring. Breaking it and putting it up takes minutes (once assembled). We have never actually gotten any Purple Martins to set up shop, but have had many other types of birds lay eggs in here over the years. They stuff it full of sticks, have their babies, then skip town. We clean it own when we take it down, which is a bit of challenge, but not impossible. Overall, we love it."
4.0,A good bird house; poor  instructions made assembly difficult.
3.0,put together was time consuming but turned out nicely.  Metal construction was not as thick as I had anticipated.
1.0,"We purchase this birdhouse about 4 years ago for Mother's birthday because she loved Birds. All we got the starlings that built in the birdhouse. The others would come and go flying in and out but never build nests. The starlings did though, and they would hop from side to side. It was very hard to put together, and never ever saw any other birds except the starling building it so we took it down and threw it away."
1.0,"Product was purchased new, but during assembly I noticed the following, which indicate that this particular item had been returned before and was resent to fill my order.  1.  Roof panels were scratched and bent; apparent that screws had been placed and removed.  2.  Screw and nut missing.  3.  Floor panel scratched from what appears to be tool marks.  4.  Floor Panels do not fit at correct angle.  Ends are out of alignment.

Not happy with this order, since I paid a NEW product price."
1.0,"I finally got time to open the box and attempt to assemble.
Instructions are a mess.  There are many many pieces to try to figure out how to put together.  I was amazed at how many parts there were
Spent two nights outting it together, then had to take part of it apart due to incomplete instructions.
Add to this the fact that I got the useless pole with parts missing and no instruction, I will never even consider Heath Outdoor Products again."
5.0,VERY SATISFIED!!
5.0,"I have not put it up yet, but it looks sturdy enough to withstand the wind."
5.0,"Well made and much lighter than the wooden house it replaced. Rugged design mounts each ""floor"" to the pole, rather than only the bottom story. Takes a while to assemble, but worth the effort."
2.0,"As others have said: You get what you pay for I suppose. I bought the 4-story house and DEAR GOD it's a nightmare to assemble. I spent three hours this afternoon and after two significant cuts and endless frustration have the top floor and roof assembled. Tomorrow I'll move on to the lower three levels. With the increased experience gained by repeating the process four times I'm GUESSING it will take another 4-5 hours to assemble the remaining three levels: About 8 hours in all. Tedious. Frustrating. Absolutely HORRIBLE instructions. Bad drawings and photos. In short- it's a nightmare. That said, it's CHEAP! In a world where you can spend $1500 on a purple martin house I guess you really DO get what you pay for. Buyer beware. You're going to need some bandaids, LOTS and LOTS of patience, some tools and small hands with lots of dexterity. If you have all those and lack money- this could be your house."
1.0,"I just received my Martin House, unpacked it, laid all the parts out and started reading the instructions. I am not dim, these instructions are the least possible amount of effort a company could put into this. Bad schematics, 72+ parts and likely many more nuts and bolts. Re-assign the person that wrote the instructions and hand someone of average intelligence the unopened box and film it. Repeat that process while re-writing the instructions until it is simple. After reading how poor the pole is and that the house isn't Starling resistant I realized I got what I paid for, not much. I just watched a YouTube video on how to cut out the interior walls to really accommodate Purple Martins. In short, a lot of assembly required, no helpful YouTube videos and not really properly engineered for the bird, it just looks good. I am returning mine and spending more  after more research."
5.0,"easy to assemble, birds are going to love it"
5.0,"alot larger than it appears, nice product"
5.0,Great.  Thank you.
5.0,"Great for the price.  Took two of us to assemble, but we put it up and within days we had 4 pair of Martins taking up residence!  They should be back next year with their offspring."
4.0,"After 20+ years of Montana weather, the Heath martin house was looking shabby.  So after making sure there was nothing better or cheaper, we bought the same model, which now has cute perches.  It is tedious to put together, best done by two patient people over a couple of hours.  The big problem is that the instructions are terrible and illustrations are confusing.  We used the old house as a model but still had to retrace our steps.  We certainly hope that this one lasts another 20 years so we never have to put another one together."
5.0,Assembly was seriously brutal!
3.0,What a pain in the butt to put together!
2.0,"I have used 5 different sets of Rain Bird valves with good success and encountered issues on the 6th.  I have attempted to contact Rain Bird technical support, and they are impossible to reach.  No email and call in only.  They automatically disconnect you with ""heavy call volume"" and then force you to wait unreasonably long periods of time (over 20 minutes) to reach technical support - they are abusive to their customer base - I will not order from them again."
3.0,"Valves work well and reliably. However, I had 7 of 16 split on the output side from the hose barb. The split did not happen right away, but over several weeks. This is possibly my own fault, but I have a very large nursery, and have installed well over a hundred solenoids over the years, and never encountered this problem before, so it makes me suspicious Just be sure to go on the light side when attaching the male adapters and hose barbs, and stay away from metal hose barbs."
4.0,they do the trick.
3.0,"I'm using this valve to create an air cannon for arborist work.  The solenoid design is a bit iffy for this application.  For its intended purpose, I""m sure it works perfectly."
5.0,"They work well under head and I will certainly get use out of them within the next few months. My system has a bit more sediment/etc. than most, so here's to hoping I won't have to take them apart too often!"
4.0,Good valve
2.0,Doesnt work pretty good... water leak don't stop
5.0,"Just what my husband needed, came quick, works good."
5.0,THIS unit was procured to replace the twenty plus year old Rain Bird on my residential irrigation system. The entire manifold of four valves was rebuilt. Please note that prior to encapsulating (grease filled caps for water proofing) that you should test your wiring for proper polarity. I almost did not and one of the valves was incorrectly wired. This would have been messy and time consuming to correct after encapsulating the wiring. I also recommend soldering the wiring as an extra means of bullet proofing your installation. I examined the improvements in the design versus the previously installed units and found that there were several enhancements that should improve service life over the original twenty years.
5.0,Works great.
4.0,"Axe is very sturdy, handle wasn't finished properly and paint was bubbled in spots"
3.0,"Good Axe, but for a special edition, ther is not much special about it.  I had hoped the Made in America and Estwing Logo would be etched in, but they were simply stickers.  I have had the original Blue version for over a decade and it has performed admirably, this version is a little lighter and painted black, but nothing else too special about it, as reflected in the price.  Not a bad axe, just wish it was a little more special for a ""special Edition."
5.0,"Great product.  works well, and had a nice edge from factory.  Great buy"
4.0,"Perfect size, weight, and balance for a night or weekend in the woods. Will cut enough wood to keep you and your friends warm."
5.0,Nicely balanced ax.  Made in the USA to boot.  I use it for removing the roots from my trees when they grow too close to the surface and interfere with the lawn.
3.0,The blade is very thin. It keeps getting stuck in the wood.
5.0,Indestructible is the best way to describe this axe. And that is exactly what you need in a survival situation. Holds an edge all day
5.0,"Very light and very sharp.  I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this Axe for use on large trees, its more for small trees and limbs."
5.0,"Great buy, Very nice!"
5.0,"I bought this to keep in my camping trailer.  The axe was very sharp when it arrived and splits small firewood with ease.  The size of this axe is between a hand axe and a full-sized axe.  It is well made and includes a sheath for the head.  I was not careful the first time I removed the sheath and cut my hand on the blade.  Again, it was very sharp when it arrived."
3.0,Involved to assemble.  Door plugs fall out in cold or windy weather.
4.0,"I have purchased two of these houses, they were a pain in the but to assemble, you need smaller fingers than I have. But once installed they work great, my neighbor has a fancy wood one, I have three times the birds, I also have plastic gourds, the birds like the houses much better, I plan on replacing the gourds with another one of these houses, my oldest house is three years old and still looks new"
5.0,Great Bird house.  We had three sets of Purple Martins the first week we put it up.  It stood up to 40 mile an hour wind and a hail storm.
1.0,"None of the panels fit together right, Luckily I have a shear and metal break so I was able to fabricate it to fit together right."
1.0,Was the hardest thing to put together--I did not listen to the reviews and ordered it anyway--I am so sorry I bought it. It still is in the garage waiting to be put up as soon as I figure how to mount it so.
5.0,"I like this house once it was put together.  If you are not good with crafts you do not need to buy this house, has a lot of parts and was very hard to put together.  The directions are not very good.  I am not good at putting things together, if you are then this is the house for you."
5.0,"Took several hours to assemble, but once we had it together we really like it.  So do our birds."
3.0,Half of the plastic porch rails were missing. Not worth the time or money to ship it back.
4.0,"Arrived in a short time, One door was missing and had to call to have one shipped. No hassle with replacement. There was already a pole in the ground so I bought a 1 1/4 pipe like it says and the thickness caused it to be slightly larger. Ended up buying another smaller pole to get it mounted.
Now all I need is martins."
1.0,An absolute piece of junk....  AND the assembly instructions are horrendous.
4.0,Works fine.
5.0,"I am so done with orbit valves. These Rainbird valves cost a little more, but they work and they last."
5.0,Very happy. Thanks.
4.0,"This was an easy purchase.  I did not have to go to multiple hardware stores hunting down the exact units as those I have currently in service.  Purchasing these now will allow me to rebuild my existing valves without having to dig up the valve box area and rebuilding the ""manifold"".  And the price was reasonable."
4.0,Best and cheapest replacement of a Toro
5.0,no issues
5.0,"I had amazing results - well exactly what they say will happen!  My plants really did well this year since I was on top of fertilizing 1 to 2 times a week.  From my bamboo to gerber daisies, clematis, hibiscus and more. I use the garden feeder that you re-fill and I use the pre-measured pouches that are pre-measured and you just pour into the feeder and go.  It's easy to use and delivers results.

** I'll post a picture of my feeder, fertilizer box and one of my plants that's done wonderful and never stopped blooming since It's been planted.  I do water daily since it's summer but that's common sense if you want anything to survive the heat."
5.0,"Made well, works well"
2.0,"I have used these valves for years, only because no one else makes one this size straight through,BUT they constantly leak and one cannot do anything about it"
5.0,The CPO75 Rainbird sprinklern-line valves I bought were used to replace valves originally installed in my back yard system.  The new valves are even better than the original in-line valves that were installed in the system many years ago.  I'm well satisified with the product.
5.0,It's a nice lightweight axe for chopping. Mostly light work but it does the job. If you need to split wood obviously go for a splitting axe. But it's fun to swing around and chop small firewood.
4.0,"Perfect for chopping kindling, easy to sharpen.  Comfortable grip and nice leather sheath too."
5.0,"i love this one...good size, good weight. this is my ""go to..."" right now."
5.0,"Got this for kayaking. Little big as a hatchet but more leverage and a little more weight. Not ideal for splitting lots of logs but where I kayak camp it can only
Be dead wood anyways. Finish seems alright. There's a little strip of black tape around the handle just below the head of the axe. Little strange as to why they put it on there."
5.0,Did an awesome job on the roots from removing the shrugs in my front yard.
5.0,great quality and sharp cuts down trees no problem and and my hands don't get shocked to much
5.0,made in the us. awesome product.
5.0,I love it. What more can I say.
5.0,"Estwing makes a good quality Axe...in the United States of America. Lifetime warranty, great tool. Highly Recommend"
5.0,A little pricey but looks nicer than the regular stainless.
3.0,"I wish I could give this two ratings.  5 star for how it looks after it is together and one star for the directions and putting it together. They say to read all the instructions before starting, but it you don't have the experience you don't understand the directions.  After taking it apart 2-3 times the directions made more since.  I only cut myself 4 times so be very careful-which they do warn you about. We now have it up and it looks great!"
4.0,"Good quality, takes time to assemble but easy to understand.  I think cleaning it will be hard, since the roof needs to be removed and floors separated.  Overall, good value."
5.0,Loved it
2.0,"Not as bad as the pole they sell for this bird house, but I would also avoid the bird house.  Its not hard to put together, but the directions are really poor which causes extra time and delay.

The plastic little sticks they provide for the birds to perch are not designed well to work with the aluminum floor - you end up bending the aluminum to get them to go in, and then the perch won't stay in place.

The plastic connector for the pole is also a poor design..  Metal screw going through plastic to hook too a metal pipe....the screw strips out the plastic"
3.0,"Ok,but, instructions and parts NOT exact fit."
1.0,Assembly is a nightmare!!!!!
3.0,This is the most difficult bird house to put together. It took us so long to put them together we missed this season. I would not recommend them to anyone. Because I shake I literally had to pay some one to put them together. There are little tiny screws everywhere. One birdhouse has not been opened and it will be returned. My hands are too large to get into the tiny spaces. These are well made they are just too difficult to put together.
1.0,"Requires about 4 hours of assembly and parts are extremely sharp (very thin metal).  The instructions are poor. I saw this in the other comments and thought I could handle that; trust them, the instructions are poor, parts are very sharp, and it takes several hours to assemble this house.  I actually bought a second setup and had it shipped to my mom.  I immediately had it returned un-opened.  Not a gift for an elderly person.  I did finally get it together. A couple of the plastic rails just outside the holes would not stay in place, I had to glue them.  The plastic pole retention collars deform when the setscrews are tightened, so you cannot apply much load to hold the house to the pole.  Time will tell if the assembly stays on top the pole, I have my doubts. I do not recommend this item and would not (did not) buy another.  Hope this helps."
5.0,Haven't got it together yet. Had to ask a friend I shake too badly to be able to use a screw driver. Can't wait to see all of them up.
1.0,"We were very disappointed  with both houses we purchased! First it is very sharp and damages ( bends)  easily when putting together. (very deceiving from the pictures!) After we got different screws to affix the top on we realized that to clean the nests out the front portion of house doesn't open . You have to take the bottoms out of slots to accomplish this( if that infact will work without tearing the whole house apart!) i would not recomend this product, but would encourage to look for houses that are able to be clean without all this trouble. I could have spent my 300+ dollars better. The poles were not so bad."
4.0,"Good!
So far so good. The first results are in good order. But, this kind of device need to have more time working to have better idea about the quality."
1.0,"I can't comment on the performance, as it split when I was screwing onto the pipe.  I was applying a moderate amount of force- no more than used with comparable valves that I've used for the same application from Hunter or Orbit, and it split before I even thought it was close to being tight."
2.0,"I've had five of these working for about five years. A year ago 3 of them developed minor leaks when turned on. I ordered new internal diaphrams but they did not fix the leaks. I called RainBird and the guy was unable to solve the problem. I am now trying a waterproof sealing compound in hopes that it will stop the leak.

The RainBird guy suggested a pro look at them, but one visit like that would cost more than replacing the valves. If I can't stop these leaks I will buy another brand/model. Other solenoid valves I have used have lasted much longer without this problem."
5.0,"Valve is sturdy, quite  has no leaks and good flow.  What more do you want for around $15?  It is installed in a geothermal heat pump application."
5.0,"Yes, it's a valve. If you're buying an inline sprinkler valve on Amazon you most likely are somewhat knowledgable about them. I mean heck... you could have just gone to HD or Lowe's or something. This valve worked like a charm. In order to avoid cutting out the old valve body I cheated and replaced the top portion from this valve on my malfunctioning one (it was either a bad solenoid or diaphragm this way I replaced both cheaper). Luckily my shortcut worked and I'm back in business."
5.0,I have to replace these on a regular basis due to sub- freezing temperatures in the winter where I live. I do insulate the valves but mother nature still wins out sometimes. Have found Rain Bird to be a high quality valve that work a long time if nature doesn't interfere.
5.0,The rain bird is a great product that lasts. It could not be any easier to install and service. Recommended!
5.0,"Been using these for a while.  Replacing some of its competition.  Work faster, easier to manually open.  Compact yet good flow."
3.0,My sprinkler system is getting  old and  originally used this specific valve. I was surprised that this valve was still available so bought a spare while I had the chance. They have been a very reliable valve with few if ever a problem.
4.0,"It appears that after my unusually long shipping , I waited for a dissatisfying product, when manually operating this device, it leaks to no end. Will not purchase any more of these Birds."
5.0,"I am about to put up a fence and need to dig 35-40 three foot deep holes for the 4x4s. I have a regular clam shell type post hole digger, however I wanted the holes to be precisely 8 inches in diameter to minimize the amount of concrete and disturbed earth. This ruled out the regular post hole digger. The fact that I plan to put up this fence over a month or two ruled out renting a Gasoline Auger.

While looking through Amazon I spotted this Auger. I had never seen an Auger like this before, but after reading several reviews I decided to give it a shot as it was a very cost efficient potential solution to my needs.

As it was late when I got home I took it out and gave it a few turns in a bare spot in my back yard and was amazed how quickly it cut into the ground. The next day when I had more time I wanted to see how long it would take to dig a hole to my target depth of three feet. I marked the shaft in 1 foot increments for a depth guage and got started. In the south Alabama red clay dirt it took about 10-15 minutes to dig a near perfect 8"" wide, 3 foot deep hole. I did not run into any rocks, so I cannot say how it would handle them.

The only easier way to get a hole that perfect and deep would be to buy or rent a Gasoline Auger, which for a one day rental would cost as much as buying this one."
5.0,"Great item.  Worked very well digging post holes in clay.  Fast digging and the dirt comes out easier than I thought it would.  It's a lot easier to use than a conventional post hole digger.  If you're digging deep holes there's some bending, but if that's a problem you can screw a short  piece of 3/4 inch pipe and a collar between the handle and the digger head.  It's well made, sturdy, and makes the job easier.  All tools should be this good.  And it's made in America."
4.0,Had looked for one of these for some time so much easier than reg post digger. Already earned its keep! a little tough when trying to dig in rocky soil but still well worth it.
5.0,It drives a much cleaner hole in the ground than my regular clamshell digger. Plus it does a better job of lifting the dirt out of the hole.
5.0,"I recommend this auger over non-adjustable types. It can be adjusted between 6"", 7"" and 8"" diameter holes. You never want a wider hole than necessary, as it filling it in (especially with concrete) is a lot more work with bigger holes (remember, the volume to be filled grows with the SQUARE of the growth in the diameter -- radius, actually). Also, if you are setting posts in bare ground, the smaller hole leaves the post closer to undisturbed earth, which is stronger than the dirt you fill and tamp in.

But sometimes you need bigger holes (bigger posts or heavier footings).

What do you want to do, own more than one auger? Get this one and effectively have three.

I wish it was adjustable to even wider and narrower diameters.

Let me say this in general about augers -- I can see no reason why anyone would prefer the ""clamshell"" post hole digger to an auger. The auger works much better (especially as the hole gets deeper) and it's a lot easier, too. The big-box home improvement shops only seem to stock the clamshells, though."
5.0,Sturdy and well-built.  Highly recommended.
5.0,If you want an ax that will last till they bury you this is the one. It chops like a dream and so sharp you have to be careful. It's all steel construction so no replacing a handle.
5.0,"Bought this axe after reading a review on axes in a homesteading magazine.  Its a pleasure to work with; balanced and sharp.  I advise everyone to use caution as this axe is sharper out of the package than any axe I have ever worked with.  But perhaps I should have sharpened my axes more, this one makes my tasks easier."
5.0,good axe to have around the house and in the yard. very handy for chopping dead limbs and dead trees
5.0,"Great ergonomics, axe head is narrow allowing penetration, then widens to help with splitting. Nice sheath included. Best of all it's made in the USA, not some cheap foreign copy of an axe. Quality item."
5.0,"Solid head and handle unlike many of the others on the market. This ensures the head does not loosen, tang break or have wood chips embed themselves between.  Major flaw of the Gerber variant.  Arrives very sharp and ready for use."
5.0,"Exactly what I expected from and Estwing tool, well built. I own several different Estwing hand tools, some close to 50 years old and still going well and I expect the same from this axe.

The axe is very sharp when it arrives and I have split a lot of wood already and it is still sharp.

I would highly reccomend."
5.0,"I was looking for a camping/hunting  axe and these thing meet every expectation I hoped for it cuts through small trees and small game like its butter. was really pleased. mine came factory sharp then I hit with a wet stone, this baby is ready for about anything"
3.0,this is a great item until you get to the blue part of the handle. the blue part is hollow and slid onto the solid well built top end.  i have not used it but i could see it pulling off if abused. however if you welded a steel pipe in place of the blue it may last forever. it came sharp.
5.0,Meets and exceeds my my expectations. It will tackle bigger logs than I thought it would. Awesome for you camping needs.
1.0,"My husband builds airplans, said this was a bunch of junk,directions where no good . Would mot avise any one to buy. Beware."
3.0,"Directions were hard to understand or didn't match what was next. There was a gillion small nuts and bolts and every single one was hard to install. The plastic that was supposed to go over the pole were tapered. A pole that would go through the hole was too loose. I ended up using a hole saw and drilled the taper out. It took close to 7 hours of steady working to put this together. Numerous times, I had to undo something as the directions were not clear as to what was next. It is now up and looks nice, but I'll never buy another that I have to put together like this."
3.0,"It's just OK, don't think it will hold up well."
1.0,I ordered this product three times and each time major parts were missing.  After the third order/exchange I gave this one star because that was the lowest rating I could give.  This would have been a nice birdhouse all parts would have been included.
1.0,"Parts don't match up, and Instructions Suck!"
5.0,Hard to assemble but nice.
2.0,"Product white rails fall out very easily.
Each session (floor level, this unit has three)  do not connect together, gap between floors and are not secured.
The product description does not state the correct mounting poll
The suggested products which also gets purchased at the same time stated a mounting platform BP-15. I purchased it only to find out it does not work with this product.
Be ready to work hours to set up."
5.0,Well made but complicated and timely to put together.
5.0,I really like this bird house.  It was easy to put together.  I did put super glue around the pegs where the perches fit.  Some of them didn't fit real tight.
5.0,"My second one, the birds came, so I bought another.  A bit tedious to put together, but all part fit nicely."
5.0,"Brand new product that works as expected without problems, landscape look great with this automatic watering system, very happy with Rain Bird products."
5.0,"what else can you say. Have used these in the past and they are so easy to install and they just work.  Tried the battery types, but they seem so much more of a pain, then doing it right"
5.0,"I've been using Orbit control valves for my drip system and every year they change a solenoid or other feature so they can't be repaired by interchanging simple parts...and they leak!  I was told by my son-in-law in the landscaping business to use Rain Bird valves but they weren't available locally. I finally broke down and got rid of all the Orbit valves and couldn't be happier. The Rainbird valves are a simple design, don't take as much room in the valve box and are working flawlessly. We'll see how they work out after I take them out for the winter and reinstall them next spring, but for now I don't worry about valve failure while being gone a week or two at a time."
5.0,"I've had a system of six valves set up to water my lawn for about thirty years.  The Original installation was done with Orbit valves and they have worked well ---but eventually as they began to fail I've replaced them now with rainbirds which also work well.  I have not had the rainbirds nearly as long as the Orbits so I can't compare them for longevity.  I think both are good but I now favor the rainbirds which seem to be of a simpler construction---and I'm thinking ""simpler is better"". ????/"
5.0,"My previous CP075 failed after 12 years, so I was happy to see they still made the same model for an easy replacement"
4.0,The sprinkler control valve works exactly as I wanted. The only negative point for me is the 1-inch NPT threads. I would have preferred garden hose barbs. A trip to the hardware store got the fittings I need. It would be nice to not need to make that trip.
3.0,"I needed a electric valve to control the flow of margaritas, while this will work perfectly for fluids its not designed for anything other than fluids.  Wouldn't let margaritas flow thru it.  Will keep it and setup an additional dispenser of tequila for those wanting to improve their margarita kick."
5.0,IT was simple to install and works great.  no issues in 6mos of use so far.  It was buried in dirt wrapped in Styrofoam.
5.0,i use it to make potato/carrot cannons it works great. it held about 115psi of air which is impressive they worked great every time.
1.0,"The valve was working ok for a year, and this week a crack happened in the written part of the connection PVC pipe and sent water everywhere. I have it installed to control the water of the jacuzzi in an apartment building, and my neighbors got their apartment flooded big time. I'm still working on the damage cost, but I already have over $5000 in bill to pay because of the damage. Next time I will buy a honeywell metal valve."
3.0,hard to assemble
2.0,"I would not buy this again.  It comes in a gazillion different thin metal, sharp edged pieces that you must assemble.  Frustrating and dangerous!"
5.0,Amazing product for the purple martins
3.0,Not nearly as sturdy as the old birdhouse we had for so many years.  It was a rectangle.
1.0,"I would have elected 0 stars if it would let me. Overall, this is a cheaply constructed item. Upon assembly, poor fit became evident. The plastic perch pieces will easily pop out. The v-shaped flat metal banding material used to hold the center hole top cover piece via tension quickly corroded allowing the top cover piece to blow off leaving a gaping hole. I DO NOT recommend this product"
4.0,We like the birdhouse very much especially the fact that it was made in the USA!!!!
5.0,Very nice!!
4.0,Hard to put together.
5.0,"GOOD HOME FOR THE BIRDS, TAKES ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO ASSEMBLE EACH LAYER.  LOTS OF NUTS AND BOLTS."
4.0,Instructions provided with the product were very poor. Shipping was fast.
5.0,This thing is awesome  sharp and sturdy... Its worth every penny.. It has been used once and chopped through a few fallen branches better than expected.. It is easy to swing and fits the hands well... It is very sharp and well balanced.. I HIGHLY recommend this. Axe
5.0,Haven't bing camping yet but used this little ax worked great cut up branches in the yard. Looking forward to camping and hunting great ax  Tell you more later after camping.
5.0,"Perfect axe for household chores requiring a tool like this. Axe is balanced beautifully. Lightweight and easy to use, even for a woman."
5.0,"I used this axe to cut few small trees and to clean some branches. It is sharp and it was easy to work with it.

Please note that this axe is not good for splitting woods, because it is not thick and heavy enough. However so far it is doing very good job with the cutting."
5.0,"Excellent tool, well made and easy to handle.  I especially like the metal handle, no wooden one to rot or become loose.  I have used the hammer for years and am so glad to find this axe at a reasonable price.  I certainly recommend it!"
5.0,I purchased this product for the purposes of camping and keeping in the back of my SUV. In both of these roles the product has performed extraordinarily. It is the perfect size for delivering power while still being easy to wield or store in the car. A great tool for preparing firewood or building an impromptu shelter. It also came in handy when clearing a fallen tree from the road following a severe thunderstorm.
5.0,"This is a very nice axe. It's not meant for big jobs, although, it will tackle small trees and even larger jobs with a little extra elbow grease. This is a great camp axe, the longer handle gives you more leverage than the shorter one, but the weight of the axe is good for tying it to your back pack without adding to much extra weight. It was sharp when I got it and a simple file will keep it sharp noting that an axe does not need the edge of a knife, it is for chopping wood, not field dressing game."
5.0,"This axe is as smart as the hatchet I had 40 years ago in boy scouts. Nice balance, perfect size, light weight and sharp! Estwing does a great job with the finish too, and all at a very reasonable price."
5.0,"I have had many friends compliment me on the purchase of this Axe, they even have tried to buy it from me.  I told them where to buy it and a couple of them have bought one.  Light weight and just the right size for what I need it for, splitting small pieces of wood to it in my wood burning stove.  I do not use it to split large logs, I have a larger and heavier axe for that.  This is a very useful piece of equipment for what I use it for."
5.0,"This is the Bruce Lee of ax's. Fast, Lightweight, and sharp. Why people gave this wonderful tool one star I will never understand. It withstood a field test by 2 days chopping rounds of Michigan hardwoods. Aced through riding on my B.o. B. And left me shocked after digging through frozen rocky dirt only to beg for more and have many other uses around a camp site in the middle of Febuary. I still have yet to chip or even need to sharpen the blade on this beast. Only small issue is it has difficultings splitting anything over 6in in diameter. If you don't own this ax, you've wasting your money."
5.0,The Rain Bird sprinkler valve seems to work better than the Orbit valves I started having problems with.
1.0,Check them before you install them.  I bought 5 of these for my sprinkler project.  3 had cracked solenoids (at the base of the solenoid on the threads) and one had a bad valve.  I don't know if I just got a bad lot but 1 out of 5 is ridiculous.
4.0,"Wanted to let everyone know the answer to the question that I had:  Is this 3/4 inch PVC connection threaded on this unit or slip on?  The answer is that it is threaded.  This makes it really convenient to install and in case of need to flush/replace for some reason, less work to remove just this valve instead of cutting the manifold etc. etc.

I have had it installed and working for about a year now.  I have three valves, connected to a mainfold, laying on a bed of gravel, and covered with an upside down cement mixing tray which does a good job of keeping the water out.  Went through a DC winter and still looks new and works.  No complaints."
5.0,Instale en mi jardin con un temporizador digital pues resulto muy bueno funciona a la perfeccin es un buen precio que se pago por el aparato
5.0,"I've been asked to review this item, and so here is what I think.

It is a valve that opens and closes, it is actuated by a 24v current flowing from the control panel.
As far as I can tell, it does what it's supposed to.

They are inexpensive, durable, and work as advertised.

While I'm here...

I'd like to say that Amazon has done a great job in building this website. It is convenient, has a large selection, and in most cases competitively priced. However, if they begin collecting NJ sales tax, I will no longer purchase big ticket items with Amazon."
4.0,Bought this to repair an existing one I had.. Top has changed a little bit but all the pieces attached to the old base .. Saved me from detaching the base from water lines..
5.0,"The Rain Bird can be modded to use a tennis ball launcher ""trigger"" valve in a device that kinda looks like a well a tennis ball launcher...LOL
There are directions on the net if you are so inclined. This valve is absolutely essential IMHO, to building & using the launcher.

Not normally a ""5"" ""giver"" but this does what we wanted, very well!!!"
5.0,"Great product. I used this valve for my tennis ball launcher. (potato cannon) If you drill it out and tap the bleeder screw and replace it with a blow gun tip, you can launch stuff pretty far. It'll hold 120 psi easily with minimal air leakage. Very durable. I bought and used 3 for different guns so far."
5.0,"I only used this valve for half a season, and so far it has been working reliably. I have purchased other Rain Bird valves in the past and have always had good experiences with them."
4.0,I have used this for my t-shirt cannon and it worked OK. First time I used it I had to disassemble it and put it back together because it was leaking (air) but after that it worked well holding 70 psi with no problem.
4.0,"Great bird house, a little difficult to assemble but worth it!"
4.0,"Went together fairly quickly.  Some of the nuts and bolts were hard to place but with a magnet screwdriver that problem was solved.  Sides are very sharp and while I didn't get cut, it would be easy to slice into a finger or hand."
4.0,Not easy to put together and can cut your hands very easily with the sharp edges. You need to follow the directions very closely and make sure all parts are included I did not do this and had to redo some of the assembly but after assembly was completed it serves the purpose
1.0,"I have received the above purple martin house noted above. When opened, significant parts were missing including all of the necessary bolts etc. to put the unit together. Other major items also were missing. I am trying to contact the seller by phone, but so far have not been successful. Clearly the items which should have been in place from the manufacturer (Health Outdoor Products) were not put in originally. Interestingly, when looking at a pole for the house and perusing the various reviews, it was also noted that the same manufacturer of a similar product had left out items from that product also. It appears that their quality assurance program is not adequate. I would strongly recommend checking packaging asap when arriving to confirm all is present. Quite frustrated."
4.0,This was is a cut purple martin birdhouse. There is a lot of assembly to it and my husband complained about that. Otherwise it is a good buy I think.
1.0,"The directions are poorly written so once you figure out how to assemble it be prepared to spend several hours putting it together.  Have your fine motor skills honed as this will be necessary to get into tight spaces to attach  the nuts and bolts.  Warning the pieces are sharp, so have your first aid kit handy.  The individual floors aren't connected but sit on top of one another.  The plastic perches snape into holes in the floor pieces.  The problem is they don't stay in the holes but easily fall out. I would ship this back but I don't want to waste any more time disassembling it."
4.0,"It comes in a lot of pieces to put together.  However, once it is together it is very nice. I did not put on the perching bars because they are kind of cheap and I felt that the 1st wind storm would have them all over my yard."
3.0,"We need instructions for assembling this house.  Just got the parts, no pole, etc.  Can anyone offer some simple instructions?"
4.0,Well made from aluminum...took a while to put together but.  . .I expect this to last a long time.....nice looking  too
4.0,"I ordered my purple martin condo  just after their migration season.
I missed the martin scouts by about a month early april in NY.
However it looks awesome
I only put 1 tier up on the pole saving the other 2 in case I need them in the future.
If you are planning on putting one up research
their migration schedule to have the house ready"
5.0,"Arrived in great shape - as advertised and in good condition. Would recommend this anyone wanting a Martin home.
Thanks"
1.0,"the house looked perfect and seemed to be just what i wanted, however when it arrived, we spent 2 hours trying to put it together and couldn't.  it would have taken another 4 hours at least to attempt to get it together completely.  in the meantime, my poor martins (have been coming for 12 years) were desperate for their house.  so then i tried to return it only to find out i was no longer able to do so.  i am beyond frustrated.  now i guess i will have to hire an architect to put it together for me!!"
2.0,"Poor quality.  I have seen so many of this style around, I thought it would be good.  Maybe it is just this manufacturer.  The package contained two sets of screws that were different, so half way through assembly I had to switch from a phillips head screwdriver to a regular blade screwdriver.  I would have ranked this ""I HATE IT"" if I hand not noticed the different type of head on the same screws and dumped them together before installing.  The instructions were poor and I would have installed it in a slightly different order to make it easier, especially since I had to use two different screwdrivers to secure and tighten the screws.  The perches are a joke, you bend the flimsy aluminum floor trying to secure the perches (Instructions are good to warn you about this, but there is no way around it), and I have already had three fall off.  I am expecting more to fall of in the Kansas wind.  Finally, the plastic plugs for the entry holes do not fit tight and of course they fell out before I was ready to open the house up for the martins and had sparrows building nests.  And guess what, it is a nightmare to clean out those sparrow nests on this design...be carefule or you will bend the flimsy aluminum!!!  I would recommend purchasing something with a little more quality if you want it to last."
5.0,"I have had this exact birdhouse for 12 years and am very happy with it but a very high snow storm this winter bent the pole over and then the house crashed to the ground.  When I ordered a new pole, I decided to order a new house to the one that took the tumble.

As everyone else stated, this takes a few hours to assemble because of the nut/bolt assembly system.  It comes knocked down as a series of panels.  They fit together very well and as long as you follow the instructions, it goes smoothly.  If you are impatient and clumsy, don't get this item as it will make you a blood donor with the many exposed sharp edges during assembly.  Once together, it's a very solid and well made item.

My first martin house is still in fairly good shape, though the finial is gone.  We have a large property and open field in a wet area where bugs abound, so the martins just love this area and you can watch them swooping over the field for hours gulping up bugs.  When I mow the field, the martins are in a non-stop dive bomb at my tractor because I kick up so many bugs it's like an all you can eat free for all for the birds.

Patience is a virtue in assembly.  The end product will make the investment of a few hours well worth it, but it does take time so don't plan on knocking this down in an hour unless you've assembled hundreds of these before.  The nuts and bolts are tiny and the assembly is awkward to handle while putting it all together.

This will last well over ten years and the only threat to it's longevity is wind and something falling on it."
3.0,"We purchased this to replace an old one.  Put it up, wear gloves or you will get all kinds of cuts.  Still not sure if birds will be okay since we got alots of cuts from the sharp edges.  Mild wind came by and blew off some of the plastic roosting bars and the very top peak.  Not really sturdy."
5.0,"GREAT SERVICE. GREAT PRODUCT WITH ABUNDANT SCREWS AND PARTS TO PUT THE HOUSRE TOGETHER,  DETAILED TIME CONSUMING PROJECT TO SAY THE LEAST, BUT WORTH IT IN THE END."
4.0,"These are good houses. One tip. I glued the 6 roof pieces together with Gorilla super glue and clamps. This allowed me to thread the screws through the holes to bolt the now one piece roof easily to the top story. There are some complaints about the thin metal. Will the house last many years? Yes! The Mobile,Al. Audubon Society placed 8 of these houses on poles in Moblle Bay at the Fairhope ,AL.park in 2001. They are left up year round, and are subjected to high winds, and constant salt spray. They are still in service today 13 years later! Would you rather pay $ 125.00 for this house, or pay $ 550.00 for the Nature House Castle Which is the same size ? The Nature House Castle is much better built, with heaver aluminum, but is it worth $550.00 ?"
5.0,"As many have mentioned, the instructions stink.

When you build it, build the top level first, and then the bottom level exactly like it (minus the roof),  Once the two parts are together, slide the lower level on the pole first, about two feet down, then mount the top piece on the pole.  Once the top piece is secured to the pole with the tension bolt, slide the lower level up to it tightly, and put the side walls of the lower unit inside the floor of the upper level, then tighten the bottom tension bolt.

Viola!!

Like others said, use some spray glue or such on the bottom of the railings before pushing them in the floor.  If you don't they will pop out relatively easy.

Enjoy your Martins!!  Ours were circling the house as I was pushing up the pole!!  Must have like the curb appeal!!!"
3.0,"The house is great once it's complete, but a bit unwieldy to assemble. I recommend gluing the perches in, rather than just pressing them into the metal, as strong winds can remove them. Use non toxic glue."
5.0,"We love our Purple Martin house and so do the birds! I would have never been able to assemble all of the pieces, but my husband is very good with things like this. It did take him awhile to assembe, but we really do like the house."
5.0,"Really nice Axe, quality material, easy to use, stays sharp. Husband is working on his to do list now, wish I had bought one sooner!"
5.0,"It's Estwing, what can I say?
HIGH Quality.
Excellent grip.  ""Hammer"" type rubberized lower grip area.
About 30"" long I guess.
VERY nice leather holster/cover which I treated with Neatsfoot Oil."
5.0,This is a great light weight sharp out of the box camping axe !!  Solid handle ! Nice little axe !!
5.0,"gonna cut down small trees with it, little smaller than expected so make sure you look at the sizes carefully before ordering."
5.0,Arrived on time and in excellent shape. It is a nice size for all around chores. My husband likes the longer handle. It is just a handy little ax.
5.0,My husband bought thus for camping and hiking. The blade is sharp and the handle is strong. Hopefully this will last for a long time.
5.0,"I have been extremely impressed with this axe for its build quality. It is the perfect size for carrying around my property and doing maintenance or throwing in the back of the car, and the shock reduction grip works surprisingly well.

I will say, this is not a splitting axe. This axe is more for basic maintenance/camp work, and possibly for felling smaller trees. It is too narrow to really use for felling large trees."
5.0,"This this is sharp as heck out of the box, with a nice thin-profile blade that makes chopping easy.  I had to remove a broken oak on my property about 8"" in diameter, this thing took care of it in 30 seconds.  Size/weight is perfect for any type of camping where weight is less of a concern than backpacking.  Great for canoe camping, car camping, medium hiking, etc."
5.0,Theses are perfect size and. Weight for camping great for use on river in canoe  best quality out there very use full
5.0,"the axe was for the grandson also , he asked for it so he could help his dad cut firewood and camping ."
5.0,If you need to manually dig postholes this is the best tool to purchase.  Digs like a prairie dog going after supper.  Even in caliche clay.  Highly recommended.
3.0,Did not work for me they way the ad claimed. Tried to send back but they refused.
5.0,"Works how it should. Very easy, can't complain."
5.0,Four years since the purchase still digs strong.  What an improvement over standard scissor type.  I would say at least twice as fast to dig holes.
5.0,Love it.  Put an extension iron pipe on it and bored a 6 ft hole through gravel and clay.
5.0,"Out of the box dug 12 3ft post holes in 30 min! Rocky top soil, Rooty middle, Clay deep all soft as butter to this tool. This tool is incredible."
5.0,"This thing makes digging hole for posts effortless.  As long as your soil is not too dry and sandy, you can easily dig perfectly round post holes in much less time with much less pains than the traditional post digger.  The price is high but worth the cost.  We only need to dig 4 holes for the post of our pergola, but this can be used later for our fence posts too.  We got the 8"" opening, and this is adjustable too. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Works just like all the reviews claim. I used it to dig 8 post holes for in heavy clay soil, about 42"" deep. I used the widest setting (for 8"" holes). The holes turned out perfectly, and the going was quite easy. Only thick roots and large rocks caused some trouble - the roots had to be avoided or cut down with a digging bar and the rocks pulled out by hand. I didn't attach the handle with the supplied screw, and that made it possible to dig a hole very close to the wall by doing half turns with the handle partially inserted."
5.0,This makes the clamdigger type seem ancient.  I had a hole 4' deep in my hard as rock clay soil in no time
5.0,"Just tried, post hole digging. Just fine.."
3.0,"Bought 3 houses, but after putting the first one together, we decided to send the other two back and get one's a bit more user friendly.  Decided to try it again with the 2nd house, and after another 3 hours, decided to send the 3rd back.  Half of the railing were missing on the 3rd house, which clinched the decision to go with another type.  If you have average sized hands, this is not for you.  Too many small nuts, bolts and tiny places to erect easily"
1.0,"This item comes completely disassembled.  There are 60 or so parts and maybe 100 or more screws and bolts.
The edges of the parts are very sharp - I cut my hands more than once. The directions are poor and hard to follow.
The time required to get it assembled is excessive. If I had known I would not have gotten the thing. In the end it looked
O.K. but the light material makes me think that it may not last very long. If I had known I would not have bought it.
The Ad doesn't mention assembly,"
4.0,A very nice looking martin house but it took my husband two nights to put it together.  It has many parts and he had to really work to get it assembled.  We are waiting for the martins to arrive.
4.0,Once I finally got this put together it is a very nice quality Martin House.  We have had some very high winds and this thing held up.  You need little tiny money hands and fingers and a lot of patience to assemble this thing though.
3.0,It is very time consuming to assemble and even when instructions are followed to the letter it does not come out looking very good.  They floor panels do not end up being smooth around the perimeter.
2.0,"The finished product is fine, but it is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming to assemble. The directions were not good either."
5.0,"Easy to put together.  What my wife wanted.  A lot of screws, but one screw driver and a wrench and you are done."
5.0,"This is the second Purple Martin house we have purchased.
Its a great bird house and my husband had no problem putting it together."
1.0,"Oh my gosh, this thing is a NIGHTMARE to put together.  The instructions are horrible.  Some parts have to be screwed together where your hands can barely fit.  We are hours into it and only have it 1/3 assembled.  Never again!"
3.0,"Took us a long time just to put the roof together. The screws need to be longer. So far we have only managed to get the roof done!. Hope the rest goes a little better! We are going to put epoxy to hold the rails in place. Someone suggested that  it really helps.
My Husband and I are both Seniors and it is awkward if your hands don't work as well as they used to.
It looks really nice and I wished I had noticed that we needed the pole. We will probably just buy one from our local store.

Got it put together and it looks great! Haven't seen any martins yet but hopefully next year!"
5.0,estwing makes great products and this is an example of the company name. works amazing and the thinner cutting edge provides a better cut than other axes.
3.0,The description of this long handle axe does not state that it comes w/ a sheath so we orderd one. We had to send it back...time consuming and cost us the return postage.  The description of the short handle version states that it comes w/ a sheath.  We almost bought the short handle for that very reason...would have worked and was more cost efficient since it included the sheath..but the hubby decided he wanted the long handle version and we decided we would just purchase the sheath.  OH WELL!!! There also appears to be an asthetic flaw in the metal of the axe blade but we don't want to bother w/ returning it for that reason...tooooo much bother and shipping would be even more costly than the sheath. Thinking the axe itself will serve the purpose of chopping camp wood etc so in that respect we are satisfied!
3.0,okay for backup ax chops okay but not the ax for splitting concerned about handle if grip fails ax becomes severely compromised
5.0,Best Axe Ever. I went camping and used this to chop some food and clear the area. Als used the back blunted side to drive in tent steaks.
5.0,To start with I would call this a very small axe or a very large hatchet. It is light and can actually be hung comfortably on the belt. It is light enough that you can use it one handed to cut small branches. This is not the axe I would grab if I were going to fell a full grown oak but it would be great to have around the camp site. What I use it for is clearing branches and small trees out of atv trails and it is nice because hanging on my belt I can still ride the atv unimpeded.
5.0,"If you are looking for a great axe, this is it.  I had used it professionally before blazing property lines and it did a good job there, but today used it to put face cuts in hardwood trees and wow.  The head is ""light"" but that is what you want, easier to chop where you aim, and put some real speed into the swing.  The handle is steel and doesn't beat up the user with it's blue grip.

But, you will need a file or a stone, it was shipped pretty dull."
5.0,"This is one bad ax ax ! As tough as they get, very well-made. A must-have for outdoorsman and campers alike."
5.0,"Estwing is still living up to its name.  I must say it's about as good of an axe as I've seen for it's size, weight, and cost."
5.0,"I have been looking for a rugged axe for a long while.  My friend brought one of these last time we went camping, and after two swings I was sold.  He didn't like that I stole his axe, so after the fisticuffs were over I decided to buy my own.  Now I can chop my own wood, and we are ready for a duel."
5.0,"Does the job. If I were some kind of axe enthusiast, maybe I could come up with some reason to love or hate it. I've chopped through a seasoned and dried red oak that was across a trail. I'd love it even more if it would swing itself."
5.0,Rugged well built tool that will last for years to come. No complaints
5.0,Works awesome
5.0,I borrowed one and its the best for hole digging.  so I bought this adjustable one and there is nothing better unless u hire someone to dig the hole for you.
5.0,This is a great purchase you can adjust it for size of hole great quality
5.0,"Fantastic tool.  Really takes the effort out of the job.  Fast & easy.  This short (not even 4'10"") old lady found this tool a pleasure to use!  MUCH better than my post hole digger."
5.0,Great way to dig holes.  Faster than the lame clamshell post hole diggers.  I adjust it easily to make three different size holes.  Solid construction and really works great.
5.0,This seems like a quality product and works great.  It's more effective than a regular post hole digger.
5.0,"Makes digging small holes a breeze. Seems to be well made, sturdy."
5.0,"This auger works perfect.  We needed it to dig smaller than the typical 4x4 post size  and much deeper than a standard post hole digger would - to erect two 15 ft. tall bat houses.  They are on steel pipes sunk over 5 ft. in the ground.  Easy one person use, with little effort  depending on the soil  were in mid-west Florida with brown clay to dig thru. No issues we would purchase this again."
5.0,"Incredibly easy to use. I am not even going to bother trying to compare to a gasoline auger, who needs one? Unless you're a pro who drills many holes every day, this thing does a great job, takes only one person, and is easy to use. The only part that wasn't a snap was clearing fist sized rocks, but I understand all augers have this problem. Sometimes the new power tools are better- but I think this is a case where the old way is still a really good way.

I have heavy clay-type soil that normally requires a pickaxe or mattock to dig through. But for planting, I wish I'd had this from the start. Forget about pickaxes, shovels, or anything else, this is a one-stop planting machine, at least for root balls around 6"" or less. For large root balls, I'm even wondering if you could swiss-cheese the planting site faster than you could dig it.

Only negative is I really would have liked a 10"" adjustment. I would have happily taken a fixed 10"", but this adjustable one is a far better deal."
4.0,"This bird house is very hard to put together. It took my husband seven hours and he is a builder!!!

Anita"
5.0,Nice house...larger than I thought. Many screws that could have been a little longer. Will wait to see how it is in the wind.
2.0,"its a big martin house,but very complecated to put together, instructions could have been better, took my husband 4 days to put together, and he is very handy"
4.0,"When finally together, I was very happy with this, and so was the recipient. Was somewhat trying to get together by myself."
1.0,wont last one year - I can't believe they were so low quality - not  worth the money - never again
4.0,I purchased 2 of these houses about 5 years ago. I had no problem with the assembly. It wasn't as easy as the square alum houses but still wasn't bad. I take these down and clean and store them during the winter. The only problem I have with these houses is that the rails to hold the baby martins in keep falling off and getting loose. I have fixed that problem and replaced a lot of them with wooden railing with screws. I also have a large wooden house and I know it's much cooler than the metal houses. Both are fine. Wooden houses are more subject to disease and lice unless it's built out of cedar.
4.0,"I love this birdhouse and so does the martin birds.  My old one I had for years  and left outside always was destroyed by high winds one summer.  I would of gave it 5 stars but, it was missing screw (I bought from the warehouse)."
3.0,Lots of assembly required. We needed to purchase a rod to put through the center of the birdhouse so we could attach it to our existing pole in the back yard. After we got it up it looked great and we will enjoy it!
4.0,"This good looking birdhouse has been made for years.  I bought my first one because of that fact.  It should last for years, but time will tell.  It takes a round support which is easier to find and cheaper than trying to find a triangle shaped pole.  The only problem is the construction of the house.  The buyer must put the house together with nuts and bolts.  If you are not handy with a screwdriver and pliers, don't buy this unit.  Buy the Heath plastic Martin House.  I now have one of each."
2.0,Difficult to put together.  I regret purchasing it.  I think sparrows are living in it now and I'm going to take it down next year.  It was also missing the finial (the top piece.)
5.0,"Why did I not know about this thing before??

This simple device is NUTS! It has been phenomenal to use. It is so easy to bore a simple post hole, regardless of soil type. I have HEAVY clay, and boring a simple post hole for a fence is so easy it is nuts. Now, to be fair, if you hit a rock of a root, you are going to struggle, you may need to pull out the borer & hit the rock or root with a heavy digging bar.

Turn, dig, pull up & clear the head, repeat.

The fact that the shaft is basically a 3/4"" black iron pipe with standard NPT pipe threads is a bonus when (if) you decide you need a pipe extension.

I am a little nuts, so as someone else posted that he had dug a 30' deep well shaft, I decided to try something similar. As I mentioned I have HEAVY clay, so I wanted to drill a test borehole to see if I could do a dry well. I thought 10' would be enough, it wasn't. I hit super heavy hard sticky clay which is a PAIN to go through, but with steady turns & a constant downward pressure, this thing just gently drills away. My clay was wet, which sounds awful, but it actually digs into it better than dry clay which is like digging into concrete.
So I actually ended up digging down 22' in solid clay & didn't hit any sand, so I gave up trying to make myself a dry well, but I am amazed at how strong, how well built & how easy to use this device is. I cannot recommend it highly enough!

I have also used it for what it is supposed to be used for & dug post holes too and that simple 2'6"" deep hole is EASY & fast to drill, even in my clay. Made setting post holes so much easier.

Just don't expect to keep drilling & never pull it up. Drill about 6"" & pull it up, clear the head, start again.

One piece of advice, regularly check the nut holding the 2 clamshells apart to make sure it is still tight. It will have a tendency to work loose with the constant motion of the head & it would suck to have a deep hole & lose the head. You have been warned. Otherwise, this is a great tool.

I did not get paid, reimbursed, of given anything for free (never do as I am not important enough online!) so you are getting my own unbiased, honest opinion & nothing but that. :-)"
5.0,"Worked out great. Better than using a regular post hole digger. Had to digg a few holes for a fence, and it was a definitely alot quicker and easier on the back than any other shovel. I did have to make an extension to able to reach 3 1/2 feet deep. With out it I think you can reach about 2 to 2 1/2 feet."
5.0,Great product
5.0,"This gadget is phenomenal! So easy to use, love too that it's blue :) anyone who has a farm, or simply wants to build a fence, this has worked better then the post hole digger that opens and closes with2 curved pieces, it pulls dirt out as you spin it down into earth...and it's easy on your back"
4.0,Works real well. I would almost advise getting the version with the fixed metal handle. After putting a screw in it generally breaks and the handle is free. I put two in and it still broke. It actually is not a big deal to have the handle loose and I'm not surprised the screw breaks.
5.0,Works much easier than the clamshell type of digger! Made the hole for my 25ft flagpole simple to dig.
5.0,Just what we wanted. As described. Have used a ton and it is still hanging in there.
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,Works better than anticipated and with a lot less effort.
5.0,It worked great
5.0,"This unit is a very good house, a little time consuming to put together but when finished it is a great Martin house."
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  I was trying to do a martin house as inexpensively as possible when I should have been more concerned about quality.

It took hours to put together!

This bird house is made of cheap, thin metal that has very sharp edges.  Fingers get sliced very easily trying to put it together with the overwhelming amount of parts.  On top of that, it's so lightweight that a strong wind blew the top section off the bottom section, and the plugs blew out of it.  Had anyone been outside in the vicinity when it happened, they'd have been seriously injured.  It's a good thing there weren't martins nesting in it!

Obviously it's too late for me to return it since I've had it for several months.  Instead, it's going into the trash.

Don't waste your money!"
3.0,I purchased 5 months ago and have yet to muster up the courage to put it together.  Way to many pieces and I doubt it will ever look like the picture without the help of an engineer!
3.0,The kit was delivered with missing parts.  The assembly instructions were not clear.  To mount the bird house on a pole you will have to make some creative modifications.
5.0,I already owned houses like this and had to have more. They are easy to put together and easy to clean out. Great design!
1.0,"Flimsy, horrible to assemble and came with parts missing. Otherwise, ok. Bat house from this vender was good waiting for martins and bats."
4.0,"i like it, it came quick, it was fairly easy to put together. i would remend this a friend, it was very good"
2.0,very flimsy and the fitting is not very tight. however come feb when my martins come back if they like them I will change the rating i give the two of them now. right now even those pesky English sparrows are not much interested. and that puzzles me.
4.0,"The Heath Co. in Michigan which manufactures these purple martin make a solid product. The instructions are pretty good but could be better. Especially in the 'exploded' illustrations in the assembly instruction sheets. All the nuts and bolts are there needed to put the house together. It does take time though. You can't rush through the assembly.
  Once assembled and the nuts are snugged up,...you'll have a solid purple martin or barn swallow house for years to come. Of course it's up to the birds if they want to nest there or not!"
1.0,"This house is made of very thin aluminum. Assembly is definitely required using many very small nut and bolt combinations. I could barely get my hands in the various positions to attach the nuts to the bolts. The snap-in plastic perches did not stay in place. The 6 room units are only held to the post by a screw threaded in a plastic bracket, the lower unit twisted in the wind. If price is the only consideration and you can handle a lot of small nuts/bolts, this house may be for you; otherwise get a more substantial house."
5.0,"Really high quality axe with a handle that is a more useable length, than longer handles.  I like this axe a lot for its quality construction and handy size."
5.0,"Great Axe well balanced and great size would love a double headed axe this sixe, well worth the price, would buy again."
5.0,"I was digging a three foot deep hole with a cheep shovel when I hit layer upon layer of sand rock. My cheep pick bit the dust several years ago so I did not hesitate to take this Estwing E45A campers Axe to it. Needless to say, I will not ever have to buy another pick because this Axe went through that sand rock like it was a hot knife through butter. The Axe was not harmed and looks just like new with no chips or cracks. I have always trusted Estwing. My advise for you is always buy an Estwing, just don't put it near your other tools because they will die from a severe inferiority complex."
5.0,In my opinion you just can't beat an Estwing for performance and durability. I should have bought one of these years ago. Sure glad that I have it now. Fast shipping and an easy purchase.
5.0,"I love this camping axe, I used it almost every weekend all winter mostly splitting wood and throwing at a tree. Not saying that it's the best splitting axe but I have split a lot of wood with it.
Also I have thrown it at a tree probably 2000 times, it probably stuck about 700 times and bounced off the tree the rest of the time. Still works! I messed up the bottome of the handle where the impact causes to metal to cut a circle in the bottom but expected.
Wish they made a full size axe like this.... 33"" would be great"
5.0,Because it was exactly what I was looking for. The condition of the item was excellent. It was a great deal.
4.0,I bought this axe to clear out some roots from a bush that was in my back yard. I was able to clear the roots pretty easily (in about 15 minutes) and I feel the axe held up reasonably well.  The size of the axe wouldn't be big enough for splitting logs but that's not what it's made for.
3.0,Good not has heavy as I would like great for splitting kindling needs a longer handle and more weight with the head
5.0,"I'm not a large person.  When I need to chop, I want something that's easy for me to handle.  This is it.  For a six foot six lumberjack, this would just be a toy, but for me, it's perfect.

Also, it came sharp and, after a few uses, it's still sharp.  And the quality appears to be very high."
3.0,"Amazing looking and solidly built product, with the BEST product warranty in it's class... WHY I BOUGHT THIS ONE in the first place, BUT... now the bad. I need this to process wood, to make ready for a real camp fire on many occasions, not just a once in a year deal to tackle a shrub in the back yard that over grown scissors might be able to. By process wood, I mean, after a chain saw has bucked up a tree into small rounds, the splitting comes next, and so the need of a good axe for rounds from 3"" up to 12"", so not very large.

 I bought from reviews, I guess from people that are not aware, all of them, of very small details in axe head profiles that make ALL the difference in making spitting go very easy, even enjoyable, to a hard slug, and an exhausting needless WORKOUT :( ! A splitting axe head which a lot of people said they were happy using this axe for in the reviews, this axe is NOT.

To SPLIT the axe head MUST be more CONVEX from edge to back of head, on the side. This causes the wood to actually ""SPLIT"" without also wedging the axe head into the wood, which this axe profile does EVERY TIME it does not carry through the round, which is very often I am afraid.

To CHOP or FALL trees, I guess this axe WOOD be OK... It DOES HAVE a CONCAVE HEAD profile from edge to back of the head.. which makes for a axe head that sinks DEEP into the wood without causing much splitting at all, as well as the WORST PART, trying to UNWEDGE a fully sunk axe head from a round of wood. Now just try that on every chop on a round, 4 times per round, 20 -30 round per fire, say three times a week... lets just say I am back to using a $20.00 special garbage axe, that just has the right head profile that gets the split done almost EVERY time, only bad about a cheap axe, is the steel in the head is poor, won't hold an edge for long. I AM LOOKING TO FIND THAT QUALITY PERFECT AXE ONCE AGAIN!! PLEASE ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE APPRECIATED!! NON WOOD HANDLES WITH HIGH END STEEL HEADS PREFERRED.

I gave three stars because BEST WARRANTY, tough built, high quality steel is used, with a nice finish, and one of the BEST head cases I have. All their axes come with these. The ONLY PURPOSE I see for this axe is a lager version than a hatchet to take on a boat trip, 4x4 camp trip, etc, to just chop down trees, saplings, etc.. forget the splitting unless you need and want the extra exercise. ALL of their axes (3 sizes, mini hatchet, 16"" hatchet, and the E45A Axe) have this SAME head profile flaw, most unfortunately, or else my axe buying days would be over! NICE EFFORT Eswing, but missed it in the engineering dept for ALL ROUND usefulness."
5.0,This Heath Martin House is to replace a similar one damaged by 8 years of wind damage and is better quality with some added features. I am very pleased with the packaging and received condition!
1.0,Bought a 3 story Heath house and pole.  Impossible to assemble unless one has fingers like ET.  Unassembled what little was done and repackaged for return.  Paying bigtime for return UPS shipping.  What a waste.  Description on this should highlight that assembly IS DIFFICULT and at least some humans think it is IMPOSSIBLE!
4.0,Beautiful bird house but very time consuming to put together. MANY PARTS! My husband will build the pole to put it on since the ones available seem flimsy.
4.0,"I have purchased 6 of these houses over the years.  The perches will pop off no matter how carefully you secure them.
Assembly took me about 2 hours.... and I have done this before.  Final product is fine.  The matching pole,... not so fine.
I also purchased the rectangular plastic house, (made in the USA).  I prefer the metal one, (China).  I am not using the plastic one."
4.0,"All parts fit together well. Excellent parent-child project. My 10 yr old son enjoyed putting it together with me. He was careful to watch the sharp edges as not to injury himself. Cons: apartments are shallow so it made then into 2 rooms buy cutting out a door between them that way the bird can hide from preying birds (ie, owls) by going deeper in. Obviously, you will plug one hole.  My original 18 room is now 9."
2.0,"One of the roof panels was cut wrong and didn't fit properly, we had to manipulate it to make it fit.  When you pay for something new you expect it to be done right.  I was very disappointed in this product."
4.0,"The Purple Martins like this house, but it was a chore putting it all together. Since putting it up, the rails where the birds sit all have come off. They only pop into a hole. I will try putting them back in place and putting a small screw in the bottom to expand the piece that pops into the hole.
The instructions were not very clear and were for one level only. It was not clear how to put the 3 levels together. I would rate the intructions as 00000."
5.0,The house was up for only about 20 minutes before the birds were checking it out. By the next day tey were clearly satisfied and moving in. I will by another one next year.
5.0,"This box is quite the hotel for purple martins.  After assembly and putting it up for the birds, they were quick to check it out.  We already have residents!"
5.0,"This was a bit of a challenge to put together, but I like that.  Once finished, it is a beautiful house for our purple martins, which immediately took up residency."
5.0,amazing thing! dug 6 post holes with it. it really does the job easily. I put a little tape at the handle center so it doesnt roll around.
5.0,"This is the best hand digging post hole tool on the market. With the help of a digging bar, it makes digging holes a snap. The hole size is adjustable, so you can plant posts, trees or whatever. The length of the pole could be adjustable too if you got some iron pipe extensions. Everyone always wants to borrow this from me. It's awesome!"
5.0,Digs great.  I had sandy soil which it chewed through.  I was worried it would dribble out as I lifted the auger out of the hole but that was not an issue.  Packaging was poor and something blew out the side of the box but the unit itself was great.
5.0,"I used this to dig a 20' well (by adding sections of 3/4"" iron pipe to extend it) to water my garden, and it worked wonderfully. I think the price is a bit high, but considering how easy it was, I'd happily pay the price again and again! I have the urge to throw away my clamping post-hole diggers now, just so that I'm never tempted to use them again!"
5.0,"Wonderful tool! I am so glad I bought it! It saved a lot of time digging the fence post holes. The clam digger has its place, too, and with this auger type of digger added, so much effort and time was saved."
5.0,I bought this auger to dig holes approx. four to five feet deep. I purchased extra lengths of pipe and dug as far as 10 ft. deep. Paid for itself first time used.
5.0,"In heavy Georgia clay, this performed very well - MUCH better than the 'grab and pinch' versions!"
1.0,Bought it but never used it. I could dig a hole faster with my hands in my type of hard soil.
5.0,"Great Tool. Fast service, thanks"
5.0,Works great!
4.0,very hard to put together.  Had to use a C shaped vise grips to hold the 3 sheets of sheet metal together and an ice-pick to line the holes up for the little screws.
4.0,Great bird house but one of the front panels for the house was missing. We would like to keep it and just have them send us the front panel.
1.0,"The instructions for this birdhouse are the most useless I have ever seen.  The aluminum is thin and bends easily.  My husband and I just spent 6 hours putting together the top floor and bottom floors.  We both have cuts on our hands from the sharp edges.  There should be PICTURES indicating that each floor is put together entirely separate from each other and come together only when you slide them on the pole.  The pieces fit together poorly and do not line up easily to get the bolts and nuts on.  We have two more floors to finish, but could only take so much in one day.
The finished product may be ok from the birds point of view, but we would definitely not purchase from this company again even though we now know how to assemble it from 6 hours of trial and error, no credit to the poorly written instructions."
4.0,This is a good value for the price.  The pieces fit o.k. but are not perfect but it is a birdhouse after all.  Like other reviews it requires a serious amount of assembly.  If you are not a hands on handy person this is not the birdhouse for you.  The directions are mediocre at best.  If you like a challenge it is like putting a puzzle together.
2.0,"I'm disappointed at how many pieces there are and how many hours (yes, plural) that it takes to assemble.  The plastic perches keep popping out.  I just bought the house with two floors.  I had hoped that a piece of thinwall conduit would suffice for the post since I don't really care if it telescopes.  The additional post is another $50.  The mounts in the house are tapered and a standard piece of conduit doesn't seem like it is going to work. If I had it to do over again, I would leave this one alone."
5.0,Have the exact house for over 20 yrs.  very good house. I am replacing a plastic house that fell apart after 5 yrs with this new aluminum one
5.0,"this bird house is sturdy ,nice looking and the birds liked it ,looks nice in the back yard and you can see it from the road ...i think its more decorative than gourds...my opinion...I'm happy"
5.0,We bought two took my husband a couple hours to put together now hoping the Martins (birds) love it as much as we do . I love the way they look in my  yard
5.0,Was a little tough to put together. The metal is very sharp. When completed it's a wonderful addition to the yard.
5.0,"This is my third Heath Martin House...not because they didn't hold up, but because they are so good and the Martin's love them.  My first one is ten years old and with the exception of losing its roof cap in the wind and a couple of perches, it's as good as the day I bought it.  They are a bit of a challenge to assemble but anyone with entry level handyman skills and moderate dexterity  should be able to pull it off in about 40 minutes per unit.  Be sure to have all the tools handy, layout and count the parts.  some of the edges can be a little sharp so be careful.  This product has been precision cut and drilled so I found that I had to make no alterations or widen any holes.  When I was tempted to do so, I soon learned that I had something backwards or misaligned.  Be patient in assembly.  These mount high and have a fair amount of wind-age.  I would suggest ordering the heavier mounting pole."
5.0,"Bought this on a suggestion from a friend, and I must say I was not disappointed.  I was sinking 4x4's for a building and it took me like 5 minutes a hole and I was digging 20 of them. With my old post hole digger it would have taken me twice as long.  What can I say I won't go back to my old diggers again.  Even thinking it might be time to build that fence after seeing how easy it was to use."
5.0,"I had to straighten the threads to add in a 3/4"" gas pipe extension. Other than that, this is the best post hole digger I've ever owned."
5.0,"i was really happy with this product. I did not  think it would work as well as it did i made a couple extensions (just a 3/4 ridgid threaded pipe and a coupling ) worked well for the deep holes i had to dig (7Ft deep) worked pretty good i recommend it. Don""t waste your money on the clam shell digger"
5.0,The perfect tool for digging a shallow well for a pitcher pump.  We were able to dig down with extension to about 20 feet in just a few hours - made the job so much easier
5.0,"My father thought this was an expensive gimmic... I relied on Amazon reviewers and they were true, this thing is excellent. If you have soil without rocks then it's great. The top 5 inch of my soil have roots, so I have to break and remove the roots first. After that layer, it basically carve out the dirt like an icecream scoop. 2 1/2 turn fills the scoop with dirt. The handle was genius, it's tapered, so you push it in tight, then push it out for storage. No screws needed. Definitely buy this adjustable one, I used the 6"" position for 4x4 and 8"" position for 4x8 pole. Dug a 2 1/2 foot hole in maybe 2 minutes taking my time, more like one minute. Now if your soil have rocks in them, this tool is no good. Even a 1 inch rock will stop this from going in, so be prepared to pick out rocks if you run into one. I will keep this tool the rest of my life and will be proud to pass it on to my son. It's that good."
5.0,"Pretty solidly built unit.  I added an extension to go deeper and it worked well.

You can skip your cardio regimen for the day after 5 holes :^)

Would recommend to a friend that needed an occasional post hole."
5.0,"I ordered this on Amazon because all the home improvement stores only sell the Other style, which I'm not a fan of.  This auger was perfect for digging my driveway drain. I love that that is adjustable.  I plan on using it for fence posts next."
5.0,This works great. Not as good as a tractor with a post hole auger but for doing it by hand works great.
5.0,You will never go back to digging with post hole diggers ever again.  This thing cuts like butter!
4.0,It works well
5.0,"The size of the cutting head was perfect--length of the handle was just right--cutting ability was better then I expected,nothing seems to be the way you really want it to be in alot of tools. This axe is now one of my best buys in tools! I enjoy useing it!!"
5.0,"My father had an Estwing # 45 axe since the 1960's ~ he wasn't particularly kind to his tools ~ he used them a lot ~
left them where-ever he wanted ~ and didn't make any attempt at preserving or protecting them.
Still ~ his Estwing axe survived ~ I have it now-days ~ cleaned it up ~ sharpened the cutting edge and it's as sharp & useful as ever.

After all these years the leather sheath is still together, it's styled just like the current sheath, with tooled acorns & leaves
and two 1 1/2"" belt slits on the back side for carrying. (older also tooled 'Estwing 45')
The leather needs some TLC to get supple again but the stitching ~ 2 snaps and 8 rivets (now-days 7)
have held up through some diverse times.

Dad used this axe a ton ~ around the farm & on our family vacations (in his pop-up camper) for fire wood ~
and when he was 'blazing a trail' to a new fishing spot.

I noticed this older version is lighter weight ~ 3 lb rather then the current 4.3 pound ~ still the same 26"" length.
Showing some wear & tear ~ which reflects some found memories ~ this old # 45 is still as useful as a new axe.

Bottom line ~ this quality axe will last a life time."
5.0,"I bought this (from Amazon) for my son after I bought mine from a local hardware store. I use a chain saw a lot for keeping saplings in control on our property. I wanted something with a shallow angle so it would cut limbs with one or at most two swings. From my actions you can see I was delighted with my purchase.  I appreciate the quality of the leather sheath that covers the head and protects both the cutting edge and the user!

By the way I love the shock absorbing properties of wooden handles, but the steel handle of this axe is really good.  No worry about breaking it and the soft handle cover works great.

By the way, I think this might fit the category of limbing axe.  I'm an old guy at 62, but I was raised around a lot of old timers.  They reached first for a lightweight limbing axe a lot like this one."
5.0,"I bought this item after previously owning the Eastwing hatchet, both are great values and quality products.
Recommend for camping."
5.0,"Not your primary splitter, but a must have around the house if the use fire wood. This will make short work of dry logs, as well as is extremely helpful with smaller trees and branches.

Keep in mind it is shorter then a splitting axe and thus needs to have a ""big brother"" around to do that type work. That said once wood is dry, if you want to split it smaller etc this will work wonders!!!

Keep away from small finger though as it is very sharp and though it appears to be ""kid sized"" this tool delivers adult size results."
5.0,"I have never owned an axe this powerful...wow...I chopped a 4"" tree in about 6 chops....great weight and sharpness ."
5.0,"This is a very good axe. Went through logs like nothing. I chopped about 6, 6 inch thick logs, checked the blade and it was still sharp like I've never used it Takes big chunks off the logs"
5.0,"i really like this axe. i bought this axe at a home improvement store years ago and have not been let down by its performance. this is a general purpose axe, it is not designed to fell trees or split wood. it is like any other eastwing product with an all steel handle, except that where the blue color starts from the stamped steel the handle becomes a pipe that has been welded to the upper one piece axe head and shaft. i was not expecting this tho it was probably done to conserve weight. i use mine to chop roots and other torturous tasks not normally associated with proper axe use. use a chain saw to fell trees and a splitting maul to split, this is just for kindling or abuse. don't waste your time trying to fell a tree with it, thats why God made chain saws."
5.0,"I bought this with the Lansky ""The Puck"".  It came dull.  However, 8 times on each side of the ax edge, in circle motion, it was able to chop through 2"" limbs with one swing!  It chopped a 4"" willow in under 5 minutes!  Goes through pine like it's not even there (1"" limbs)!  If you needed to make a fire, this ax would come in handy clearing the branches off a pine for tinder, fast!  I like it so much, I'll probably buy another one! It's Estwing, made in U.S.A.!  I'll continue to purchase the 16"" and 13"" Estwing Hatches.  These also come in the Black Eagle Collector's Editions for a little bit more!  Wear eye protection!  Clean cuts through 1""-2"" branches with one to two swings!  It's just a great tool to have on hand!"
5.0,"It is not a full-sized axe and will not do the same kind of work as a full-sized axe.  It is great for limbing, gathering wood for a camp fire, light weight splitting jobs, backpacking, etc."
1.0,Did not get it. You never mailed it 2 me. Would like my money back now!!!!!You need 2 email me. and send my money 2 me. Not happy at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"Don't buy it!  It was very difficult to put together, taking 2 home maintenence teachers 2 hours.  If the house gets invaded with other birds, it is almost impossible to remove the nest material without completely disassmebling the entire house.  You cannot open the front without unscrewing the attachment to the next box.  (I will probably have to disassemble the entire house to clean at the end of the season.) The perchers fall off and I have yet to figure out a good way to secure them--it will be raining baby purple martins.  The two levels don't stay together well so the lower level tenants might get rained on.  The cupola does not stay on so it had to anchored with a screw after this was discovered--naturally after it was up on the pole.

I have another house by a different manufacturer that is sooooo much easier to work with.  Don't be fooled by the cute appearance.  Cheap material and bad design are simply not worth it!"
1.0,"This birdhouse comes unassembled with literally hundreds of tiny screws.  Assembly is a nightmare.  Do NOT buy this product.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heath-18-Room-Aluminum-Purple-Martin-House-Model-AH-18D/dp/B0002LBGIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heath 18 Room Aluminum Purple Martin House (Model AH-18D)</a>"
3.0,"This is a very nice house.  It's important to note when putting it together that it is not a two story house.  It is actually two one-story houses.  There are many parts and many screws to this house.  It made my hands cramp from all of the contortions it puts you through, and it took over 3 hours.  I found the roof to be impossible  to put on without going to my local hardware store to pick up longer machine screws.

I would have given the house a 5 star rating if it was easier to put together.  The overall looks and quality are excellent."
1.0,I retired as owner of a fabricating business and beleive me this is a nightmare to put together. The screws are at least a number four and almost impossible to work through three layers of about a 22 ga tissue thin aluminum stamping. I ordered a pop-rivet gun and riveted rather than screw the parts together. The metal is so thin that one might easily use two peices thinking there is only one. I could continue my complaints but I think I have made my point.
5.0,Takes about 3 hours to assemble.  Lots of screws and nuts.  However Martins love it.  Ordered a second house since I had so many martis the first year.
3.0,"First, this takes a lot of work and patience to put together properly and the instructions are poorly written.  Second, the rails the birds are supposed to sit on do not stay in place and are poorly designed. They do not fit well into the holes and keep falling off.  If you buy this, be prepared to spend 2-3 hours putting it together and it will take 2 people at the same time for some of the steps."
4.0,"I bought the 24 room martin house.  It is well designed and assembled very easily.  However, people with poor mechanical capabilities should not buy this house because it requires some dexterity with a screwdriver.

There are two minor flaws but both are easily corrected.  The white rails are easily dislodged.  They snap in place and I had to use glue to fix them permanently.

There is no false roof for the top layer so it gets very hot in Texas.  I cut out and added a hexagonal top insulated section between the top layer of nests and the external metal roof."
5.0,"Put it together while watching a movie.  It seems to be solid enough but will be adding epoxy where the plastic rails snap in.  The reviewer who likened it to a Erector set was spot on.  It was actually fun, but watch out for some sharp edges."
5.0,"The bird house is great but have to say putting it together was a bit of a task!  It took 2 of us about 6 hours to complete but I'm sure when we present it on Christmas day it will all be worth it!

It's Beautiful!"
5.0,"We had this style post hole digger when I was a kid (50 + years ago).  Ours was non-adjustable and actually was a bit bigger in diameter--probably 10"", because we could put a railroad tie in it--very helpful for the corners of corrals, etc.

The auger works by grabbing the wooden handle and rotating in a clockwise direction--if 2 people are doing it, you stand facing each other and just hand off the handle to the other person.  After the tool fills with dirt, just lift it carefully and dump it... Works much faster and with less effort than the clamshell or pinch style diggers.

This works well even in the hard pan soil we have in Northern Utah.  Sometimes you have to break up the soil a little with a pointed bar, but generally it will do the trick without it.

If the bar is too short--screw in an extension to it--this saves you having to bend over as the hole goes down into the ground."
5.0,"Works great.  I wish it would expand up to 12""...or have different sized heads that can be switched out."
5.0,"I'm not a farmer or a construction person I had never used one of this things, got mine yesterday and already used it today. This Auger its amazing dug a 8"" wide X 24"" deep hole in like 20 minutes effortless for been the first time in my 57 years, love it already."
5.0,I have used one of these before and for a project of my own it was just the ticket. A lot easier than using a clam shell style post hole digger.
3.0,Didn't work like I hoped guess my Texas clay is to tough for it . Works good for first foot in top soil though.
5.0,"Love this thing! MUCH, MUCH better than a traditional digger that you have to thrust down into the hole."
5.0,Excellent product. Fast delivery
3.0,"My parents had a similar version of this post hole auger design.  I wanted one as well, because I was able to bore holes for a fence very quickly. I thought the adjustable size is a great bonus feature.  However,  I'm surprised it arrived dull! :-(  I'm struggling to cut through pre-tilled dirt in the garden-in order to plant a small rosemary bush! The engineering /technology behind the design seems fine, so I am going to use my Dremel tool with an attachment to sharpen the blades.
  I also wish the adjustment in size would be possible with a thumb screw or some sort of cotter pin - so I wouldn't need to bring mechanical tools into my garden (dirt isn't great for some tools)."
3.0,It does what is is supposed to do.
4.0,Worked great to dig 12 fence posts. Unfortunately I have some soil filled with rocks so had to continually stop to dig them out. Never bent the tool when running into those rocks. It Worked much better than the clam shell digger. Buy a good spud bar and you will get through anything.
1.0,I didn't have any problems with this model bird house until it came time to clean out last years nesting.  It was then that I figured out that you need to disassemble the bird house to clean it!  Look for another model that has easily removable panels - not this one...
5.0,"THIS IS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAVE PURCHASED. A LITTLE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER BUT FUN... ONE NEGATIVE, THE PLASTIC LEGS THAT ARE ON THE FLOOR WILL EVENTUALLY GET WORN..I SAND DOWN THE PART THAT GOES THROUGH THE HOLE, DRILL A SMALL HOLE THEN PUT A SCREW AND WASHER TO HOLD IT TO THE FLOOR. WORKS GREAT AND I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE STEPS FALLING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON. ADDITIONALLY I DRILL A HOLE THROUGH THE MOUNTING POLE AT THE TOP WHERE THE CAP IS. THE PLACE AT 3 FOOT ROD THROUGH IT, THEN PUT THE CAP ON.  THE BIRDS LOVE IT.  LEAVES ABOUT A 1/4 INCH GAP FROM THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND THE CAP... ALSO I PLACE ONE OF THOSE SCREW TYPE HOSE CONNECTORS AROUND THE POLE WHERE THE BOTTOM OF THE LOWER HOUSE SETS NEXT TO THE SET SCREW.  ONE LAST THING I MARK EVERYTHING WITH SHARPIE SO WHEN I TAKE IT APART IT'S EASY TO SET UP AFTER CLEANING ETC."
5.0,"Easy to put together, sturdy, love it.  Good material and seem to be able to hold up well with our winters."
4.0,"Instructions for multilevel should be separate from single level. Some difficulty in attaching small nuts and bolts in such cramped areas. Would have paid more for an assembled product, after the fact."
4.0,"I own another two-story Martin house manufactured by these folks, and it has served me well for about twenty-five years; so when I found this one I was elated.
Some changes have occurred in the way parts are assembled during this time...some good, some not as good; however, overall this new hous is pretty good.
One hinderance is that the parts need to be de-bured, as some have sharp edges and can cut while being handled.
The instructions provided were satisfactory with assembly time, overall, probably taking about two hours or a little better...reading the instructions, trial fitting of the parts, etc. Mine is the four-story bird apartment.
Also, I did not use the pole sold by Heath, but instead used another pole that is a litle larger, so I had to enlarge the plastic bushings provided at the center of each floor (4 in my case).
My birdhouse has been up for about a month, now, and is inhabited with Martins.
I like it and might very well get another for our feathered mosquito eaters."
3.0,"Neutral: It did take a few hours to assemble like everyone else has said - not that big of a deal - just do it while you watch TV.

Positive: It is a very attractive, modular design and it will no-doubt last for years to come.  Made of no-rust aluminum and plastic.  It does attract purple martins.  It comes with hole plugs to close the house during the winter (this is important for martin housing).  Drainage holes on the outside porch before entering the bird house.

Negative:  I've had my house for 3 years now.  When I first got it as a gift, I didn't really know what purple martins were.  Since then, I've learned a bit about purple martins and martin housing.  (1) They definitely prefer larger compartments (about 6""x12"") and seem to nest in this house only after all the larger living quarters are taken.  This house seems to attract the smaller, younger birds - possibly due to size - possibly due to the fact they arrive latest after all the premium homes are taken.  They can lay 5 or more eggs and all birds need to fit in the same house.  They like to be further away from the entrance in case of predators and to stay out of poor weather.  (2)  It's actually a bit of work to maintain a purple martin house - it's not like sticking up a house for robins or sparrows.  You need to check the nests periodicaly, etc.  So, your purple martin house should be easily accessible and easy to open to see the nests.  This one is not.  (3)  MOST IMPORTANTLY:  The newer designs have Starling Resistant Entry Holes (""SREH"").  These are smaller, crescent-shaped holes which are difficult for the European Starlings to enter.  If you read up on purple martins, you'll see how important this is.  (4)  There are other little design factors that are not accounted for like non-slip floors, drainage holes, dividers between entrance holes, preferred distance between the entrance hole and floor, etc.  All-in-all, this house seems to be designed more for looks than function.  They DID get the color correct though!

Last comments:  I plan to remove the divider between every other compartment to make larger compartments, then permanently close every other hole.  I believe the smaller compartments is why I only get smaller birds late in the season after the other homes get too crowded.  For the remaining holes, I will make them conform to the new SREH standards.

Hope this helps!"
4.0,"LOVE THE MARTIN BIRD HOUSE
IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER SO WE RATED  4 STARS
IT LOOKS GREAT IN THE ROSE GARDEN
BEST PRICE WE COULD FIND
THANKS"
4.0,"This little unit is just great for the beginner!  It's very true that some of the pieces are sharp and one should be very careful while assembling.  I didn't find it nearly as hard to construct as some have indicated on this review page.  You just have to be patient!  I would highly recommend that you read the instructions all the way through before you start this project as some of the steps are a little misleading, (I would have saved myself a little time and trouble if I had read the entire assembly instructions BEFORE I had started!!)  All in all this house is pretty sturdy when completed and looks great along my back fence.  Appears as though the price has risen considerably since I purchased mine a couple of months ago ($29.99 w/free shipping from Amazon)."
1.0,"Agree with all the one stars.  An absolute nightmare to assemble.  After calling their customer service the fourth time over a four day period I finally got a return call.  Surprise, they included the wrong instructions in the box.  Said they had received lots of customer complaints.  Not helpful at all.
Having a mechanical engineering degree plus four hands and a first aid kit would be helpful for assembly.  Unless you just want a challenge and have nothing else to do, go somewhere else!"
4.0,"I like it but from the picture it looks a lot sturdier.  It bends very easily and it is made from a very thin aluminum.  I even cut myself on it ..  It has very thin pointy edges.  The overall size was exactly as listed.  But the material was thin and cheap.  The white plastic rail for the birds to perch on keeps falling off, I cannot get them to stay in the holes that are drilled in the aluminum.  I had no option but to keep the bird house because it took days to put together and is too big and costly to back.  I was not going to mention this problem, but you emailed me asking if I would review this product.  Overall it was too much money for such poor quality aluminum."
3.0,"I got several of these birdhouses for my Dad.  He is quite pleased with the birdhouses but recommends that people who are not mechanically inclined and experienced with tools attempt these things.  He bought extra screws and bolts for this project.  After a bit of customization, he was quite pleased with the birdhouses.  Don't buy these kits to assemble with young children.  You probably shouldn't get one of these if you find Ikea furniture kits challenging."
5.0,"This was everything they advetised it to be. It does take some time to put togather but it is well worth it. It is well built, very good materials, solid."
3.0,"First the good news.  We put up the Martin house and the Martins are already moving in.  When this house is completed, it makes for a very nice and attractive house.  Now for the bad news.  This house comes out of the box in lots, and I mean lots, of pieces.  Some of the pieces are quite small and you have to be careful not to cut a hand or finger in the assembly process.  The nuts and bolts are also tiny and have to be inserted in very tight spaces. You will drop each one a couple of times before finally getting them started.  It simply takes too long to assemble.  If I figure my time at say, $15 per hour, the finished house cost me about $300.  Still, it is nice now to see the martins moving in."
4.0,"well,like everybody says,there is a lot of parts,it does have sharp edges,so be careful handling parts,it really is not that bad to put together,just sit down relax take your time.watch a program on tv or listen to the radio,it will take about 2/12 to 3 hours,taking your time,finished product looks great,putting one together again would be a piece of cake,i would buy another one no problem,hardest thing to put on was the roof,TAKE YOUR TIME!"
5.0,"I felt compelled to write this review after reading all the negative comments about this Martin house using ""hundreds"" of bolts, and of the poor husbands who had to drill new holes because they weren't aligned right from the factory.  Here are the facts:

The AH-12D uses exactly 66 nuts/bolts for the entire house, plus one screw for the cupola, and one bolt for each pole flange anchor.  Whoever said the unit uses ""hundreds"" of bolts is full of it.

Of the three houses we purchased, there were exactly ZERO holes misaligned.  I think those who complained of this did not follow the basic rule of assembly which is to only finger-tighten the bolts until each sub-assembly is complete (it even says this in the instructions).  This allows the pieces to move around slightly so all the holes can be easily aligned.

If you are someone with little patience, or if you are not good with a wrench and a screwdriver, then steer clear of this unit.  On the other hand, if you are someone who has a little mechanical ability and common sense, and you can read a diagram and follow instructions, then you will have no problem putting this house together.

My daughter assembled two houses without any help, and they turned out perfectly.  I assembled one in about two hours with similar results. They are quite sturdy and should last a long time."
5.0,I got my dad this same house from Sears about 20 years ago or more.  He never had much luck attracting martins but he doesn't live hea water and it was mounted only about 10 ft high.  When I discovered that he'd taken it down I asked if I could have it.  We live on a lake and I set it up about 15 ft high right on the lake shore.  We've had occupants every year since.  The house feels lightweight but it is still in great shape after all these years.  I think the light weight is good because with the nests and birds inside that is more weight and the box sways a little in a heavy wind.
4.0,"This is the second one I have purchased. The first one lasted well over 20 years. This one was as difficult to assemble as the first one, and can only be described as tricky,if not just plain miserable. But, for the price,it is worth the hassel. Heath should read the latest books on Martins and modify the design to connect two compartments and block off every other entrance. Drilling 2in dia. holes in thin aluminum to connect the compartments is fussy.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heath-Outdoor-Products-AH-12D-Martin-House-Aluminum/dp/B0006856E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heath Outdoor Products AH-12D Martin House Aluminum</a>"
1.0,"Assembly is like building a house of cards from razor blades.  All of the roof, wall and floor panels have extremely sharp edges, there are hundreds of tiny bolts and you really need 4 hands to have a somewhat fair shot at assembling this thing.  You can absolutely forget about having a small child or grandchild help you with assembly -it's a serious occupational hazard.  How do the birds live in this thing without slicing themselves all up on the sharp edges?

We can put people into space, but this is the best offering that mankind can produce for a purple martin house?"
1.0,"I bought one of these houses five years ago. I have built and bought martin house for over forty years and this one is the worst one I have ever tried to use. First the perches keep falling off. I had to tap the plastic and put a washer and screw on each post before they would stay on. The clean out bottoms will fall open for no reason. I installed the pole head pipe in concrete and the pole worked pretty good for a couple of years. I removed it every season and made a cover for the head pipe opening. The third year it was all I could do to to get the first pole into the ground mount. At the end of the season, I had to use a pipe wrench and a piece of pipe to try to get the lower pipe out of the ground by pulling up as I walked around in circles. It would not come out. So now I have the first section of pole sticking up in my yard all year. I had to rivet the bottom clean out section just to keep it together. The plastic piece that holds each section up in place broke and now the house is unusable without those 2 special pieces. There was always gaps between the sections when it was on the pole. I think that is enough to change your mind."
1.0,"Very disappointing.  a box of parts with marginal instructions.  no where in the description of the product was this disclosed.  value and cost do not relate at all.

returned."
5.0,Works great in PA
5.0,"Dug about 8 holes at 8"" each to put 4x4's in.  Dug down to 3.5 ft and this thing was very easy to use.  I had a lot of rocks and roots in the yard and with out this would never had completed job."
5.0,"Wow....a back and knuckle saver.  We were able to dig four foot deep post holes under the default configuration, though it does have threads to extend it if necessary."
5.0,"Twisting makes it easy in clay as long as not too wet. The spade type of post hole digger as impossible for me, this is much better."
5.0,This product is well built and works great.
5.0,"Works great in our 80% Clay soil.  Works when the pincher type didn't.  I have drilled dozens of 4' holes, and you can extend it with an iron pipe if needed.  Drills a 4' hole in about 10 minutes, when a 2' hole took me 30 mins with the pincher type.  Way less impact on your joints.  It produces a clean straight hole."
5.0,quality
5.0,best manual post hole digger I have used period.
5.0,"Throw away your clamshell post hole digger and get this. This is so superior to the traditional post hole digger that there's no reason to ever use a clamshell post hole digger again.  I bought this to dig the holes for a wooden swing set I was building for the kids. We have hard clay soil with small rocks, and I was not looking forward to spending hours and hours digging the holes for the posts.  I remember how long it took to just dig the hole for the mailbox. I saw some mentions of the auger type post hole digger, specifically this one by Seymour, so I decided to give it a try.

This auger is incredible. It works like you would think it does: You turn the handle to rotate the auger, and it dig through the dirt. Periodically, you lift it out of the hole to remove some of the dirt or any rocks you encounter. It only took about ten minutes of relatively easy work (compared to the old fashioned clamshell post hole digger) to dig a two foot deep hole. And the holes are almost perfectly round.  It's nearly impossible to do that with a clamshell post hole digger, and certainly not a two foot deep hole. If you do encounter a rock, it gets pulled out of the dirt by the auger (assuming it's not a giant boulder, of course).

The auger is very well made. I've used it since to dig other holes and it has really held up well. Very solid metal construction, and it has a good heavy duty wood handle. I'm sure I will continue to get many years of life out of it. I'm glad I bought it, it tuned what would have been hours of back breaking work into just a few minutes."
5.0,"Awesome tool, much better than the clamshell type in clay soil."
5.0,"I take this axe with me on every camping trip I go on. It is a great axe, it is well balanced, keeps a great edge, and it fits in the trunk of my car. It is easy to manage, and easy to keep sharp. It is a good camping axe. I would recommend it to anyone."
5.0,"I was looking for a jack of all trades, master of none axe that was not made in India, China, or Mexico.  This was the one for me and I am very happy with it.  I spoke with Estwing customer service (Illinois) that day I bought it.  They were very helpful and said if there are any defects at ANY time to take a couple pictures and send it to them to review.  If there are any workmanship issues (having since received it I can say there aren't) they will replace for free.  I can't wait to take it camping.  I've split some unseasoned hard wood with it already and it performs as expected.  Love my new axe."
5.0,"I have used axes a lot for over 50 years, and I think the Estwing Camper Axe is the best one out there for the price.  Best feature is,... no more broken handles.  Has a good grip, good balance, and hammer end is better than most.  Only bad thing about this axe,.. it doesn't float."
5.0,I bought this axe after reading all of the positive reviews here on amazon and i must say i am completely satisfied. Estwing hammers are my favorite and now i can say their axes are as well.
5.0,"I have always been impressed by Estwing's quality having purchased a hammer for my apprenticeship as a plumber 20 yrs ago and still using it! I expect to get many years of use with this axe during our family camping trips!
It was delivered to me in excellent new condition with the sheath included!
Thank you Amazon"
5.0,"great product, exactly what it says it is and nothing more nothing less, very sturdy, doesnt weigh very much and is fairly comfortable in the hand."
5.0,"It seems that everything is made poorly these days.  This product has the quality it always had and has a feel of quality.  I use it to split wood for my wood smoker doing briskets, ribs, and pulled pork.  Can use one handed or slide down to the end of the handle to use two handed for more accurate splitting.  I oiled the sheath that can with it to protect it as well.  A product you will pass on to your grandchildren."
5.0,"I was trying to remove a small tree stump, using a hatchet, and it wasn't going well.  My wife said, ""always use the right tools.""  So I got this axe.

My wife was right, this was the right tool and it got the job done.  I am very pleased with this axe.  It came sharp, and has a functional leather axe head cover."
5.0,This axe is a perfect size for splitting wood and all around camping duties.  The price is fair and best of all it's MADE IN USA!!
5.0,"I've had three of these things. Lost the first one and pretty sure the last one I had got stole from me. They're worth the cost...every penny of them. Decent weight. I carried one the entire 453 mile length of the Colorado Trail believe it or not. Makes a good hammer and balances real nice when you're chopping, plus they look medevil if you got to defend yourself against a bear or crazed mountain man or something."
3.0,"We were given this brand, Heath, as a gift two years ago.  It did fine the first year.  However, when we put it up for the second season, the perches and floors were loose.  I have just seen that one of the ""apartment"" floors has fallen off as well as several perches.  The fallen nest looked to be empty; I hope that was the case.  I am now looking for a purple martin house for my brother, and I won't buy a Heath again."
3.0,"Pretty , but difficult to assemble and it only works on a certain kind of pole"
4.0,"I purchased the Heath 18 room Martin House about a month ago even though there was a cautionary review on assembly.

It was not difficult to assemble, just took a lot of time.  I changed the method of assembling the roof from a two person job to a one person job.  I did this by assembling one panel at a time directly to the top hose. This works fine because all the parts fit together really well.  I left the floor off until I assembled the complete roof and then snapped in the floor.
 One other item I modified was the plastic rail that  attaches to the floor by snapping it into the holes provided.  I found that some of the rails had a tendency to snap out when bumped.  I remedied this by turning the house upside down and placing it in a small plastic garbage can for support then mixed epoxy and dabbed epoxy on the bottom of the plastic rails which formed a strong bond when dry between the rail and the aluminum."
5.0,"This appears to be the same house as sold by Sears over 30 years ago. Had it with me while in the air force. Very popular with Martins. Enjoyed their company and melodious chatter for many years while stationed from Florida to North Dakota. For best results you should live within a half mile or so of a body of water and have a fairly open yard. Assembly is a piece of cake. (ever put together an steel storage shed?) Good quality. Light weight. Cool for the birds. This hobby is not set up and forget. Like a home aquarium, you have to learn to maintain it properly, treat your quests with love and respect and they'll come back year after year. Interesting, they do seem to enjoy your company just as much as you do theirs. Highly recommended."
4.0,"I've put four of these together and have had minimal difficulty in the assembly. I guess the main item to remember is to make sure the peak cap retainers fit into the pole, and not just through the roof opening.  To make sure the cap stays on during very strong winds, I put about 4 dabs of silicone sealer on the rim of the cap before pushing it down into place.  The first one I put up has been there for six years, and is still in as good condition as it was when I put it up.  Once assembled, it is rather stiff and consolidated.  Only complaint is the problem of attaching the rails to the floor plate.  Rail post must ""click"" into the designed holes or it will not stay.  I have plans to add another set of apartments after this next season is over."
1.0,"Please, please, please!  I beg you NOT to buy this birdhouse.  There are NO included directions, the company web site has NO directions online.  There is NO support at all.  We have a pile of scrap metal on our kitchen table and two very disappointed children.  I will be going to Home Depot or Lowes!"
5.0,"I bought the 12 room version of this house about 10 years ago.  It has held up extreemly well.  It does take patience and time to assemble, but well worth the effort.  The extension pole which I set in concrete works very well and I have had no problems with the lock on the sections.  I recently moved and intend to set it up again.  As soon as a colony is established I will be buying another of these houses or adding more floors to the one I have."
1.0,"Purchased this through Amazon.com. Package arrived quickly. After receiving the house I tried for 4 hours to put it together. The parts would not line up for a proper fit. I put it together twice. Once completed, the house looked terrible. I boxed the house up and returned it to Amazon. Check out the other reviews, they had similar problems. I wish I would have listened to them. Don't waste your time on it."
5.0,I am a Man not big hands but not little . The bird house took me 6 hrs thou the instructions out difficult to understand so i used some common since . Great construction just be careful it is thin aluminum. I placed mine on a pole that is bracketed on a 4 by 4 pole i don't see how it would stand alone.
4.0,"I bought this house because I really like the way it looks and I think it will remain in tack for many years. You can start off with 6 apartments and expand all the way to 24 as your colony grows.  I must warn you that if you dislike assembling things, have a drink before starting.  It's actually not difficult; it just requires a lot of patience and attention to the instructions (if you can call it that).  The instructions are a bit vague for both the house and pole assembly, but if you're accustomed to putting things together, you'll be fine.  The roof of the house was the most difficult.  The screws for the roof should have been a bit longer to make it easier to get the nuts started.  I was able to assemble the house without any help in 2 hours.  The notches on the porch rails could have been a bit longer as well.  I was able to assemble the house cut and scratch free.  The house really doesn't have any place to attach a perch, so I drilled a 5/16 inch hole through the white piece of plastic on top of the cupola.  I then stuck a 4 foot dowel through the hole for a perfect perch.  The pole certainly isn't worth it's price and the not so Easy Key Lock can be difficult, but a hammer fixed that.... The last thing I did was install a little bracket on the pole at the bottom of the house.  This provides added security to prevent the house from sliding down the pole.  All in All, I can't stop looking my new house."
5.0,"This thing is a time/life saver.  mailboxes, fences anything you need to dig a hole for.  Very quick."
5.0,"This is the only thing that has worked in my hard rock clay soil.  I am using the word ""soil"" loosely here, because i should probably harvest this stuff and make some pottery, lol.  The wetter, the better, and the clay fills the tool, and then you pull it up and dump it.  It takes some muscle, but one person should be able to dig at least the length of the tool.  If you add extensions, you may need help, because i would imagine it gets heavier, the deeper you dig.

I am going about 24"" to 30"" deep.  It takes about 15 min to go down 20"" to 24"".  That is very fast, compared to the shovel.  And the clam shell is useless in this clay, i didn't even bother trying that.  A motor driven auger would be faster, easier, but more expensive, and i don't mind the work.  I have about 20 4""x4"" posts to bury.  And the 8"" setting is a little small, so i am using a spade shovel to expand the hole to 10"" to 11"" inches.  This one was the biggest auger that i could easily find, but I would recommend a 10"" if you can find one for post hole digging.  Someone else claimed, their holes ended up being 10"" wide, but for this clay, the hole is the size of the auger setting.

CONS:  Grass clogs it, so dig that top off first.
  Roots?  I haven't hit any, but it's not going to go through them.
  Small rocks, or ""rock like"" clay can wedge in the end of the tool and clog it also, but you will realize, when there's no resistance.
  You have to push down and turn it!  Sometimes pushing down harder, other times, it pulls itself into the ground.
  No magical rock splitting action.  (Get in there with a spade shovel (works for me) or if you need the beast... use a long ""chisel bar"", aka ""spud bar"", ""digging bar"", sometimes called ""crowbar"")"

5.0,"I only dig holes once every several years, but THIS is the tool to do it with. It arrived in perfect condition and will come in handy for a great many years to come."
5.0,"Dug my fence post holes with this.  These things are awsome, don't know why Home improvement stores won't carry them, so much better than the toothpickers they sell.  I was worried that being adjustable would make the digging end flimsy but nope, thing works like a champ."
5.0,I used it to dig 30 holes through rocky soil. It is easier to use than a power auger which you have to continually lift out of the hole to clear the stones.
5.0,"This thing is great. My dad had an older different model that 'disappeared' and I've been looking for years. Got mine and it works outstanding in sand and clay mix (loose caliche) here in Arizona. Surprisingly fast, nice neat holes. When in rock and stone mix much more painful to use, but still often the best way to go. Not recommended for soil dense-packed with river rock or even smaller stones. But as long as you are about 75% soil and 25% small (<3"") rock, it works fine."
5.0,"Great, dug 17 post holes in a short time."
3.0,"I ordered a 4 story house.  I put it together alone and had no problems understanding the instructions... Took a long time but I had fun with it!  I did put on gloves, no biggie, the edges are sharp.
I bought it because it's inexpensive.  You get what you pay for the better units are $400.00+.  Would I buy it again, yes because that's what I can afford and all the inconveniences have to be dealt with.  If you can afford a better one get one, but this is much better than none, I love the Martins.
The problems with this house are many.
1) You can clean it only by lifting the layers off and reaching inside thru the tops.  You should not do this while the Martins are around.  So I end up bringing it to the ground and using a shop vac in each hole that contains an unwanted nest. If there's a better way, I can't find it and have spent lots of time working with it.
2) The depth of the nests make it easy for predators to stick their heads in and pull out babies. I'm looking into using some welded wire for predator guards but the house looks beautiful as it is and I don't want to ruin the look. I'm rural and can shoot into the ground to scare off hawks, if I was in town and couldn't shoot, I'd have to get predator guards on right now.
3) The telescoping pole SUCKS big time, we made an offset winch system that was expensive and time consuming.  Don't try it if you don't have welding equipment.
4)Maybe I'm dim but I can't find accessories for this unit.  I'd like a hex perch for the top, predator guards and starling proof door kits.  Can't find them anywhere.  Also, my sparrow traps do not fit."
4.0,"One you get it put together, It is a good house.  A bit of patience is required to get there however..."
3.0,"Beautiful to look at; however, I gave it a poor grade because of the difficulty we had in putting it together. The pieces did not line up well and my husband had to redrill holes to make it fit securely."
3.0,"I received this item within a week or so, but there were so many parts, nuts, bolts and screws, that I had to pay someone to assemble it. It would have taken me hours, so I found a person who did it for ten bucks-still worth it-nice purple martin house. JMS"
2.0,Not to mention razor sharp edges. Horrible instructions. The Martins love this style house and after our first house (we got already assembled from a friend) got damaged in a wind storm we decided to get a larger house. Wow just too much work.
1.0,This product isof poor quality.  I purchased because of precious ownership.  I would be suprised if it will last 3 years.  I do not recommend this birdhouse.
3.0,"I love the looks of the house.  It is too late this season to attract the purple martins, so I don't know if they will like it next year.  The biggest problem with this is building it.  It took me 8 hours to put it together.  (I do have long nails and I was doing it myself)  If I could have purchased this already put together, I would have paid an extra $50.00 for it.  It would have been worth it."
1.0,It took us more than 4 hours to put this house together. Design seems to have been done in the 1950s rather than 21st century. Instructions were absolutely hopeless. And don't try to put this together yourself -- you need at least two people.  The steel pole that we bought with this martin house also has hopeless instructions and the locking device is ridiculous.  The only way we can stop the pole from collapsing in a high wind is to put duct tape around each joint. We would definitely not buy this product again.  We are keeping our fingers croosed that it will survive the next high wind
2.0,"Product was time consuming to put together and did not fit snuggly together (lots of gaps in the flooring between rooms). The aluminum was extremely easy to bend, especially when trying to attach the railing, which does not stay in well. I will be searching for one better made. If it wasn't so... time consuming to put together, I would have taking apart and returned."
2.0,"I did not see anywhere on the box where assembly was required. The house is made up of about 72 seperate sections you put together with hundred of tiny nuts and bolts in tight corners. Can you say Erector set? Of course, they include three warnings that all the metal pieces are sharp and they are, so be careful! I sat in front of the television watching the football game while assembling. Directions were ok, but could have been much better. I did have to backtrack and fix some things before getting into a rythmn and doing it on my own. Definitely not for someone that might have a hard time with assembly."
5.0,"This Ax is not just for campers.  I bought it to use around my yard and so far it works perfect for my use.  It is not heavy so I do not tire as quickly and I can work longer on the task than if I use a heavier ax that will tired me faster.  Not bad, not bad at all.  I like to take care of my tools, so I know it will last me a very long time with good care."
5.0,"gives the feeling of being indestructible, is made in a single piece of steel very very reliable and very good edge grabs"
5.0,Very good quality. So light it is easy to use with one hand cutting limbs. Sharpens well and holds an edge well. It is indestructible.
5.0,Worked great and has good balance. Just enough weight in the head to cut good but not so much to wear you out.
5.0,"Best limbing and small tree felling axe i've ever owned. You can get it hair shaving sharp if you want very easy. It can also double as a great zombie tool, if you're into that."
5.0,"I split large (18"" to 32"" diameter) oak wood sections into quads, in order to lift them onto my logspliter.  I use this axe as my primary wedge, opening a gap large enough to accomodate my wedges.  This is my second purchase of this axe"
5.0,"I new Estwing made good hammers but this axe is pretty much unbreakable and easy to handle.
I would recommend this product."
5.0,"I brought it more to look at then work with I want to mount it to my
Side by side Polaris Ranger just for looks. I have used one of these Axes
and they do a great job cutting braches for hunting."
5.0,"This is my wifes sight.
I've owned this little axe for over 30 years, it just works better than anything I've ever found for limbing trees when cutting firewood. The hollow ground face allows it to bite deeper than an axe of comparable size. I have taken it to the mountains,the far north, the deserts of the west and the hard wood forests of the south. It has cut wood ,roots and miles of brushy fence rows. It has processed wild game and cut wood for campfires.
I wouldn't go camping without it"
5.0,"By far one of the best camp axes I've ever owned. made in America! built to last! Don't hesitate to buy this ax if your in the market, Estwing is the best."
5.0,Very good
5.0,"Excellent post hole digger. The only thing I did different was that I secured the handle using a exterior grade stainless steel coated deck screw. the handle comes with this small nail to use, but it seemed like it would back out. By loosening a large nut, you can remove the large bolt and adjust out the blades for a maximum hole of almost 8"". It says 6-8"" but it is more like 5.5 to 7.5"". I was still able to dig a 7.5"" hole 48"" deep in about 15 minutes using it allowing me to secure a 6x6 treated timber into the ground. My ground is a mix of sandy soil with some clay. Those with all clay will still be able to use it, just might take longer to dig hole. I searched all the local big box store (lowes, HD, Menards, etc.) and even TSC and all these places carry now is the crappy paddle style post hole diggers that are worthless. Glad I found this on Amazon. Not sure why it is discontinued, but grab one if you need one, you won't be sorry. It comes in a single box from amazon and already assembled, other than installing the handle. The handle only goes in one way into the stem. It is tapered so put the tapered end in one side and gently tap with a rubber mallot until it is centered. Then secure with either the nail or a screw like I did. You will see in the top center of the stem a small hole where to secure it. Awesome auger styled post hole digger that works exceptionally well."
5.0,"This thing saved my back while I saw digging fence posts.  Could use a slightly longer shaft, but still great!"
5.0,"UNBELIEVABLY GREAT, don't know why I ever bothered to try digging so much with 2 handled post hole diggers! Thinking about trying to dig a shallow well under 32 feet with it."
4.0,This auger works fairly well.  It is a bit tough to use in rocky or very stoney soil; but what isn't?
5.0,"After trying to use the other kind of post hole clamshell digger, I had the opportunity to one like this and it makes digging a hole for fence posts a whole lot easier. We bought our own digger(this one)promptly. I highly recommend this for making all the holes you could want to make in your yard."
4.0,Be ready to labor with this device.
5.0,VERY GOOD PRODUCT. STRONG
5.0,"SO much easier than the clamshell diggers, makes digging holes a breeze and the adjustable feature is great!"
5.0,"I have a one-man gas powered auger I use for post holes and sometimes plants, but my soil is rife with hardpan and rocks - works fine for a while, but if I hit a substantial submerged rock, the blade which makes it cut into the ground gets blunted and the thing doesnt want to dig anymore until I sit down and sharpen it...  It's a huge pain.

Now, this manual auger is obviously on average slower to dig than the powered one, but clay and rocks don't slow me down at all (though it could be said that some specific holes are dug faster than with my power auger) - my arms provide plenty of torque and the blades cut into the ground perfectly, and of course since my arms aren't turning it at some ridiculous RPM, if I hit a big rock, I simply stop turning and deal with the stone with my geo pick.  Seriously, I look forward to digging post holes now that I have this in my arsenal.  Looks like it can be easily extended to make a deeper hole as well via the theaded end."
5.0,My husband bought this auger and has holes dug in less than a minute through clay.  It is amazing!  Way better than a regular post hole digger.
5.0,So much better than the old post hole digger that you stabbed into the ground and only got a frustratingly little handful of dirt out.  This thing flies through the dirt.  Even slightly rocky dirt.  I'd imagine you'd run into trouble if you hit a large rock.  Watch videos of people digging their own illegal wells with this baby!
5.0,This is a great tool. It works much more efficiently than a clamshell digger.
2.0,Used a few times - strap that hold two of the blades together broke.  No longer functional.  Poor design.
5.0,"This post-hole digger is great.  I was using the other kind that you  have to push down, pull apart, pull up.  That was a slow process.  This digger digs down with much greater ease because of the twisting action."
5.0,"This auger is made from high quality material and is much easier to use than the clam shell post hole diggers. The auger cuts through soil and clay with no problem. I am able to dig 2 foot deep holes for 4x4 post in about 5-7 minutes easily. The only issue is the soil stays within the auger, making it somewhat difficult to empty if the soil or clay is wet."
5.0,I use mine for digging wells.  I use 3/4 black pipe for extensions.  I have dug down 15 feet using the auger in clay and sand.  Nice well made tool.
5.0,Well made tool. Works great. Not sure ir would work as well in rock.
4.0,Seems to be well built not used yet.
4.0,"Works pretty darn well, and is well worth the price.

Yes, it goes through hard-packed dry clay, infinitely better than a shovel (or a pick), but I won't pretend it's just as easy as most other soils.  But this thing is certainly much easier on the back than swinging a pick to get through clay.

On dry and sandy soil, it tends to all fall out when you try to lift up the auger, so you'll find yourself switching between this and a shovel for removal.  Wetting the area helps, but not dramatically.  It's still an issue that you'll have to fight with.

But what really cripples this auger are larger stones.  Get up to about 3"" stones, and the blade of this auger will just keep scraping the top of them, never dig any further, and really never dislodge them, so you'll have to switch over to a shovel, pick, or similar.  Sometimes you can lift the stone out with your bare hands, that stopped this auger dead in it's tracks.

A redesign that holds-in loose soil, and much more effectively dislodges stones, would be very welcome.  But, I'm still quite happy with it, and it saves much work either for digging post holes, or helping out with tough spots on other digging tasks."
4.0,It came very sharp but it was a little smaller than I was expecting. but i did like it.ok.xx xx
5.0,"Somewhere between a camp/belt Axe & a ""real Axe""
Not for major cutting, not enough mass/inertia for sustained use.
Great for canoing, 4 wheeling, snowmobiling, dog sledding.

For big tree felling (alone) without a chainsaw, get a Kelly Woodslasher!"
5.0,"arrived sharp and ready to work, holds a nice edge. it is everything that is expected from the estwing company."
5.0,"My son is the one who loves it!  It was a fun Christmas gift, especially getting it disguised in the wrapping!"
5.0,Super Axe is what it should be Called ! Greatest Short Axe in the World to me ! Comes ready to do anything you want to with a peace of wood . I chopped down a dead tree and chopped and trimmed at every thing at the house and at camp.
5.0,"This axe is so well made, light weight and strong, it would be great for any one to use, even small women, which I am.  It's all one solid piece of steel and the longer handle makes it so easy to cut wood.  Excellent product!"
5.0,"Sturdy and light weight, all-metal construction. I couldn't ask for a better product. Thank you from one American to another!"
5.0,"The Estwing campers axe is made in the USA, entirely of metal, ie; the handle and axe head are forged together as one unit. The steel is high quality, and the rubberized handle is shock absorbent and firmly affixed to the handle.
 Recommended by friends of mine, this is the best axe/hatchet line on the market in my opinion."
5.0,"I love this ax. I bought it to carry on a pack while backpacking and to take on hunting and camping trips. My dad has had this Ax for the same purposes for years now. It has yet to wear out, just keep it sharp and it will last forever. I have never been able to break this thing, and trust me, i have tried. Ive used it to take the antlers off moose and caribou, hit rocks with it in the process, The blade stays sharp for quite a while even with that abuse."
5.0,"Holds a good edge. I really like the one-piece handle-head, virtually indestructable, hold a good edge for a long time. I highly recommend it, a once in a lifetime ax purchase. With just minimal care it should outlast your grandchildren."
5.0,"Great post hole digger, easy on the back"
5.0,"Easiest manual auger EVER.  I dug a foot deep hole to plant a small tree in TWO minutes.  Could've kept right on digging to 2 ft for my fence posts (which is what I bought it for but I haven't purchased the cement yet).  But I can already see it's going to be absolutely no problem and I'm only 5' 4"", 126 lbs, WITH a heart condition!  VERY impressed."
5.0,"Very very fast shipping, well built auger"
5.0,"superb product.  I removed the long handle and used iron gas pipe connected with electrical unions, both from Home Depot, to go 40ft deep.  Easy.  Great product."
5.0,I was a little dubious about this item but took a chance.  I've dug hundreds of post holes using the old style clam digger but they are a pain in clay but these really do the trick.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"Heavy duty, dug a shallow well with it by adding some threaded 3/4"" pipe to the handle."
5.0,"Works great.  Some reviewers complained that it performed poorly in rocky soil.  I found it no worse in rocky soil than traditional post hole diggers, but much easier to use."
4.0,"Very useful tool.

We originally purchased it to build a fence but found other purpose for it.
We used it to plant flower and trees on our yard."
5.0,My husband raved about this the first time he used it to dig holes for tree planting.
4.0,You just gotta try these. Its a whole lot easier than those post hole diggers you have to lift and jam lift and jam... these are much easier.
5.0,Very easy to use especially when the job requires a long period of time to complete. Extending my backyard fence a few post a day at a time. I didn't want to rent (extended amount of time) nor buy a post hole digger. Worked out great. Dug 2.5 to 3 ft holes easily. I beleive it was about 30 posts.
4.0,works well drops sand when you hit water
5.0,"If this isn't Amazon's best kept secret in tools, then I don't know what is.  This tool is AWESOME.  I am contemplating buying another one or two to give as gifts, it's that good.

Since becoming a homeowner over 20 years ago, I have manually dug many post holes with shovels, clam shell diggers and digging bars.  Wish I had known about this auger all along.  The bottom line is that it works.  Today I tried it out for the first time and in 10 minutes created a **perfect** 8"" diameter hole that was 36"" deep.  Are you kidding me?  That is unreal.  My soil contains just a bit of clay and, of course, some rocks, and this auger did the job.  I then went on to dig the additional post holes needed and each of those holes also took about 10 minutes to create.  A quick rotation or two of the handle fills the auger blades with soil, which then can be lifted up and ""dumped"" aside.  Simple.  Effective.  Oh, and I did not even get dirty -- what a nice change!

I can't recall when I have been this excited about a tool.  All those years spent busting my knuckles with a clam shell digger and creating holes larger in diameter than necessary are now history...gone...poof.

Don't know why the manufacturer lists this tool as having been discontinued.  With proper marketing they could sell enough to employ allot of people in manufacturing and to make allot of end-users very happy.

Highly recommend."
5.0,"Best manual post hole digger around.  I'm so sorry to read this manufacturer has discontinued.  I found mine at a local farm and home store for $55 and was thrilled to get it.  Holes are straight and goes down to 3' very quick compared to the the traditional post hole digger.  It is much easier for an older person to use.  Only challenge is same for all diggers, rocks under the ground.  I whipped through some hard clay pretty easily and was absolutely blow away at the ease.  I will sell my other post hole digger and not miss them.  I did keep a screw driver in the back pocket when dumping the dirt in case any got stuck in the blades.  It was not necessary very often, but when there is grass in the beginning, that can get stuck in the clay a little more firm than once you get out of the grass zone.

I did not have any issues with the fit of the wood handle.  I actually did not secure it because I'm digging a hole next to an existing fence and I wanted to be able to move it out of the way when I twist to that side.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this digger.  Much safer for me than a gas powered auger would have been.  (I'm female about 5'6; 52 years of age)."
5.0,exactly what I wanted
5.0,"Throw out the old pincher-type. This is the way post hole diggers are meant to work. Wore myself out trying to dig deck post holes in our Sierra Foothills decomposed granite. After this tool arrived, I dug holes in minutes."
5.0,"Fantastic tool.  Adjusted it to fit an 8"" cylinder and put it to work.  I was digging in sandy, rocky, debris ridden soil.  In no time, I had a three foot cylindrical hole.  It is SO much easier than using a clamshell.  I broke out the clamshell just to compare.  The clamshell would have taken three times as long and I would have been worn out because it removes 1/2 the amount of soil compared to the Seymour Auger.  And the work motion of the clamshell requires so much more effort.  Saves your back and save your time.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"I've only used clam-shell style diggers before, and this is--without question--so much easier, precise & easy on the body/back.  No more slamming the clam-shell blades down & awkwardly separating your arms to grab a small amount of dirt to create an uneven, poor-looking post hole.  This twist style auger provided an incredibly precise and consistent post hole just by twisting the handle.  Must buy for those considering a hand-based auger."
5.0,Works perfectly.  I was able to dig a shallow water well.
4.0,"Very easy to use.  Havent figured out the hole size adjustment, but it came set for what I needed.  Rips through the ground very easy."
5.0,"I actually thought this would be a full sized axe. That was my mistake, for not reading the description more carefully. However, I kept it, and used it to cut down several trees, ranging from 6-15"" in diameter. I also used it to cut them up into smaller pieces and split some of them.

This axe works great. It works as good as some larger axes, and better than any camp axe I've ever used. My dog ate the leather case, which was apparently as delicious as at looked. The grip is very comfortable, absorbs the shock well, and lets me have a firm hold with confidence while swinging.

If I decide to ever get a larger axe, it will definitely be from this company. They make a very good product."
5.0,"Estwing makes some great products and I like them.  Hatchets to hammers, and now this wonderful 26 inch camp axe with leather snapped axe head cover.  At four pounds it's heavy enough to do some good chopping, great in the log woods for trimming or the other place we use it campfires, just a nice piece of hardware and no wood handle to break, it just keeps on going.  I bought two for my boys and had their names engraved.  They may have been seconds, as they were painted gray?  The engraving was shallow and hasn't held up.  I just ordered another for my nephew and on his I will use my letter stamps and do it myself.  Probably put his birth date on it too, as it's coming up.  A nice reminder of a day someone gave you a stellar hand tool.  You know, I'm gonna order another as I don't have one myself.  Thanks Amazon for the free shipping, you are my hardware store via my credit card and UPS truck!  Go ahead and buy it, it does the job and you will be happy to own it.  I love the cover, never used it strapped on my belt, but It protects the blade and user during transport and storage.  This needs to be hung up or shelved.  We got one wet leaned up in the garage and it wasn't good on the leather cover, still works but it's best not to get it wet.  Cheers. bd"
5.0,"I got the Estwing E-45A Campers axe a couple days ago and I am very pleased with what I received.  The axe was on backorder for a couple weeks but I was informed of the status of my order several times during my wait.  I am very glad I purchased this axe.  I have used a half axe about this size about 45 years ago and found them very handy when camping and at Boy Scout Camp. Full sized axes were just too big for most scouts.  If they used them they worked themselves to death and would stop.  Then you couldn't get them to help again.  Of course this was when scouts could use axes and sheath knives.  I still have a couple full size axes but wanted to see if these were still as easy to use as I remember.  This is a great tool and is of the highest quality.

First, the sheath is old school and made of beautiful thick tooled leather.  The sheath is heavily stitched and has strong rivets and double snaps.  The fit is snug and a very safe way to transport the axe.  It is well tanned but was a little dry so the first thing I did was to wipe it down with neatsfoot oil.  I recently saved a old leather sheath for a 18 "" machete that had been in a shed for twenty years with neatsfoot oil it took weeks but it is restored to almost perfect condition.  You don't see much neatsfoot oil around today.

The axe blade is beautiful and just the right size for my uses now. The edge was rolled a little when I checked it but with a few licks across a steel that was cleared up.  I can use this thing without killing myself.  I can even use it with one hand if need be.  The stainless was very smooth and well brushed to a medium shine.  The shaft appear to go all the way through the handle.  I can't guarantie that it goes all the way through the handle but if is like several of my other Estwing tools it does.  The grip is designed to absorb vibrations and does so very well.  If it last as well as my others I will be passing this down to my grandson with the other Estwing tools.

I would not carry this if I was backpacking but think it will be the best general camp tool that you can have if you like an evening fire.  Now if I was in a Zombie invasion I think this would just about be the perfect tool/weapon.  It has enough wight to pierce a skull but not so much weight to cause you to over swing wasting time and energy.

I would recommend this axe from this dealer in a skinny minute and if I needed another I would have no second thoughts about its quality.  I Highly Recommend This Axe

5.0,Best little axe you could ask for.  We have 8 acres of timber land in Washington State.  This little axe is perfect for limbing trees and light duty wood cutting.  The quality is incredible.
5.0,I have always wanted one. They made me an offer I could not refuse. A nicely balanced beautiful tool. The grip is great.
5.0,"Gave one to my son years ago and always wanted one for myself. After numerous hints went unheeded, I figured that if I wanted one I would have to ""gift"" myself. Not sorry I did. the thing is bullet proof and extremely handy to have around,"
2.0,"To me this is a mediocre axe.  Not very heavy, not very sharp, not very balanced, not all that easy to use.  A sort of weak compromise among various qualities you want in an axe.  It may be good for camping, but for general purposes, I can't recommend it."
2.0,"The only problem with this axe is that the top blue part of the handle is hollow, so it could and will break easily."
5.0,"Got this for my birthday. The leather sheath is solid and up to the challenge of housing and protecting a serious chopper for a lifetime. Although I've been into smaller knives like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schrade-SHD1-8-Fix-Blade-Knife-with-Stag-Handle-and-Leather-Sheath/dp/B0017UWXXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schrade SHD1 8"" Fix Blade Knife with Stag Handle and Leather Sheath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wenger-Highlander-Genuine-Swiss-Army-Knife/dp/B000LHBSTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wenger Highlander Genuine Swiss Army Knife</a>&nbsp;and using hatchets for wood processing, this axe is a one hungry beast! Capable of more than its size would indicate. Although I swung very close to the ground and focused more on accuracy than power, it only took a dozen swings to topple a 4"" unwanted tree too close to the garage!

Even though I swung more for accuracy than power about 1/3 of the swings stuck so deep into the wood I could not get it out without torquing the axe. I cannot wait to swing away to see what this great, great tool is capable of. There are a few 8-10"" fallen trees out in the back woods. I suspect a lifetime of impressive performance from yet another outstanding Estwing product.

UPDATE: I took out several 6-8"" trees. With a very excellent bow saw it took me 20 minutes and my arm and shoulder we very fatigued. I tried this out. I chopped the same tree in less than 6 minutes! After only a few chops I was 1/3 done and not even needing a break. What an excellent chopping tool!"
4.0,I received this in NZ in a week.  It is a good value for money multi purpose axe.  Shame I can't get other axes sent to NZ.
5.0,Great adjustable tool!
5.0,"Took a bit to get used to operation.  If the ground is soft enough to get this into it works great.  Put in posts for a fenced in back yard.  Found running some water in the hole helps if dirt is really dry.

I have used the ole pinch style post hole digger for hundreds of holes in the past.  This is way easier.

Hitting rocks in the soil can be a pain to deal with but so is any hand digger."
5.0,"Worked like a champ, its a solid tool and is worth every penny."
5.0,Great for digging holes by hand.  Quick and easy and you don't have to be really strong.  Worth every penny.  Much better than the regular hand hole diggers.
4.0,"I gave this product four stars only because it says it's adjustable, but there are no adjustable features on it. The auger is riveted to the six inch hole. That being said, I just dug 4 holes 18-24"" deep today without even breaking a sweat. I have clay that's heavy with rocks, digging was very easy with a little help from a digging bar. I would only ever use my clam shells again if I needed a wider hole. I'm very satisfied with the product, I just wish it was adjustable."
5.0,yay
5.0,This works very well at digging deep post-holes very quickly with not much effort. It also works well to start planting holes for trees. We found it to be a lot easier and faster to use than a traditional post-hole digger.
5.0,"Had to install a new mailbox post and was not looking forward to digging the post hole.  Used this, and a True Temper 69-inch post hole digging bar for a few roots.  Went 28 inches down through a bit of clay very easily and quickly.  Hardest part of the job was screwing on the handle.  The handle is made of super hard wood and it was difficult to drive the screw into the wood.  But would rather have this strong handle than a lower quality piece of wood.  Plan to use this again for preparing holes for some bare root fruit trees to be delivered in January.  Would buy again."
5.0,"Where were these when I was using traditional post hole diggers? These are really great, and will change your life if you have a large project requiring many post holes to be dug. great buy"
5.0,set a lot of fence with this
4.0,"I've had the ax for about two months. In that time I've chopped about a 30 year old cedar's worth of wood. It does well with chopping, cutting, and spitting. I've used it in weather above about 35 degrees. I've heard that in fairly cold weather the metal is prone to cracking but I've used my 31 year old Estwing hammer in the blistering cold without problem so I would imagine it will perform as usual. It keeps it's edge well and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, all purpose ax. My only problem with it is the the lanyard holes cut in the handle material are blocked by the tang of the metal. I suppose  it's good to know that it goes all the way through but it was none the less annoying. It was easily fixed with a 1/4 inch bit and a file."
5.0,I actually purchased my son this axe because he was a conselor at a Boy Scout camp last summer.  He took it up to camp this summer and he just loved it.  It came out very sharp and ready to use.  He stated that he could cut twice the amount of wood in half the time than when he was using the camps axe.  Now I can't wait to try it out myself
5.0,Beautiful workmanship. Extremely sturdy. Really a mini-axe (26 inches overall length) so can be used as a hatchet or an axe. Head and handle are one piece of metal. I'm using mine to chop out small maple stumps one root at a time. I broke four hatchets before I manned up and bought this tool. Was so attractive coming out of the box I hated to start to use it. Might be the best tool purchase I ever made (and I'm not exaggerating). Estwing also makes a hatchet version if that's what you need.
4.0,"While it is a well made Axe, the handle near the blade is thin, so any heavy duty chopping you want to do with it is out the window. It is great for light chopping though."
5.0,"I purchased one of these axes back in 2006 and have used it heavaly since.  First thing to note is that the blade is thiner that other axes this allows much deeper cuts than would be normaly possibe for a medium sised axe. If you have a strong practiced swing, a 5 inch tree can be felled in two whacks. I have tackled trees up to 3 feet in diameter. It does take more time that a full sise logging axe but the task is not much more dificlt than it would be normaly, thanks to the light weight and powerful cutting blade. The steel is very high quality and dulls slowly. I have only had to sharpen mine 2 times in 6 years.(both times after overcutting into rocks or metal)  As with all axes I own I throw this axe. It rotates well and will hold up to the fource of bad hits. occationaly the shaft just below the head will bend slighlty if the impact (when thrown) is very severe. IE hitting a log sidewase half way down the handle. but just take it whack it on the same objet in the other direction and it straightens right back out.  I have Abused this axe severly in the last year or so because I want a prettier one.(mine is very scrached and stained). I CANNOT break it.  I have managed to get the bottom of the soft rubber handle to come appart from it hitting trees and targets handle first but nothing else has broken.  The Blade will Nick and flatten if you hit rocks or metal but cleans up nicly on a grinder or with a dremmle. Once again I have SEVERLY abused this ax and it still cuts superbly swings in ballance and feels as solid as the day I bought it.

Getting a new one this week because I just can't break the old one."
5.0,"This axe is NICE! Yes, mine does have a couple small cosmetic imperfection on the clear coat, but really who cares? This thing is for brawny wood cutting, not winning beauty contests...although it is pretty sexy as axes go, ha-ha. The handle grip is fantastically firm, yet supple, and it has plenty of room for two handed swinging. It's a nice middle ground between a hatchet and a full sized axe. Unless you are really tight on space, I would opt for this axe over the 16"" version because the slight weight increase is worth it for the extra length. The axe feels very balanced and easily controlled during the swing and it cuts through wood as nicely as I had hoped. Overall I'm very pleased!"
1.0,"This has cracks at thinnest part behind blade. This not a second, it is dangerous and an outright reject that should have not left the factory."
3.0,"it is a nice balanced axe.  it swings nice.  it has a good flow to it.  with little trouble i was able to fell a 8"" diameter trunk in about 5 minutes.  but, i can see inconsistencies in the metal and some roughness to the grip (like those in the pics).  makes you think that quality control is slipping in american plants.  i did make contact on one swing that vibrated the axe so badly that it made me stop and inspect it.  it was an uneasy feeling.  but if this tool is used with respect and knowledge and not treated like a toy it could last a few years.  not nearly as long as my estwing hammer that i received from my dad 15 years ago.  he had it since the 70s and i still use it to this day."
5.0,"I first learned about this particular axe as we used it exclusively in my Boyscout Troop back in the mid to late '70's.  Even as a child I recognized a superbly engineered tool. In the early '90's, I bought one for myself.  I've been chopping with it ever since.  The last year or so on a small, 44-acre farm.  It is quite simply as fine an axe as you can buy at any price.  It combines excellent ergonomics, handle comfort, balance, speed, low weight, reliability and sheer cutting power into a tool that will last your lifetime and then some."
5.0,"On a recent camping trip my friend brought this axe and we not only cut up massive amounts of firewood but discovered that it is a great throwing toy as well.  we had an axe-throwing contest for a solid three hours.  This thing is as solid as they come, no damage to it was realized.

anyway, since that trip, i had to have one.  i just bought it and have used it to chop up all kinds of firewood for the house and can't wait to go camping again to create some more good times."
5.0,"You can add 3/4"" pipe to extend the auger down as far down as you can lift it back up with a load of dirt until you hit the water table. I'm using it to drill a well for irrigation, water table is about 20' where I live, I dug an 8"" hole ten foot down in about an hour and a half and cased it. I'll go the rest of the way with 4"" casing to the water table. Works great in my soil which is mostly clay, this would work well for fence posts as well, much easier then post hole diggers."
5.0,"The auger is as good as the ones I used fixing fences 50 years ago. It did a great job in a short time,even with an old guy using it.  I expected the wooden handle to be rough and not fit after reading the reviews.  Not so.  My handle was very nice and fit fine."
5.0,"Better than ANY ""post-hole"" digger! Nice!"
2.0,"For me, it didn't do much.  I have very rocky clay that I call ""soil"" and the auger didn't make a dent in it.  Could be there's some trick to it that I didn't try, but I twisted, pushed, pulled, and swore prolifically so I don't know what else I could have done.

If it had dug in, I'm not sure how I would have gotten the dirt out.  It looks like the dirt would fall out of the sides and bottom."
5.0,This is a great tool.  Well made and easy to use (on sandy soil).
5.0,"Excellent post hole digger.  I dug a well with it using 3/4"" black iron pipe extensions. Does the job."
5.0,Excellent product. Performs as expected. No negative comments at all.
5.0,"My husband extended it with 3/4"" pipe, to get the depth he needed"
5.0,Very solid. Would perform well in heavy clay soil arreas.
5.0,"Built very good. should last for years, And just what I wanted."
5.0,This thing cuts through trees like butter.  I've taken down numerous 6 inch trunk trees in a matter of minutes.  Outstanding craftsmanship and quality.  I am so glad I decided on Estwing.
5.0,"I've owned this axe for 2 years now.  I've used it on numerous occasions.

Pros:
Lightweight
Holds an edge well
Easy to sharpen
Light weight
Solid, one piece construction ensures that the head will not slip

Cons:
None

I expect to be passing this axe down down in the family."
5.0,I was just outside using this axe. Mine came from Home Depot & has a sheath. It's highly controlable. Give it some ooompf & it will chop!
5.0,"This axe comes sharp and ready to use! Great for splitting fireplace sized logs and for kindling! Light, good grip and superb for camping! A must own for anyone that chops their own wood!"
5.0,"Best ax for the money I can find. Its weight is in the head, which makes it swing nicely. The solid metal construction should make it durable. I haven't had long enough to give it a true long term test"
5.0,"Once I got this axe home I gave it a good working on the dry/wet stones and a final with a leather strop. The edge was kind of boogered up, QC must have been at lunch ;) I went out to the woods to work on a downed birch tree. I was cutting through regular grain wood as well as knots that I would normally avoid. The knots dulled the edge as expected, but did not chip or roll, and the edge came back pretty easy so I continued on to work. The rubber covered handle is comfortable and secure, even when wet. A few of my friends carry axes from Sweden, and they are fine tools, but I offered to let my buddies give my 45a a work out. They did not hold back, swing after swing, they tried to show a flaw , and in the end  my friends were considering on how much they spent v.s what I spent. All I did was smile."
5.0,I bought this axe to cut up some rounds I had. It performed very well. I would buy it again.
3.0,"I own 2 other axes, one is a log splitter the other a hatchet. This one is a chopper. I bought the 26"" handle axe. Found the axe by accident looking for a pry bar in the hand tool section. I don't know why it is not in the lawn and garden section with every other axe in the store. Did not know Estwing made an axe, and apparently this one has been around for a while. It was priced as good as I could find it on the internet. I was looking at the gerber and fiskar axes and thinking about the x15 from fiskars until I picked this up. The axe is ""Mr Destructo"".
  I like the 1 piece solid steel construction. I think it comes all the way down the handle which is rubber coated and the leather sheath has slits on the back to strap it to a pack. If you are tall you could carry it on your belt I guess. Besides getting fire wood this axe will chop down doors. If your house is not made of brick you could probably chop your way in or out of an exterior wall.
 I did read some of the reviews here and read some of the complaints about inconsistant quality, and inspected 8 different makes of this axe and chose the cleanest one. After looking at the imperfections on some of these axes, I don't think it was from the manufacturing part of estwing but maybe how the axes were being stored at the store or in the way the axes were shipped. I also do not think the small nicks and scratches would have effected the performance of the axe either. I believe the actual blade is wider than the others.
Update- I would not purchase this axe if you are planning to split thick logs or try to carry it into the woods. This axe is great for demo work and smaller tree stuff but it does not compare well to a real forged axe head with a hickory handle if considering to carry into the woods. The axe is great if you are working on trees or logs thinner than the blades edge and great for anything 3 inches thick or less. But If you go thicker than the blades edge it gets stuck a lot. Getting more axe experience, learning and developing more skills I now know why people spend the money on these Swedish axes.  The blade on this estwing from the edge to about the middle does not widen fast enough or does not have the right pitch. The blade digs deep, maybe too deep for it's own good and gets stuck often. On the Husqvarna forest axe that I bought, the blade gets thicker quicker so it does much more damage when striking and the tree or log and it does not squeeze back on the blade. Also I can get my hands really close to the bottom of the blade to do feathering or scraping work. The Husqvarna forest axe is what I bought to carry. Has the same length from top to bottom and was only 65 bucks. It is also lighter and you will use less energy with it than this axe to get more work done. Hard to find. it would still be worth it to buy a wetterlings or a granfors bruks. These are considered proper axes and have been used forever for good reason."
5.0,"When this axe arrived to my house I was a little disapointed in how small it was.  Once i started swinging it, I instantly fell in love.  I had about 3,000 large tree branches fall down in my yard due to a freak noreaster that hit Connecticut in late October.  I cleaned out my entire yard with this small axe in one afternoon."
5.0,"I heat with wood and needed another replacement handle for my axe, so I decided to look at this instead. After using a 36"" handle I wondered how I would like the shorter length, but I knew that I'd be happy with the Estwing design as I've used their hammers for many years. I've now had it for a few days and am using it to split wood into kindling. I am amazed at how nice this axe is, the quality of the materials and build, and how comfortable and well balanced it feels. The steel looks beautiful, the finish is perfect. It really makes the chore much easier than with my old wood-handled axe. Money well spent- and reinvested in the USA (except for the Haitian-assembled sheath)."
5.0,"This was used to dig post holes for 2 3/8"" metal fence posts down to roughly 24"".  I kept it at the 7"" (middle) setting, but going down to 6"" would have been just fine.  Though it takes longer than a powered auger, you have much less chance of this thing ripping your arms off! (if you have used a gasoline powered auger you know just what I mean!)

Pros:
Runs about the same price as renting a gasoline auger, but you get to keep this for future projects!
Very sturdy and cuts a nice clean hole.
Barring large rocks getting in the way, post holes can be dug to 24"" in a matter of minutes.

Cons:
The handle attachment method is rather poor.  You slide the handle in one side until it fits snugly in the metal sleeve (the wood is tapered).  Then you drive in a small (3/4"" or so) wood screw to keep it from sliding out.  In my case, the handle went well past 50% before fitting snugly in the sleeve, then the screw kept loosening in the hole, allowing the handle to develop a distracting amount of play.  It still got the job done, but was not ideal.  I plan to replace the screw with a larger one and perhaps add some shims to improve the fit of the handle.
Larger rocks and leftover cement (from previous posts) really throw a wrench in the works!  Plan to spend some time removing these if you have them in your soil.
More physical labor required than with a powered auger.

I gave this five stars despite the cons since they were expected.  The premium you pay for this over a scissor-type post hole digger is WELL worth it!"
5.0,"Works Awesome! Much easier on body compared to the old 'clam' style diggers. I bought a 3/4""x24"" pipe and a coupler to make it easier for going deeper. I would recommend buying the Tru Temper 69 post hole digging bar to go with this. It has been a life saver for popping rocks and cutting tree roots out that digger can't get."
5.0,"Outstanding product, way superior to the man killer!"
5.0,Works exceptionally.  The only way to dig a post hole without using a power auger.
5.0,"This is a very good and useful tool.  I used it to dig a 3 feet hole on my front yard to install a 4x4 for my new mailbox.  I tried using another tool before for another job, but the soil on my yard turned out to be full of various size rocks.  It was very hard to dig holes with another tool.  However, this particular tool was much easier to dig because it would catch the rocks and bring them up with the dirt.  I liked this tool a lot."
3.0,"I live on REALLY hard hardpan soil. This didn't make a dent. Seems to be a well made product, just wouldn't recommend it for hardpan soil."
5.0,Every thing it is supposed to be and at a good price. I'm sorry I waited so long to buy this!
5.0,"I used this product to dig my own well.  It is sturdy, versatile, and pulls up the cuttings out of the hole. In two days I dug 26 feet.  Having used post hole diggers, I can assure you this product would make short work of post holes.  Excellent made in the USA product!"
5.0,Works as advertised.  I added 5' of pipe and in a reasonable amount of time I had a 8 foot hole drilled in clay soil.
5.0,Best hole digger I ever used. You don't even need to turn it in full circles to work. Simply half turns and back it will dig nice.
5.0,"this timer is small and basic, but then all you really need to do is turn off the water... how many bells and whistles do you need to do the job??? bought a second one for the back faucet...great bang for the buck..."
5.0,"I prefer these timers over the more complex type because all I want one to do is to shut off the water after a certain amount of time.(This prevents me from forgetting to turn off the water!) It is so easy, the rest of the family , who are not as willing to mess with more technical timers, can operate it with ease."
1.0,"This is trash. Poorly made.
Doesn't work.

Spend more money, and get an electronic timer."
1.0,These timers do not last long and stop working. The company sent me replacements two separate times and they stopped working. I am on my third request for a replacement. Don't waste your money on this item.
1.0,as mentioned earlier. this thing is a piece of junk.  has gotten stuck 3 or 4 times and watered an area of my lawn ALL NIGHT.  have bought other gilmour products that ALSO ARE JUNK.
1.0,"It does not shut off.  I had the water on for hours when I had it set on 1 hour.  I had two of them.  One exploded.  The other I just tossed in the trash, not even worthy of freecycle."
1.0,"I purchased two of these at a local hardware superstore and brought both back a week later. Neither box had an instruction manual, but they seemed easy enough to operate. One of them would not shut off at all and the other would work when it wanted to. I needed a timer to back me up when I forget that the water is running, but these were not it. Don't waste your money."
5.0,"Edit 2016 Jun 02: Just found another handy use for this tool. I found a dead raccoon on the edge of my property. I grabbed the auger, set it's diameter to 10 inches, then dug a 4 foot hole. As I brought up dirt, I emptied the dirt into 5 gallon buckets. Then I dropped the raccoon into the hole using a shovel. Finally, I poured the dirt from the buckets back into the hole and tamped it down with an 8 inch tamper. The only evidence of all this was a nice, neat 10 inch circle of tamped dirt at the surface.

Original review:
Best pole hole digger I've ever used. Instead of lifting up and ramming down, I just twist. Almost effortless. Even better than those gasoline powered augers that you have to be Hercules to hold in position.

I just drilled a 5 foot hole in the ground. The diameter of the hole is 6 inches from top to bottom - no extra dirt to dig.

The cutter can be adjusted to cut up to 10 inch diameter holes.

The length of the handle can be increased by unthreaded provided handle from cutter blades and threading on a union and pipe length to handle, and threading handle back onto cutter blades. I use 2 foot sections of pipe to keep the handle wieldly.

One of those tool designs that is so simple and brilliant, it makes me wonder why someone didn't think of this a long time ago, and if they did, why aren't all other designs completely obsolete."
5.0,great post hole digger makes digging post holes easier!
5.0,"The item was shipped quickly.  I used this, as many others have, to dig a shallow well.  The auger worked flawlessly!  I was able to go 25 feet down with some iron pipe I bought at Lowe's.  A recommendation for those that are planning on doing the same, don't buy the 5 foot sections.  Do yourself a favor and buy the 4 foot sections.  I had to stand on the back of my side by side to get enough leverage with the 5 foot extensions (I'm 5'11'').  I won't say it was easy, that would be a lie, but I managed to get 25' in about 6 hours of work.  I hit water after 21 feet and it gets really slow going after that... Great tool!!"
5.0,We have hard clay ground and this auger cut right thru it quickly. I have had to dig several holes with new style clam post hole diggers and they don't work well in this ground. Save time and energy with this Auger.
3.0,Good for sandy soils; not much use in tight soils like clay.  Sturdy piece of equipment.
5.0,Work okay
5.0,Excellent for digging!
5.0,Throw away the old clamshell type digger!! This thing worked wonderfully in my south central Kansas soil.
5.0,"Was not looking forward to digging 10 fence posts in my backyard.  I was able to dig all of them, two feet down in little over an hour.  You still sweat, and it's good workout for the arms, but far better then a shovel, or a clam shell digger."
5.0,I'd never even dug a post hole before . This tool worked for me. I was amazed  with how deep I could go!!
5.0,"I've had this one day and I love it. I've probably got the toughest soil ever seen. we're in the middle of a drought and this thing sounds like wood grinding wood as it bores through my mess with ease. It's taking me about 15 minutes per hole. With clamshell digger, it was taking about 90 minutes per hole. Thank you all who reviewed this and the manufacturer. I've only got 29 more to go!"
5.0,"I had never used an auger before, i'll never use a conentional clamhell post hole digger again."
5.0,"Dug 15 fence post holes, the first one was easy, the 15th got hard, dug holes quickly."
5.0,"I'm used to using a post hole digger, this thing beats those by a mile!!  I bought mine to dig a shallow well to water my grass, just added 5ft 3/4 pipes, works great(unless you hit rocks).  I'm going to use it to put in my fence too on my 6.5 acre property, I'm to cheap to rent a gas powered auger and I probably need the work out anyway."
5.0,I used this to dig about twenty fence post holes. It made quick work of our clay soil. You will need a san angelo bar as this thing does not deal with rocks or roots. But in the absence of those it makes short work of digging a post hole.
5.0,"We have an Organic farm and just finished almost 1 mile of fencing.  This was a major project requiring lots of holes both 3 feet and 2 feet deep by 6 to 14 inches.  We had a neighbor with a tractor mounted PTO auger dig the bigger holes, but on many of the holes it hit hardpan and didn't dig deeper.  For our smaller line posts (4-6 inches) we had another neighbor with a tractor mounted hydraulic post pounder attempt to drive the posts but only got three in the required two feet.  After trying for over two hours, we gave up on the post pounder.
Enter this miraculous devise known as the Seymour Adjustable Auger!!!  We had read online reviews and looked at YouTube videos, and hoped it worked as good as others said.  It was either this, or rent/buy a gas powered auger.  We gambled, and thanks to Prime, two days later we had the auger.
In hard clay with hardpan, we could auger the smaller (6"") line post holes two feet deep, set the post and tamp it in an average of three minutes each!!!  For holes larger than what the auger was capable of (8""), we used the auger to drill down to the desired depth, and used the breaker bar and clamshell digger to widen and clean out the hole.  The auger basket would usually bring up the dirt, but you had to make sure it was somewhat packed.  You quickly acquire a feel for how much is the right amount of packing (by twisting the auger)...too much it is hard to get out, too little it falls back into the hole as you pull the auger out.  Also, others may already know this, but we put a tarp down by each hole we were digging for the dirt, and this made it immensely easier to fill in the dirt afterwards since the shovel wouldn't get caught up in the grass and you could pick up the edges of the tarp and dump dirt into the hole.
We also added an extension of 2 feet 3/4 inch galvanized water pipe for certain holes and it worked well with that.
We would recommend this for anyone anywhere who needs to dig holes.  Give it a try, you will thank yourself later."
5.0,if left in water will rust. made from hardened metal as thee blades do not bend or go blunt even when digging in hard soil. advice is to wet the sil first.
5.0,"These are fantastic tools.  I live near Denver where we have heavy clay in the soil and this auger blasts through easily.

I agree with other reviewers that the handle and connection could be re-engineered.  The wood handle is rough and poorly finished, so wear gloves.  The wood handle is held in place to the steel with the cheapest, worst screw known to man, so I pre-drilled and substituted and decent stainless steel screw.  Still this minor inconvenience isn't enough to delete a star from the rating.

We just planted some new plants and this auger is perfect for digging the holes."
4.0,"I kinda had to tinker with it to adjust and then, it wasn't immediately obvious which way to turn it properly.  50/50 chance right?  I emailed the manufacturer but they never responded.  If you're digging many holes this is easier and a better value than the standard post hole digger.  Most 'box' stores won't even rent this -- they only offer a gas powered auger."
5.0,"Oh
My
Gosh
This is a simply an amazing tool
I augured a three foot deep hole is less than ten minutes and barely broke a sweat. This works far beyond my expectations
I hate the scissors type post hole diggers and am going to take mine out and shoot it!
Buy this , it is great
Really"
5.0,"Terrific axe. I'm using it for light logging, IE: falling and limbing where a chainsaw is overkill. Takes down a 3""-4"" alder with a couple of swings. Perfect swing weight and ballance. Comfortable no-slip grip especially when compared to wood. Takes and holds a great edge. Best axe I've ever owned."
5.0,Very good ax for camping. Can be hazardus because of it's size if you miss what you are aiming at. Very sharp! great for any job!
5.0,I have purchased estwing products before and have always appreciated the old school quality they put into their products. This ax was as good as I had come to expect and will buy another estwing tool when ever I need one. It is a perfect limbing ax after I take down a tree at the cabin.
5.0,Great Quality and a fast delivery are the two major qualities that this axe possessed. I would highly recommend this camping axe to everyone.
3.0,"I loved my Estwing axe and would have given it a 5-star rating until I experienced a catastrophic failure while cutting dry fir after a period of prolonged cold.  The head broke into three evenly sized pieces.  I did not strike a knot in the wood.  I NEVER struck the ground or anything other than wood with this axe.  It had given me years of trouble-free service splitting firewood and even felling trees, (mostly in mild temperatures), and I would have bet my life on it.  It took and held a good edge.  I never had any critical thoughts about it until it broke.  If you won't be using it in very cold situations, it might give you a life time of service.  Maybe I got a lemon.  It cut as well as I could have wished for a couple of years of daily use (our household was heated with wood, and we also heated our hot tub with wood) but then it broke.  If your life will/might depend on your axe, please consider Witterling or Granfors-Bruks.  Yeah, I know.  VERY PRICEY, but cheaper than your life."
5.0,I was given one of these for Christmas.  He told me it was the greatest camp tool ever.  He was right!  I have given one to each of my three sons.  Mine is now 25+ years old and it still in almost new condition.  I take it with me on float trips as we sometimes run into sweepers on the rivers up here in Alaska. I cannot say enough about what a quality tool this is.
5.0,estwing just the name alone means quality I use it alot this summer for all the brush in my back yard
5.0,"The title may sound stupid but at the time, I was not thinking clearly.  If you are looking to split logs with this, you will get a workout for sure! However, if you are chopping a log in half, or clearing a tree, this axe is great.  That is why I still gave it five stars.  Just wanted to provide a warning to axe novices."
5.0,"I own the E45A and its an incredible axe. There is really no need for me to ever buy another of this size. I was surprised when i saw these pictures above that showed ""flaws"" in the steel which indicated ""poor quality"". I know my axe is of the highest quality but it is a few years old. I went down to home depot to see if maybe this is a recent problem with estwing tools. What i found made me laugh. Estwing tools come with a thick clear coat over the axe head to protect it before the tool is purchased. every one of the axes I looked at had little bits of dust or marks or wrinkles in the clear coat exactly like what are shown in the pictures above. If your thinking about getting one of these, the steel is flawless. It's a excellent tool!"
5.0,"Well, I am an axe collector, so I've seen many hundreds if not thousands of axes over the years. For a small camping axe, the E45A is a superior product. I have three of these. One for use, the others I bought to put in my collection. I don't typically buy new axes for my collection, but this axe has earned a spot due to its durability as a field tool, and the fact that it's made in the USA. I am not an Ameri-centic axe collector, but this fact doesn't hurt. The steel is very good and goes through the handle - which is an excellent design. In addition to being virtually unbreakable, the handle's surface texture is both durable and comfortable. It's simply amongst the nicest tools one can currently buy new - that isn't a wallet buster - for light to medium duty chopping. Easy to give this axe the highest recommendation as a light to medium duty chopping tool."
5.0,"So far I've used it as a post hole digger and added 10 additional feet of 3/4"" pipe to use it as a core hole digger to test soil 12 feet down for a dry well.  High quality construction and surprisingly easy to use."
5.0,"For digging post holes, compared to a shovel or a clam shell digger, this auger saves time and energy. I live in a river valley in upstate New York, so while I have a good bit of topsoil, I also have a 4 foot deep frost line. I wanted to put 16 posts in my garden for a more permanent fence and trellis project. This auger chewed through the topsoil like it was fluff. Once I hit the clay, the basket weighed more when I lifted it, but it still bit in at a good rate.

Since I could adjust the head to cut just a little bigger than my posts, the auger turned a two person job into a one man job. Digging the smallest setting, I averaged about a foot every 2 minutes. That includes the time spent breaking up rocks. It takes practice to dig a straight sided wall, and getting the dirt out of the basket almost requires a stick.

With this model being adjustable, I expected it to be a little less sturdy, and maybe fragile. That is most certainly not the case. This tool is built to be used, and to run into rocks. Which is good because I hit a lot of rocks that didn't move till I got out my digging bar.

I dug holes, set posts and tamped the dirt for 16 posts in 2 afternoons with no help. I say it's worth the money because it cut the job in half compared to my shovel, and (spreading the purchase price) it cost me $3.60 per hole."
5.0,"I own 40 acres in Texas.  All the ground is a hard packed clay.  Usually, to set a post, you spend an hour with a post hole digger, or go through the time and trouble of putting the 3-point auger on the tractor.  My husband has arthritis in his spine, so it's always a chore when he needs to work on the fence.  We ordered this based on the reviews.  My husband was extremely dubious of the claims, and expected it would require at least as much work as a clam-shell post hole digger.  Two days after receiving it, he went out to repair a fence post.  I have rarely seen him this happy to be wrong before.  This thing will dig a three foot hole in under five minutes (in HARD ground).  This tool is amazing.  It takes about six turns of the handle to fill it up with dirt, and each time it is filled up you've gained 6 or more inches into the ground.  The hole is perfectly straight and ready for the post in no time.

The tool slices or shaves off the sides as it screws into the ground, and makes short work digging post holes.

The only problems I see with the auger is that the handle is not ""finished"" very well, and ours even had a pretty good sized chip in the handle, but we rectified that with a roll of friction tape.  We also weren't impressed with the supplied screw for the handle, so my husband just used his own screw.

If you are still using the clam-shell diggers, you REALLY need to try this.  Save yourself a LOT of time and effort."
5.0,"Makes nice vertical holes.  I encountered some sand which wouldn't t hold together enough to extract.  I added some water to the hole to make it a little more solid and presto.  Even with the sand detour,I dug a 4'x8"" hole in 20 mins. Works like a charm.  I used this to create a dog poo composting hole."
4.0,"recieved ahead of schedule is sturdy and well built, only gave it four stars because I haven't used it yet will update review after 1st use"
1.0,I purchased this to drill 18 holes for a deck using 8 inch tubes.  So I go to lowes and pick up the tubes. Which I selected the tubes that are  basically 7.5 inside so they would be 8 inches on the outer diameter.  ( the tubes are 8'' nominal so if you pick the smaller ones they are 7.5 inside and the large ones are about 8.25)  So I drill a hole with the auger and I guess I should have measured it before but this thing drills appr 7 1/4 inch holes.  Not the 4-6-or 8 inch holes it is described as capable of..  It is adjusted all the way out. Almost ready to modify the thing and bore out the holes wider on the adjustment.  But this irritated me as I thought I was buying an 8 inch hole digger.....
5.0,This auger is light and easily to used. No pounding with the pole digger . I can get the hole in half the time. I recommend this  to anyone who would like to save their hands!
5.0,About twenty minutes to go four feet in the same soil that had taken an hour to go two feet using a scissors style post hole digger. I think if you hit a large rock you would be done but the same could be said for the other style post hole digger. These aren't available locally so Amazon Prime came through for me here with free shipping.
5.0,"We purchased this product to dig footings for a small cabin.  A regular post hole digger would have made the job more difficult.  We still needed a spade to cut through tree roots, but other than that we are please with this product."
5.0,"Much easier than the clamshell diggers. Well made, easy to adjust. Would recommend to anyone looking to dig some holes."
5.0,"Axe made in USA. Small leather sheath that covers the head made in Haiti (hey, they need the help, remember the earthquake)

Anyway this axe is made out of tool steel, so it is high grade. The head and shaft are forged in a single piece so you will never, ever, have to replace the handle. The steel comes covered in an epoxy enamel to keep the majority of it from rusting. This axe is long enough to get some good leverage (and I am 6'2""), but light enough that my wife said she could use it if I taught her how, and she is a very dainty girl at that.

The blade comes factory sharpened, not razor sharp, but any sharper and it would dull too fast from chopping wood so the factory sharpness is perfect I'd say. If you're buying an axe for serious long term use it goes without saying regardless of the brand you will need a sharpener of some kind."
5.0,"I own 4 Estwing hammers and 3 other Estwing products. So, for me, it was a no-brainer to order this axe. I was looking for something in between a hatchet and a full-size axe. When I got this axe, it was immediately obvious that it had the typical exceptional quality and balance as I always expect from Estwing. I used a 10 inch file to quickly touch-up the blade to the sharpness that I want a utility blade to have. It is exactly what I was looking for. Anyone purchasing this item should be completely satisfied."
5.0,"i started looking into the estwing brand after owning one of their hammers (the best hammer you could buy for construction and heavy carpentry) and i had to have this axe, first impression, JUST AS GOOD AS MY 10 YEARS OLD HAMMER!!! ,i cant understand the guy complaining about antiquated manufacturing procedures, if he complaints about this axe , he would throwing fire from his mouth if he had purchased any of the chinese made ones, no point of comparison, and this guys can stamp the American flag with pride on their products, as you WILL NOT find anything remotely comparable on the same price range, of course you could go with a better axes than this one, you just have to spend 100 dollars or more for it.
This axe is a little heavy for its intended purpose (camping) but if you don't mind carrying it arround, it will thank you for doing it as it is as good as it gets for a camping axe, and very good compared with other top tier ones,buy it

Little thing to consider: if you don't want to carry this 4 pound axe around in your camping, hiking trip, i would recommend getting a sven saw, serves the same purpose just as well, and is a dream to carry lol."
5.0,"I bought this to maintain the single track motorcycle and mtn bike trails I ride (its private and I am the only one keeping it up). It works really well on 4 and 5 inch trees.  The larger, old downed oaks are another story, they are like flint and nothing would cut them.  Some people have noted casting flaws in the metal, but that is silly, its an axe and not Wusthof kitchen knives.  Its a little smaller than a full size axe, and a bit larger than a hatchet.  Nice size for me to carry on my bike but still gives me enough leverage to get a good swing with both hands.  Dont buy it to cut firewood for your home, but to keep in the camper, under the truck seat, or to clean up around the house, its great."
5.0,"If you live in the woods, or use firewood, this axe is a very worthwhile investment. Quality of construction is unsurpassed, comes nice and sharp with a well built leather sheath that has two sturdy clips. Chops down trees, limbs, can make kindling, and in a pinch will split fire wood. You will still need a maul for some logs, but you need one anyway. Never buy an axe handle again! They cost almost ten bucks and take time to install, so save yourself money and effort and invest in a tool that doesn't need a lifetime guarantee. This thing is indestructible! Pass it on to your children. Another amazing quality estwing product. Support this company."
5.0,"I use this axe to split smaller rounds (under 8"" or so), make kindling, and chop roots around tree stumps to dig them up. It's wonderfully ergonomic and has a comfortable handle. It's so well-designed it literally feels like an extension of your arm. It's also well-made, like all Estwing tools. I fully expect it to last a lifetime."
5.0,Excellant tool. Good size for most wood cutting jobs. Very Durable. Well balanced and tuned.
5.0,My brother in law has always like Estwing hammers and i saw an article in the magazine talking about how rugged the Ax was.  I thought I would give it a shot.  It worked beautifully for what i needed an ax big enough to cut down trees up to 12 inches in diameter but small and light enough to easily take camping or anywhere.  Its a great product and American made (minus the sheath).
5.0,"I bought this item and have only used it once.

This tool is solid, Estwing quality.

I am looking forward to sharpening this more this spring and using it often over the summer."
5.0,"You can't go wrong with this axe. It is virtually indestructible and holds a great edge. The weight and balance are awesome. It is the perfect length for a camping axe because it fits in my plastic camping container (for car camping) but has almost the same chopping power as a regular length wooden-handled axe, probably because it has about the same weight due to the metal shaft. I like the fact that it comes with a protective leather sheath. Great product!"
4.0,"Bought this to help me build my first ever fence and I wasn't disappointed. This auger made the post-hole digging process very easy!

Pro's:
- The adjustable size was very convenient.
- Much easier on your back than a clam-shell auger - very low impact.
- Left very clean holes.

Cons:
- My posts were 4x4's, the tamping end of my digging bar was about 2-inches in diameter and I was setting the posts directly into the soil - no cement. I had stones and roots in my soil which tended to guide the auger slightly of position. After the holes were dug using the largest diameter of 8-inches, if I needed to adjust the position of the 4x4 post just slightly off-center inside the hole there wasn't always enough room on all sides of the post to tamp down the earth; I had to use the digging end of the digging bar to widen the hole in these cases to create the additional room to tamp down the soil. A larger diameter would have helped avoid this problem (as would the absence of stones and roots from my soil)
- The soil in my garden was very loose and dry. When removing the soil from the hole, the auger itself could not scoop out much of the soil and I had to get in there to scoop with my hands and a small trowel.

The cons didn't really hinder my progress all that much but they were there. Overall, I was very happy with this purchase.

The digging and tamping bar that I used was the following:

5.0,I fenced my entire backyard using this auger.  The 15 post holes were dug to a depth of 24 to 32 inches in less than 10 minutes each.  Anyone with moderate strength should be able to handle this excellent tool.
5.0,"Have not used yet, but matched my expectation. Purchased to dig a lot of uniform (not hugely oversized) post holes. The problem w/ scissor handle diggers are that to go reasonably deep enough to insure a strong post, not subject to frost heave over a cold winter, you have to enlarge the top of the hole and removing more dirt than is required with this type. Unit appears well built by an American Company and is adjustable in 1"" increments from 6-8"" so will allow adjustment for larger posts, but only to the point of what's needed."
5.0,"I haven't used this product and probably should before giving it a 5 star, however, the quality appears to be good.  I will go back and rate this differently if it fails my expectations."
5.0,"I bought this in preparation for building a fence for my yard. This auger digs very clean holes quickly. We have a somewhat sandy soil that quickly turns to clay after a few inches. Digging down to 24 inches was no problem in most spots. I did not test the adjustable functionality of the auger.

I have a distaste for the clamshell post-hole diggers that drove my purchasing decision. I did find, however, that the clamshell digger would come in handy in spots where this auger was unable to dig. This auger had difficulty in spots with tree roots (even smaller ones), which is to be expected as that is not the designed intent of the auger. The post hole digger is more capable of chopping up small roots. Also, the handle of the auger would get in the way for digging post holes near structures such as the house, which is where the lower profile clamshell excelled.

Don't let that stop you from purchasing this, for the holes that I dug that I did not encounter roots, it was quick (5 minutes) and painless. If you have a yard relatively clear of tree roots, this is the way to go. If not, get this anyway and have the clamshell supplement it. Now that I've built the fence, I'm on the lookout for projects that would require this auger - a shallow well perhaps?"
5.0,"My husband and I are putting up a rather large fence around our house.  We have a regular clam shell post hole digger, but knew there was no way we could us it alone to put in 50 posts.  I read the reviews and decided to order this product.  It arrived yesterday and my husband had to use it right away to see how it worked.  He was very pleased.  There will still be a lot of hard work and sweat, but this will make the job a little easier."
5.0,"I have hard clay soil and digs through with plenty of muscle, but holds up. My shovels bend digging through my soil even when soaked with water."
5.0,I needed an Auger to dig holes for footings. I was building a deck and this was just the ticket. Easy to use and very quick in comparison to a regular post hole digger.
5.0,I didn't imagine digging a post hole would be so easy.  I was working on a project and was able to dig 3 holes in the time it took someone else with a different post hole digger to dig one.  Definitely a good buy.  Haven't used it a ton but it seems like it will be sturdy enough to last.
5.0,"Excellent quality, with unique adjustment capability. Works fine, except when soil is very dry/hard. It still takes a fair amount of muscle power to use it, no matter how well made.  Works MUCH better than the 2-handle squeeze type hole digger."
4.0,"Here in New England, we are 'blessed' with glacial till for top soil. Lots of stones, rocks, and of course roots. I bought one of those 6' digging bars to help remove that stuff. This auger-style digger works great. It smoothly digs into the ground, when I hit rocks or roots, the bar gets them out of the way, and we move on with the auger. Much better than the scissor-style."
5.0,"Best Hole digger ever.  I saw this on Amazon and everyone had great things to say about it.
I decided to purchase one and I am proud I did.  It does an excellent job.  I use it to get the hole dug to depth then shape the hole with the clam shell style diggers."
5.0,"Love the auger style posthole diggers - - if one can truly love any digging inplement.  We live in an area with clay soil and other styles of diggers jar the arms and upper body.  I used this auger to dig 36' deep holes.  I do not believe, however, an auger style would work with high sand soil."
5.0,Works Great as long there are no big stones or roots in the way. Can do a 3 ft deep hole in a little over 10 minutes
5.0,"When I started looking around for a solution I was not familiar with these.  What peaked my interest was the consumer who dug a 22 ft well with it by replacing the handle with standard 3/4 inch pipe.  I had a different problem. I needed something that would cut a nice hole 18-24 inches deep under the house in limited space.

I just used it today for the first time, replacing the handle with my modified version of a 16 inch 3/4 pipe and a handle assembly made of 1 inch pipe.  In the past digging such a small hole with a shovel would have wore me out.  with this I was down to about 12 inches within 15 minutes (had to remove a couple of tree roots) and then finished the hole in about another 15 minutes.  It still takes some effort, but it did not wear me out like the shovel did.  Each time I pulled it out the auger was full of dirt, unlike my experiences with a post hole digger. I have several fence posts to replace this year and next spring, I hoping it pays off as well then with the standard handle that comes with it."
1.0,"There's a big design flaw in this auger. The piece that you insert the handle into is welded onto the shaft - it is not all one piece. So, there's a high potential for a weak point. On the one I bought, the weld failed literally within fifteen minutes of starting to use this."
5.0,"Finally a well made, heavy duty auger. Used and was amazed that it jut screwed itself into the hole by just turning the handle. Dug 8 holes in a short time. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a hand auger built to last."
5.0,"Very well build product, easy to adjust size of hole, also comes with a wooden handle.  I used this to drill a hole for a shallow well.  I hit water at 13 feet, if you are drilling deeper than about 4 feet you will need to buy some 1"" pipe. I bought two 5 foot lengths and added them when needed.  My soil was sand, so drilling was quite easy.  It took about 2 hours to drill 13ft.  Would recommend this product."
5.0,"very easy to dig post holes and worth every penny to me, rocks and roots are an issue but that is true with other post hole diggers as well."
5.0,The Seamour auger is constructed of substantial metal and so solid construction. It appears to be very durable and should last a lifetime.
5.0,"This is the ideal sprinkler for flower gardens,  you can adjust the distance by adjusting the height, the higher the larger the radius along with the adjustment of the water pressure also it runs well under low water pressure.  You can control the water usage by using smaller  diameter hose with out losing any of the water pressure."
4.0,I noted several people had problems with this little lite weight sprinkler but I have used mine often and liked it so much I ordered two more. I like that it covers a LOT of area with not having to turn the faucet on much. Lite weight and you can change the height. I did buy another one very similar but heavier and more expensive. It works well too but this is much cheaper.
1.0,This sprinkler is a great design - but very poorly made.  All plastic and thin aluminum.  The plastic attachment for connecting on the hose broke after 4 uses.  Spend a little more and get a good quality one.
1.0,"cheap and poorly made.......I purchased this item, looked like poor quality for the price when it arrived but tried it anyway......bad choice and now it is beyond use.  should have sent it back when I realized the poor quality."
2.0,"When I opened the box I thought Amazon sent the wrong sprinkler. I ordered this sprinkler specifically because it claims to have a square pattern. The ones in the box had rotating heads which ALWAYS provides a circular pattern (physics). I double checked the model number, the order and even the Amazon webpage. All of them agreed this was the square pattern sprinkler I ordered. I thought maybe someone had figured out how to overcome a natural law (centrifugal force) so I set it up. Even though I used the step on the stake to set it in the ground, just holding the tubing while I stuck it in the ground was enough to slightly bend it. I turned the water on and watched. Just as I thought it made a circular pattern that wasn't near to 50' feet in diameter, though that is probably due to low water pressure (65-85 psi) from being on a well. It also leaked from the top down the tubing and wobbled as it rotated. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I bought two of these sprinklers for a 50' x 75' garden thinking that even with the well pressure being lower than city water pressure, they should cover the garden nicely. The sprinkler actually covered less than a third of the garden and being circular in pattern, it left the corners uncovered. I do better with one properly set up oscillating sprinkler and two small fixed sprinklers for the unreached corners. For height, I would recommend using a T-Post and wiring the oscillating sprinkler to the top of it. Not only is it sturdier, it has more height to clear tall vegetables (like corn and pole beans), reaches further and is cheaper.
My advice is don't buy one, although if you have a small garden, or a circular garden, or are on city water, you will most likely have better performance. If you do buy one, DON'T push on the top to set the stake, and extend it after you have set it in the ground...you will be less likely to bend the very thin aluminum tubing that way."
1.0,"We purchased this sprinkler and were very happy with its performance-easy to operate and change the height.  However, after just a few weeks, the base of the aluminum tube began to bend and finally cracked in half, rendering the sprinkler useless.  The tube should have been made of much sturdier aluminum, or even of plastic pipe."
4.0,"Having seen similar items locally (but at a much higher price), I couldn't resist the price Amazon offered, and sure enough a couple days later a rather large box was on my doorstep.  When I opened it up, I saw what appeared to be a bit smaller and lighter weight than I imagined (though consistent with the facts provided), but I quickly expanded the telescoping shaft and staked it into the ground.  Many other sprinklers fail to deliver the promised range, so I was surprised to find it exceed the stated coverage area (quickly fixed by dialing down the spigot).

All things considered, I'm very happy with this sprinkler, and I'm sure it will get the job done in the garden this summer.  I docked it a star for being rather lightly built (no issues thus far)."
2.0,"This sprayer has a very drippy nozzle.  Forget using this to spray pesticide inside your house.  Each time you stop spraying, it leaves a small puddle on the floor.  I decided to go for the absolute best sprayer for pesticide.  The B&G Sprayer.  It's the Rolls Royce of sprayers.  No drip and extremely fine and precise nozzle spray."
5.0,Used this sprayer to put down sealer on my stained concrete. Lifetime warranty and a high quality sprayer. Buy this and you won't need another one.
5.0,very well built and has steel parts no plastic. For the cost I would recommend this over any store bought pump I have seen.
5.0,This sprayer is solid and works very well.  I was getting tired of replacing a plastic sprayer every two years.  I expect to use this for a long time.
4.0,"I bought this so I can spray an aqueous based copper fungicide and sometimes in combination with a natural soap based pesticide for my gardens, this mixture does not dissolve well and tend to form precipitants.  So my original spray bottle clogs up completely when using this combination and my forearms get a really good workout.  So I searched and decide to give the 3 gal a try since it was only $5 more than the 2 gal.  I had bypassed the cheaper plastic ones because I can be rough on my equipment.

I have used this unit many times in the past months and so far it works well.  I found the plastic spray attachment pretty useless for my purposes, and it clogs easily. The original brass attachment does the job ranging from a fine mist to a jet (max distance probably 30-40' at a 45degree angle).  The trigger handle allows for good control of how the pressure is released, this made it easy to stand at one point and spray the jet close or far without destroying the young plants due to excessive pressure.

I would ask for four design changes:
1.  a pressure gauge to know when optimal pressure is achieved.
2.  a manual pressure release to depressurize the unit.
3.  put the spray wand clip on the opposite end of the carrying strap attachment.  These two things get in the way of each other.
4.  put an external solid carry handle so it can be moved easily.

Aside from these 4 flaws, I am happy with the purchase (thus far) it has made my life easier.  No comments on the effectiveness of the tri-poxy coating since I have only used water based solutions, the tri-poxy coating is probably suffice.  It seems very sturdy but I have not purposely tried to test this observation."
3.0,"Chapin used to make these units almost entirely out of metal. I purchased in March of 2001 a Chapin Industrial 3.5-Gallon Open Head General Duty Sprayer #1941 which all the major parts are made out of metal, I use it on the weekends around the house, it still going strong (August 2009).

unfortunately Chapin Premire Pro 2-Gallon Tri-poxy Steel Sprayer #1280 all of it internal parts are made out of plastic and it fails within 14 months of its purchase, I called the company they replaced apart no questions asked. I told her my disappointment in the company's choice of materials she acknowledged it and said it was ashamed that the company is doing that.

If I had known I would not have purchased it."
5.0,"I have this steel (non stainless steel) model which lasted only 3 years before rusting an leaking at the seam under pressure.  The pressure was quite good. That was the bad news, the good news, company replaced the whole unit without charge after 3 years because the tank leaked.  The pressure is quite good.  I use it for small trees, bushes and it works great.

The proper way to bleed out the pressure is to turn the unit upside down and release the pressure throught the wane before refilling. There will be some Liq. in the wane, so be careful."
5.0,"Professional quality.  Ease to change nozzles a plus.  Does an excellent job getting fungicide on the underside of rose leaves. Quickly switch nozzles and stream spray climbing roses. Fairly lightweight for metal sprayer. Over all, the Chapin 1380 is a great tool for rosarians."
5.0,"This thing works. I used to build field fence for a profession for the government. Oh how I wish I had one of these instead of a standard post-hole digger. I still had to use a spud bar when going through rock and root, but it just ate through the clay."
4.0,"The post auger works as advertised.  Extended handle another 30"" with 3/4"" black pipe and union.  We'll see how it holds up."
5.0,"If you've ever used the type of post hole digger with the two long handles and the two shovel heads at the ends on hinges you know what a chore that can be.  I will NEVER - and that's a long time and a bold statement - NEVER use one of the two handled shovel type post hole diggers again.  This is the easiest post hole digger you will ever use and you can bore down through the dirt and make a perfectly round post hole in no time at all.  I've had one that I got from my grandfather about 20 years ago that was an antique when I got it and bought this one for a family friend of mine that was constantly borrowing MY post hole digger of the same design.  You will NOT be sorry you bought this if you need a post hole digger.  VERY good construction, heavy duty, not an overly heavy tool though, and will save your arms, your back and all of the agony of digging a post hole with the two handled shovel type post hole diggers that seem to be for sale everywhere.  Save your money and don't buy a gas powered post hole digger, you don't need it.  This one is flat out hands down one of the best tools I own for working in the yard."
5.0,"I bought this after searching for alternatives to the typical ""pinching"" post digger.  I live in a very heavy clay soil area, that can be quite tough to deal with.  This thing makes easy work of the clay down to 1 meter (as far as I dug).  It worked wonderful and made setting posts so easy.

The hole that was dug was so straight and uniform, that I was shocked.  Each hole took about 15 minutes to dig (averaged over the course of setting 10 posts - got a bit slower as I lost energy).  Doing it again, I would have added a pipe extension because once down in the ground, getting traction to turn the auger became wearing.

As other reviewers have stated, roots can be a problem.  A spud bar made quick work of those and I could get back to digging in under a minute at most time.

I did change the bolt out on the adjustment for width to a bolt that has nylon in it.  Occasionally it would work lose and this was my solution.  Considering the force applied, I was really impressed by the way the adjustment worked and how well it stayed adjusted.

The auger has a tendency to walk a bit, so your hole might move from where you have identified you post location.

Drive a stake in the ground to bang the auger on to release the dirt.  This will probably only really apply to heavy clays or moist soil, but this saved some work of cleaning each load of dirt out."
5.0,Digging post holes is much easier using this auger.  Less stress on your arms and back than regular post hole diggers.
5.0,"Arrived on time and in brand-new condition. Bought this to bore a surficial well. As long as you don't hit a water table, this implement will allow you to dig as far as you are physically capable."
5.0,"Easy to use, even for this middle-aged woman.  Digs right through the dirt.  When you hit rocks, you have to pull it out and dump the dirt a little more often.  When planting flowers that I want in just the right spot, not a few inches here or there, I dig a tiny starter hole and I get a hole exactly where I want it.  Got the post holes dug in minutes.  The dry dirt was trickier because it kept caving into the hole. Probably should have just watered the area first."
3.0,"I got this tool hoping it would keep me from procrastinating the annual planting of my bulbs.  It did make a nice hole and I did finally get my bulbs in, but in my soil, if I'm honest, I think a spade would have been less work. I have a lot of rocks and tree roots and very hard soil.  The rocks are particularly problematic for this auger."
4.0,"I was looking for an auger like this for a long time and none of the hardware stores in my area carried it.  The clamshell style post-hole diggers are difficult to use and not as efficient as this auger.  I used it on soils with sand and some rocks.  The rocks depending on size with interfere with the auger.  The auger does not perform as efficently with ground water, depending on the soil types.  Otherwise this device is easy to use and takes about 15 minutes to make a hole."
5.0,"when you use this for the first time, you are going to be amazed at how well it works. I was. I can actually go deeper that 2 feet in hard clay soil with it with ease. The only jams i got was when i hit a rock. It even a small 2 inch rock can jam it. Also, it is not easy to stay at the point where you started with it, so to solve that, i do a starter small whole."
2.0,I ordered this sprayer for my husband. Thought I was getting a good one. When he opened the box the sprayer had a huge dent in the side. Not sure if this will adversely affect the functionality of the product but was really disappointed because he had wanted to purchase one somewhere else and I convinced him that  I could order one.  Live and learn!
5.0,"Best I have used.  Holding up well, Happy with purchase. Should last me a very long time."
3.0,Not what expected for a Chapin sprayer..it leaks in a part of the wand....does not old pressure....am I doing something wrong???
4.0,Very good
5.0,Great quality!
4.0,"I have used it 4 times to round up my 2 acre yard
It works just great, no problems. Love it, cut the time of this chore from 3hrs. To 1hr."
5.0,Used this sprayer for diesel fuel and it never clogged up and sprayed perfect all the time
5.0,Great product. Exceeded expectations!!!
1.0,"pump sprayer broker, please replace."
5.0,"American product.  Strong, resilient, tough, and dependable.  Great spray pattern too!  Using a wettable powder will get light clogging on this tip but it's not a problem at all because you still have plenty of flow and a light tap and you're back in business.  Never once did I have to disassemble the tip to continue like other sprayers.  Worth the investment.  I've sprayed at least three million bugs to their deaths with this awesome bottle!"
5.0,Good quality
5.0,You won't find a better sprayer that will last you a lifetime. Don't waste your time with the cheap plastic ones unless you like wasting money.
5.0,"Good quality.  Works as expected. Must give it a good cleaning after use, then it looks like new again."
5.0,"Used this to apply sealant to my driveay and it workd really well in terms of pressure and ease of use.  If you plan on sealing a surface, make sure you get a fan nozzle to go along with this. This comes with a cone nozzle and it made the job a little more difficult and did not allow me to spread the sealant evenly."
5.0,Great product
5.0,Works Great and looks great too!!! Love it!
5.0,This is a fantastic product
4.0,This is a great item so far. I just used it and it made my job much easier and quicker. The only issues I have is it was dented the day I opened the box and didn't want to wait another week for returns. I've bought several other sprayers this one is solid!
4.0,d
3.0,Worked great for awhile but then brass wand sprang leaks!
3.0,"Failed after 1 year of light use.  The epoxy coating on the canister cracked, chipped, and lifted off the metal allowing it to rust inside the neck where the hand pump seal washer seats. This allows air under pressure to leak out so you pretty much have to pump it continuously for it to work.  Phoned Chapin about the trouble and they offered to replace it."
5.0,great sprayer
5.0,excellent product
1.0,Craped out after a year the tank is strong but the plastics pump is very dangerous I put a gallon of demon pesticide in it and started to pump it up to gain pressure all the poison came fusing out of the top the spray tip is not to be used for pesticides or indoor use only for outdoor use it leaks it has a metal Handel and wand but no fine mist this was a bad mistake.
3.0,"The handle is leaking, it's really not for domestic pesticides."
2.0,rusted out after one year
1.0,"After tossing out many Chapin plastic sprayers over my lifetime,
I would be wary of spending money on this 'steel' sprayer!
I'm not convinced they are capable of producing anything of any merit. Sorry to say."
5.0,Great buy
5.0,Great sprayer.  Don't waste your money on some plastic piece of crap.  Buy a metal Chapin and you will love it.
5.0,"Best canister I ever bought.  Not flimsy like the plastic ones.  I own 3 for Round Up, Deer Spray & Garden Spray.  Pump it up & the sprayer works a good long while before the pumping is needed again.  I went through any cheap plastic ones & these are far superior & made with quality parts.  One canister came with the metal sprayer bent. I called the manufacturer & they sent me a new one next day at no cost."
5.0,I use this sprayer every day now for the last six months and it has never let me down
4.0,"It seems very well made, but the wand is too short. I use vinegar to spray weeds in walkways and on patios. I have to stay bent over while I am spraying. I'll give another review after a few months of use."
5.0,"I have only used it once so far but so far so good. This is the 4th sprayer I have bought in 5 years, tired of the imports that cost half a much and last a year.
It is a bit heavy and the hose isn't very long, a strap to carry it would be nice, but if it holds up like I expect I can deal with all of these things."
1.0,"Spray nozzle leaks anytime the tank is underpressure. Causes a mess anytime you use it, and you can also get the chemicals on unintended things."
5.0,good
5.0,"Ordered March 2012.  Still working great.  Will outlast and outperform  the cheapie plastics sprayers.  Gets five stars even though a few things can be better in my opinion.  Yes, we know what opinions are like, everyone has one.  I use the sprayer to kill weeds over a large area.  The nozzle adjusts from a solid stream  to a  round shape spray.  There is no way to adjust the volume of liquid being discharged. Maybe there are replacement nozzles to lessen the volume of liquid discharged from the sprayer.  I have not looked for one.

TIPS
====
1.  Before and after each use extend the pump shaft and lubricate with WD-40 or sewing machine oil, etc.  Work the shaft a few times.  This will extend the life if the pump over time.

2.  If you need to spray close to the ground for extended periods with the tank full get a wand extension.  The wand supplied with the sprayer is about 11 or 12 inches long.  I am under 6 feet tall and have to bend slightly to get close to the ground.  Note:  make sure the wand fits your sprayer.  Some require a male end, others a female end."
2.0,The pump shaft is made of carbon steel!  All I use it for is rinsing with water and it rusts!  It would be perfect with a stainless steel shaft but I guess they had to keep the cost down?  Dumb move!
5.0,Not a better sprayer out there in my opinion. If you clean it after every use it lasts for years!
1.0,"What a waste, Assumed for paying 60+ I would get something that would actually work, Right from the start it does the same thing the 20.00 cheapos do, Pull trigger to spray and release and a constant flow of fluid keeps running out, Why have a fine spray head to just follow it up with draining out after the trigger is released. What a POS"
5.0,I love these sprayers. So much better than the plastic junk.
5.0,Great item !!!!
4.0,"Very nice, but I would have liked a handle and pump to be constructed of metal."
5.0,Works fine.
5.0,"BEST ONE YET. I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL PLASTIC MODELS AND THEY WILL NOT TOLERATE THE SUN OUT HERE IN THE DESERT. I LIVE IN MESQUITE, NV AND NOTHING CONSTRUCTED OUT OF PLASTIC LASTS LONG. I USED IT ALL SUMMER AND NO COMPLAINTS. GREAT SPRAYER."
4.0,Have used this sprayer a lot this year.  The sprayer and wand are top quality.  The single point attachment for the shoulder strap is a bit awkward but the sprayer itself is very nice.  I have been able to spray up into the tops of apple trees 20 feet off the ground.
5.0,Arrived on time and works perfect.
5.0,Nice sprayer
1.0,From the start the spray nozzle wouldn't work properly. Difficult to adjust to spray at even medium pressure without dripping. Used about 6 times before the center plunger mechanism failed. Now it won't pressurize at all. Tank looks good but thats about it.
4.0,This is good product but with 2gal full it can get heavy (Very heavy) so if you cant handle the weight buy a carrying case aswell with it. The product it self is very nice!
5.0,This is what sold us on the product. MADE IN USA. Great quality and worth the price. Will purchase more of your products in the future.
5.0,"This is a great sprayer, I have had several types of sprayers and none can compare to this one. It has an adjustable nozzle and it sprays up to 8ft with ease and can also adjust nozzle for a a very close up spray"
5.0,"Well I used this sprayer for the first time today and was flawless.  I mixed up two tanks with Barrier weed and plant killer and went to town.  For a 3 gallon sprayer, I only had to pump tank 2 times(10 pumps) on all 3 gallons.  Very well built with all brass wand.  Will save me alot of money not having to weed-eat the  brush in  woods and grass at  fence line."
5.0,Used to spray diesel in asphalt hauling dump beds. Doesn't leak at the handle like plastic wand sprayers do. Spray stream will reach the front of the bed.
5.0,This is built like a tank! Instead of buying a new sprayer every year or two invest in a chapin and no more worries.
5.0,"This sprayer is like the professional one's that the pest control people use. If you have had bad experiences with the old cheep sprayers not working properly, use this one and you want be looking for the next sprayer."
5.0,OH so much better then the twenty dollar sprayer you get at your local DYI store.  It's great product since it's mostly metal parts don't break like plastic.
3.0,"I have been in the lawn and garden industry for 30+ years.  The nozzle on this sprayer has not changed and I'm mot sure why if the smallest bit of debris gets into the tank it totally screws up the nozzle and effects the spray pattern and you have to spend more time cleaning the nozzle than spraying whatever you are spraying.  And it seems like there is no in between a fine mist and a direct spray.  I have a Red Max sprayer that seems to never clog and always has the same uninterrupted spray could be the filter at the fill cap.  That might be the solution I will give that a try and leave more feedback if it solves the problem.  The rest of the sprayer seems to be made relatively well, but this is kind of a pain the rear."
1.0,"I was very happy with this sturdy sprayer  .. until it started to lose pressure from the plunger/handle. No matter how hard I (or my husband) tighten it down, there is a small hissing sound and the pressure drops rapidly. I made sure that the treads hadn't been stripped and then signed on to Amazon to request a return/refund .. but of course the time window for that had closed.  I bought a very expensive piece of bright blue steel ... buyer beware."
3.0,"The unit that I received had a leaky nozzle so I ended up returning it....not a good thing when you have Roundup in the tank.

Overall, the unit was nice but there were a few things that I would look for in a new one.  The strap that came with it could have been longer and more comfortable. While it did fit over my shoulder a larger stap would have made the process a lot easier.  Also, keep in mind that the tank itself is 7 lbs so its a bit heavy to begin with and a comfortable strap is a must.  There is also no ""Pressure Release Valve"" on the tank so one needs to unscrew the filler cap to release the pressure.  When you do this, a rush of air and whatever you have in the container comes out and ends up spraying in your face and all over you. I would assume that the key to preventing this is to not end up with a lot of pressure in the tank when you are finished spraying, but thats easier said than done most of the time.  I also felt that the hose assembly could have been a bit longer as well.  It is 5' long but an extra foot would have been ideal for my 6' height. The four position nozzle is a separate plastic nozzle that you attach to the brass tube, so you get two separate nozzle choices to choose from. The ""main"" spray nozzle (which is brass) and the four position plastic one.  In conclusion, for the price that I paid for this unit, I would have expected more.  One could find all these features in a plastic sprayer for about $20 less."
5.0,"I had plastic kind of sprayer before but need to pump every 2-3min and it was so much hassle.  I saw this sprayer on Amazon with good review, I gave it a try.  I used it today first time to spray my citrus trees.  For steel construction, it is light.  It comes with strap so you can carry it around on your shoulder, that is plus.
Instruction does not say how much you can pump but till you get resistance.  I had no problem pumping about 30, which gives you at least 5-10min of continuous spraying.  The wand is all metal construction also.

I can see this sprayer will last a long time.  I highly recommended"
5.0,Great price fast shipping
4.0,"We purchased the aluminum snath and this blade last summer when we became owners of an overgrown New England property.  Fields of goldenrod and friends about four feet high then.  We resolved to have little or no gas-powered devices so we tried the scythe -- took the plunge on the Seymour without getting embroiled in the Austrian versus American tangle.  It was a lot of work but we did clear some paths and we were thus protected from lurking ticks and poison ivy for the rest of the season.  This spring, the grassy weeds of the main acre average 2 feet high just now and the Craigslist mower gave up the ghost in 4 hours.  Chastised for having trusted a gas-guzzler might ease my burdens, I pulled out the scythe, sharpening it with a moderate stone 5 times on each side of the blade about every ten minutes of work (generally when I take a swig of water in hot weather). The blade works very well on the brush -- multiflora roses, poison ivy, goldenrod, milkweed and such.  It does get bogged down when there is heavy grass mixed in -- the grass seems to drain my momentum in the tangle and the grass tends to fall flat without actually get cut.  BUT, when I get a patch of primarily think stemmed weeds it is a glorious path of trimming exercise with quick results.  I am still a newbie but have a rhythm that works for durations of a few hours at a time, but when I have a good groove this is a nice tool to wield.  This blade is not shy and easily clips anything vertical that is stiff enough to put up some resistance.  We am quite pleased with this blade and will soon invest in the grass blade too."
4.0,"The scythe blade and aluminum handle work well together, it is light wieght and works very well for keeping the grass and brush up to 1 inch down along the edges of the roads and fields. It works better than a weed wacker, which gets tangled up with the tall grass and only trims the very small brush."
5.0,"Came sharp, just wished it was sharper out of the box, but I guess I must learn to peen/wet sharpen my Blade!  Seems to cut good, but now I need a good scythe stone!

I am new at the Scythe scene!"
5.0,"I have been scything about 7-10 acres of hay every year. By September, the goldenrod comes in and other woody species just seem to appear. Certain areas remain uncut because it is too much for my scythe. I've used a European style scythe up until now. I purchased this American style scythe and a snath just to try it out. American scythes to my knowledge have only received scathing reviews and I wanted to see for myself why that is. So far, I can say the American version cuts fine and just chuckles at woody growth that the European blade would complain vigorously about. It takes a different technique in scything and sharpening it is different as well. But both techniques are quickly learned. It is a hardy tool, robust and heavy. It feels as if it will stand up to years of abuse and certainly does not possess the  delicacy of its European counterpart. In straight grass meadows, I can probably cut faster with the European scythe, with less effort, and in a more meditative state of mind, but in mixed meadows, where woody stems are more than occasional, the American scythe shines. Here it out maneuvers, out mows, and survives where the other would run and hide or get dinged up so bad mowing would be over for the day (or longer).  It's bad reputation , as I can tell so far, is undeserved. I'll know more and have a better comparison come October when haying season is over for me. The other issue is I have not been able to find an adjustable snath for the European scythe whereas it is the most common type of snath for the American style scythe. Don't misunderstand me, I love my European style scythe and it will do the bulk of my haying for me. But when the going gets a bit rough, I'll be turning to the American scythe to get the job done."
5.0,"OK, so it takes a little manual labor, but for the quietness of this tool, it makes it all worth while. I don't suppose many folks use the scythe anymore, but if you have a pretty large area of overgrowth and you want to take it down quickly and quietly, this is the tool. Each swing takes out a huge area at a time and in terms of speed, it beats a weedeater, hands down! Once you get a rhythym going, it's actually kind of nice to use. Get a shot of exercise and accomplish something while doing it. The blade and handle will run you around $100.00, but it is worth every penny. I will last at least one lifetime, maybe more."
5.0,"Works fine to fill water balloons, which is what I wanted it for.  Quality is good and it's inexpensive so five stars.  Most people want this for its ""jet"" and it's fine for that too.  For filling water balloons though, I prefer the Nelson Brass Sweeper Nozzle 50161 on the end of a Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red.  The lip on the Nelson nozzle helps hold the balloon and the spring loaded handle on the nozzle makes it easier to control the water flow.  The second system is a tad more convenient, but at more than twice the cost."
3.0,"The plus: The smooth operating lever creates a linear increase in water flow and a complete shut off. It's also reliable: I had left it on my hose and forgot to shut off the water supply --- for two months. When I came outside, there wasn't as much as a single drip from the nozzle and when I pushed the lever to the open position, it delivered a steady, powerful stream. Now, the negative. I was looking for a nozzle that would [hopefully] create a small stream that by hydrodynamics would create a stronger/longer flow of water than a conventional nozzle. Sigh, it was just about the same as my regular multi-pattern nozzle. In other words, I don't need this nozzle, even though it is very well built."
5.0,"I have used similar jet heads for years, and concluded that this particular model is the best all around.  The on-off valve works smoothly, the jet spray is perfect for everything from a piercing clean jet to a gentle spray for watering plants.  It works better than brass models that cost much more."
5.0,"Nice simple, cheap nozzle. Produces a strong stream. Not much more you can ask for for the price."
5.0,Well made and works well
4.0,For the money this little jet nozzle is great. No problems so far
5.0,"Works great and inexpensive. I use it at work all the time, slips into a pocket and ready to use. Good spray pattern and the valve holds back our 120psi water pressure."
4.0,ok
5.0,Jet nozzles are necessary and this one works good
3.0,works great use it on 3rd floor windows
5.0,None
5.0,it works.
5.0,Bought 4 more after testing. They are great for a long distance squirt and can adjust for a soft spray. I would definitely recommend.
1.0,With hundreds of common house flies all about for 24 hours and not a single one caught I resorted to a fly swatter and killed 50 or so in 1-2 hours with my old fly swatter. This fly trap appears useless.
1.0,"After a summer grill party where the door was kept open all day/ food was out on the countertops, we developed a horrible fly infestation in our home.  My husband bought this trap and it did not work, not one fly was caught.  I ended up putting a tiny smear of honey on one side and that actually worked, the next day I counted over 30 flies on the thing.  But by itself, it does nothing to 'attract' flies."
4.0,"It was the ""poison-free"" part that attracted me; I don't like spraying bug spray all over my house.  So I bought one of these.  But I have to tell you, I was pretty skeptical.  ""Trap features fly-enticing 3-D design""?  You've gotta be kidding.  These goofy little 3-D boxes are supposed to attract flies?  (Plus, my problem is fruit flies, not houseflies.)

Well, I caught nine fruit flies with it, roughly one per day.  And where do you suppose they landed and got stuck?  Yep, right on those silly pink ""3-D"" boxes, as if they thought they were flying through a tunnel or something.  Don't ask me.  They must be some pretty dumb fruit flies.

Note, however, that if you have that many fruit flies, then you probably have them breeding somewhere, and you just haven't found where yet.  This kind of trap helps you pare them down, but if you have so many that the minute you squash one, you see another, you need to find that they're feeding off of and take care of it first.  I discovered dozens of them in (yuck) a diaper pail, whose contents should've been thrown out long before.  I didn't think fruit flies ate that stuff (well, I guess some of it was fruit once), but now I know.  This trap is good for catching them _after_ you've rooted out the infestation, but it definitely won't stop such an infestation by itself."
1.0,"In the time I spent waiting for my order of these fly traps to arrive, I went out and bought regular fly ribbon for the bad fly problem (not sure what kind of flies - slightly bigger than fruit flies) I was having. In the at least week that I've had one of these fly traps up, I've caught zero flies with this fly trap and have caught probably over 100 flies with the regular fly ribbon. At one point, I even saw a fly on this fly trap and thought it was caught, but now it's gone. I even have pictures to prove it."
5.0,"I bought a few of these after my apartment was infested with fruit flies. After only a few hours, the trap had ""attracted"" many flies and within a few days they were practically gone. This may not be a long term  solution, but if flies are driving you crazy, consider buying this. One  caution- the surface is very sticky, so try to avoid touching it."
5.0,"For the price this is wonderful, and very powerful also. I have tried more expensive nozzles and this has beaten them hands down."
5.0,"Inexpensive, but it works."
5.0,"Using this to back-flush a Sawyer water filter.  Nozzle only weighs 16 grams (with a tiny bit of tubing added to connect to the Sawyer).  This is less than half the weight of the Sawyer syringe and requires no pumping.  It does require a hose or hose-bib, though.

To make one tiny suggestion:  Most brass nozzles of this design have a small ridge at the tip.  This Gilmour tip is tapered and doesn't hold tubing well, especially under pressure.  If Gilmour were to run a new design, a small ridge around the tip would be most helpful."
5.0,"you can buy 100 different nozzles and nothing is as good as this inexpensive piece of plastic. It is by far the best hose nozzle aqfter spending all kinds of money on special nozzles, multi nozzles, nozzle packs etc when this broke it was torture until we found another. love it"
5.0,"My nozzle will be great to  put in my pocket when I am washing flower pots, trash cans, or whatever!
I have a similar one--but it doesn't have the shutoff on it--I love that on this new one."
5.0,Perfect for water balloons. The cheap plastic nozzle that the water balloons came in broke in 30 mins. This is heavy duty plastic and has a valve right at the nozzle. The size is right and you can control the pressure from the valve. Would buy again
5.0,Hard to find plastic nozzle.  We use these nozzles all the time.  They are just as good as any expensive nozzle.  You can adjust the flow of the water easily and it will allow the water to come out fast enough to squirt off your car or porch or whatever.  Also will not corrode like aluminum.  Highly recommend!
4.0,"Works well for a simple nozzle.  Water shuts off without dripping and valve opens and closes easily.  Produces a solid continuous stream and pressure depends entirely on the pressure of the house, no cheating physics here.  Works as described."
4.0,"I purchased a higher powered brass hose nozzle for another hose.  It was great, and I thought this would be a similar sort of thing to use for a coil hose in the backyard.  It is not terribly impressive.  It has a decent water pressure, nothing awesome.  It might be ok to use for very light outdoor cleaning."
4.0,"""Works well, steady high pressure stream.. but doesn't look like it would last through a Season. Should be stainless steel. Otherwise, a must have attachment!"
2.0,"Doesn't seem to work, looks like it keeps the flies away, not catch or kill"
2.0,Does not work indoors.  Hanging for two weeks one fly.
3.0,ok
1.0,"Been hanging up almost 3 weeks and it hasn't caught one darn fly. If I could  give it a zero, thats what I would rate it.."
1.0,"I put three up in different rooms and they did not work at all.  Not a single fly, and the house was full of flies."
1.0,"Fly's all over, but not on this trap.  Interestingly found a fly dead on the floor near the trap, must've been a coincidence.  Other traps from Victor work well, not sure I can recommend this one though."
1.0,Did not attract a single fly
1.0,"In the 3 years they have been hanging in various places, not 1 fly have I ever seen die as a result of this trap.  I have yet to see a fly attracted to it much less stuck to it.  We have poultry so plenty of flies. Not one has even found its way by accident."
1.0,I have had this for a week and it had landed one fly out of several hundred.
3.0,Don't really stay. Keeps falling off when I place it somewhere. Had to tape the bottom
4.0,"Works great, catches flies, lasts a long time.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 simply because of the price.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victor-M500-Poison-Free-Indoor-Fly-Trap/dp/B00002N8SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victor M500 Poison-Free Indoor Fly Trap</a>"
3.0,"If you can't use fly tape this is okay.  It is great for a window sill or on a shelf or something like that,  Otherwise I found that stringing fly tape underneath a desk lamp worked the best.  Left the lamp on 24/7 and the strip was full of flys.  My problem was drain flys and these free standing traps did not work that great.
To eliminate the problem buy Gentrol growth inhibitor in spray cans for the drains.
Hope that helps."
5.0,"Works really well, I have been having fly issues due to a sink pipe that broke. It has been catching them and saves me the time of swatting them!"
4.0,Works well but flimsy hanger
5.0,"Worked great,will definitely buy again!  Amazed how many it attracted and trapped!  Hangs easily and it is not terrible to look at, works like a charm!"
2.0,Not worth the paper its stuck too. didn't catch on fly.
2.0,caught one or two flies when there were a whole bunch of flies who wouldn't leave my kitchen...I ended up swatting more flies than that it
1.0,Does not work at all. 3D pattern was not as shown & didn't attract a single fly. They fly right by it and laugh at you on the way into your house
5.0,Definitely works!
1.0,Get the fly ribbons instead.  They are way cheaper at a store.
3.0,NOT GOOD QUALITY BUT EVENTUALLY IT CAUGHT SOME FLIES
1.0,Up for one week and only two flies stuck to it. And I have a serious fly problem. They aren't even attracted to it
1.0,"This fly trap was worthless.  It was up for two weeks and didn't catch a single fly.  They flew by the thing and laughed.  Loudly!  It did, on its last day, manage to trap one tiny moth, but that poor creature had already been swatted by my eleven year old and its navigation system was damaged.
Seriously, don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
3.0,"Did not have the same effectiveness as last year, I was disappointed."
1.0,what i received is nothing like what is advertized i was expecting a trap not sticky paper. all these are is square tower with sticky paper on it  nut satisfied at all sorry product amazon let me down!!! there won't be many let me downs
1.0,"Very poor quality, the top detached as soon as i took it out of the box."
1.0,Does not work!!!!
4.0,"As a result of a lot of door opening and closing during a barbecue, the house was filled with flies on July 4th. The fly trap was placed near a sunny window the next morning and didn't seem to do anything but then we put it under a lit desk lamp and it  attracted 14 flies in a  matter of a few hours."
1.0,they don't look like their picture and don't work as promised.
1.0,Hard to pull the cover strips off. My hands got pretty sticky doing it. Very cheaply made. The flies are not drawn to it. Don't waste your money.
5.0,Works like a charm. Even caught the movie.
5.0,"used in my computer room flys keep sneaking in this is kinda of attractive, but its hidden in a corner. but it has helped."
5.0,This is one trap that really works!
1.0,I'm laughing so hard. Why would Amazon.com even list this item since no one likes it.
5.0,It was easy to set up and it works great.
5.0,"So I bought one of these and then like 6 of those dollar fly sticks because flies make me crazy and they are all over my house. I read the reviews before buying and so I never hung it, I just layed it across the window. The way the device is built you can lay it on the sill and the glue will not come in contact with your window. I prefer this to the flysticks, because if you don't hang those just stand up, and ours has tipped over a few times which is grossss!

So efficacy: Yes, this thing attracts flies, way more than the standard thing, and I feel like its more stable, so I reccommend this product. Also it looks nicer than the ugly yellow of the fly tape."
4.0,works better than most sticky traps
1.0,Haven't caught one fly.
1.0,It has only caught 6 flies since I hung it up about 3 months ago.
1.0,Total waste of money even hanging it Directly over a fly rea
3.0,"Mine did not come with the ""3d"" design that is featured with this product."
2.0,"Have only caught 2 flies after two months, not a good percentage."
2.0,"didn't attract any flies, not worth the purchase"
1.0,"This doesn't work!!  I even saw a fly land on it and the fly away.  Also, a different design was shipped to me than the one depicted on the website."
1.0,Doesn't work with most flies only the extremely dumb ones. Don't waste your money.
5.0,"I got this to use with a fruit/drain fly problem I have and it's great.  I don't know how well it would work with larger flies, but it gets the little guys really well.  I used to use the rolled up paper but it's messy; this is easier to deal with and you can hang it or place it where the problem is."
4.0,"This was pricey and I didn't think it would work but it does! However, I probably would not buy it again because of the price"
1.0,"I set out two traps when my house had lots of flies.  In two weeks, the traps caught one fly."
5.0,The Flys Loved  it.
1.0,"Out of hundreds that have flown by, only 2 decided to land on this thing, make it uglier and die on it."
2.0,I've had one before and it worked very well for using pesticides on small jobs (my own home.) My kids broke it so I ordered a new one thinking they abused it. Before I could use the new one I dropped it from about 2 feet while empty. The nozzle broke clean off. Very weak design.
5.0,"If you have a lawn or garden then this Chapin is the perfect sprayer! It is lightweight and very easy to use!
It cleans up easily and has lasted a long time.
I used to use the ""BackPack style"" but unless you are fertilizing or Round Up(ing) a field, it was just too much work. This little sprayer
performs great and it's easy to adjust! Even if you have to pump it up 30 times per charge! LOL!
Good luck!
Always, IMHO!"
5.0,"I have quite a bit of houseplants and that's what I use mine for.  Usually for water to spritz on some of my tropical plants throughout the day whenever I pass them buy.  I like this one versus a small spray bottle because spraying all my plants multiple times a day can get a little tiring on my hands and with this I can just pump it a couple times and I'm set.  I'll also use it for a foliar spray when I have compost tea on some of my plants outside and sometimes inside.

I don't remember how much I payed for it but I'm glad I have it handy for my plants.  If someone ever happened to the one I currently have I would probably buy another one."
5.0,"But like any piece of equipment it must be used properly.  It is not designed for painting nor, I believe, for spraying granular slurries (think Ficam). Use it only for water soluble products such as liquid fertilizer and RoundUp.  And the handle is for carrying and aiming, not for twisting of a tight top (gram the large red cap and simply twist.

I had one of these for about 4 years up until an hour ago when the handle did snap off.  But then it is kept outside in all sorts of weather so I'm not surprised. And I did just order a replacement (the whole sprayer).

But to review: I have a bit of acreage and use two small 15 gallon mobile sprayers, one backpack sprayer (for RoundUping fence lines) as well as several 1 and 2 gallon units for general use (not for painting or sealing!).  AND, this little job.  I dedicate it to RoundUp (can you tell I love that product) and leave it on the back porch.  There it is easily accessible (even during cocktail hour) when an errant weed or grass growth is spotted;  grab the sprayer, point and shoot.  Perfect!"
1.0,DOES NOT WORK.  ALL THE PUMPING WILL NOT GET THIS SPRAYER TO SPRAY AN ONCE OF PRODUCT.  THIS IS CRAP
5.0,"I own a pasture sprayer, a couple 2 gallon sprayers and one Chapin Multi-Purpose Sprayer 1002. I bought it about 10 years ago and it is absolutely the best small multi-purpose sprayer I've ever owned. Chapin quality is high. When used as intended it's a champ. I dropped it a couple years ago and broke the nozzle. Amazingly Chapin sells repair parts. I'm about to buy two more one for weed killer and the other for fertilizer. They are so easy to pick up, pump, point and shoot. I feel compelled to empty and clean the 2 gallon ones after each use."
3.0,This gadget seems to work somewhat ok.  Please note that this isn't a regular compressed air cannister - you pump it up and it can spray a little bit; I think it's meant for light painting or something.
2.0,"I was not satisfied with this product. After putting solution in it, closed the cap and used, I tried to twist it off to use again and the handle snapped off, the pressure was not strong at all. I believe the handle should be reinforced with thicker or better material."
1.0,"Like many others, the words ""toxic-free"", ""poison-free"", ""environmentally safe"" and yada yada convinced me to try this product. Our infestation - more like an INVASION - was huge horseflies! We don't even live on or near any kind of livestock or farming area, but every June, these horseflies seem to find some point of entry into our house - by the HUNDREDS. For several days, dozens and dozens just peppered our windows in the upstairs living room and kitchen. Research shows that horseflies like sources of natural light, plus, we figured they were trying to escape.

Bought two two-packs of these clown-colorful and utterly USELESS sticks, and actually hung them IN the window areas, thinking that the horseflies couldn't help but to flit about and finally find themselves stuck to one of the four sides. Well, I gotta give horseflies more credit for their innate intelligence, cuz NOT ONE SINGLE horsefly among HUNDREDS over several days even got stuck on the sticks. In utter frustration, my husband and I just started beating at them with the stick, and then at least a couple of them stuck to it.

Nope. The best fix for eradicating horseflies is to find the SOURCE from which they enter. That took us 4 days of sleuthing before we figured it out: it was the fireplace flue that somehow provides an opening to the outdoors. I actually stood outside and saw them flying INTO the vent. We got cardboard, painter's blue tape, and completely sealed the fireplace up. Voila! Problem solved. Will gladly live without the fireplace year-round if need be.

Now you could also buy some of the ""scented"" devices that would perhaps work better than these sticky sticks? But having read that they mostly reek of a combination of vomit and dog-s****, I knew I didn't want these hanging up in my living room, kitchen or even on the balcony. Next best is your basic FLY SWATTER. Yup, hours of pleasure and satisfaction from nailing these drone-sized flies. But ultimately, you'll get nauseous having to remove all the flattened corpses.

TRY to find the SOURCE of your flies. If you have livestock, horses, or live in areas where these disgusting pests live in great numbers, you may have to take more aggressive measures. But for us, just living in a country-like area, finding the SOURCE of our infestation was the key to eliminating a very gross problem."
1.0,"Bought this recently and what a joke.  Bought it at a store on a whim w/o checking the reviews.  The last few weeks I've been bombarded with flies even with all of the windows and doors closed.  I think they're getting in thru the airs vents.  Anyway after a particularly bad day chasing them around, and after I almost swallowed one that drowned in my ice tea, I decided to do something.

I put these up in two areas where I'd seen these flies frequenting.  The first sign I knew something was wrong was when I looked at the chain holding the trap and there was a fly staring at the trap as if to say ""are you kidding?"".  Two weeks and these traps have not caught one fly!  You'd think maybe that one might hit it by accident because they are right in the flight pattern, but no.  I thought about putting honey on them to attract the flys but then it might attract something else and I create my own flystrips that way  with just a bit of duct tape.  BTW, they say on the box that the flies are attracted to the pattern but not in my area."
4.0,"What else matters. It is a fly trap, so it will look like one when you use it. It does trap flies. There is no odor. And best of all, no chemicals to spray. I have a curious cat, who would be right under my feet if I tried to spray. This would not be in his best interest. Using this fly trap did the job, without the use of spray chemicals."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It is a waste of money. Thought it would work,but all it did was hang there. I even put it on its side and no flies caught."
1.0,"It didn't catch one fly the whole summer.  It's not ugly, so having it hang there didn't bother me, but sheesh... not one fly."
5.0,Love these things.  They work really well.  Been using them for years.  Be careful though- I've gotten my hair stuck in them before because I walked right into it.  Verrrry sticky.
1.0,i placed it in my office for 2 month. did not catch single one. need improvement. I waste my money.
1.0,I have had these hanging for well over a week and they do not have one single fly trapped. I am not the least bit impressed with this supposed trap.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This product IS A FRAUD
It has been 2 weeks and it has only 1 fly on it.
Fly paper would work 100 times better"
1.0,"Watched a fly land on it and walk off of it. Don't waist your money, seriously! Very deceptive of the company to put out a product like this. I would not buy anything from them."
3.0,"The feeder itself is just fine.  No better or worse than similar suet feeders I've tried.  Unfortunately, after less than three months, the chain is already rusted.  For that reason, I wouldn't purchase it again."
4.0,"You get what you pay for.  Sometimes come open under aggressive feeding.  A good deal for the price though, and I continue to get good use out of the half dozen tacked to posts around my back yard."
4.0,"This feeder is easy to open and stays closed when the suet cake is inserted. The animals cannot open it, plus it is light and can be hung anywhere."
5.0,Just a normal suet feeders still going strong after a year. The birds love it and I loved the price. This is a good feeder for those of you who want to please the birds and your wallet all at the same time!
5.0,"The Squirells and Birds Love it!!!

Only problem here is that I may have not purchased enough to last since it is going so fast."
3.0,"Very simple, cheap, and easy, it would seem this feeder would be perfect.  I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)

UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).  They do eat the one in the cage, and maybe would use it more if I didn't have better alternatives right there.  For the price it's ok I guess, but I don't think I'd buy again."
4.0,i ordered 2 of these and they came quickly...one of them had a bad latch and I'm sure if I had contacted them they would have sent me another...just seemed like alot of trouble for an inexpensive item....they wouldn't have known the latch was bad because they are enclsed in plastic...everything else was otherwise very good.
5.0,Birds seem to use these with the citrus suet blocks more then my feeders. Of course this is winter and possibly the birds need the fat more. Economical and bird's favorite what more could I want!
3.0,The bigger birds had some problems landing  and staying on this feeder to feed off  the standard sized suet cake I put in it. Smaller birds were not interested. Maybe it would work if you had enough patience. The suet cake was in it for about a week and a half after which I decided to chuck it before it rotted. But the feeder works for putting halved unshelled peanuts for some small birds that steadily work on it. I had to modify the feeder. The holes are too big so I made them smaller by weaving thick transparent nylon threads through them. They are flexible so the birds are able to tease out the peanuts. Not great but at least it's not a total waste. It works for some specific birds that I want to feed undisturbed by the bigger more aggressive birds. The feeder is cheap stuff but easy to manipulate.
1.0,Flies were in no way attracted to this thing I had it in the kitchen and got 1 fruit fly. Then I tried the living room and it stayed there for over a week before I threw it away!
2.0,"I had to place it right above my trash can just to justify the purchase, up till now, it couldn't trap a fly. maybe i don't have the kind of flies it was produced for."
3.0,If a fly flies directly onto the thing it will stick and then die. But those stupid little black flies don't seem to be naturally attracted to it.
1.0,3 weeks no catches!!!! waste of time and $$$ !!! its only good for sticking to your fingers while hanging it up.
1.0,"This product just doesn't work for me.  I have placed this near an area with many flies, but it has not caught a single fly in several days of use."
1.0,BOUGHT BECAUSE I SEEN & READ GOOD REVIEWS & THEY MOST OF BEEN LIES & THEY MOST OF WANTED PEOPLE TO GET DUKE INTO BUYING IT LIKE THEY DID!! IT DOSE NOT CATCH ANYTHING BUT HAIR
1.0,Had the Victor Fly Traps hanging for 2 weeks and saw a fly rest on the trap and fly away. WORTHLESS!!!
1.0,"After a couple of weeks with one or more flies buzzing around the room constantly, this ""trap"" has caught exactly none.  My ""detailed and specific"" comment is that it just doesn't work -- at least for me."
2.0,We hung this along with fly strips. The fly strips cost less and caught lots of flies. This did not catch a single one
3.0,We have had this thing hanging in our office about 3-4 weeks now. Many annoying flies and other critters have come and gone but there is only a single dead fly stuck to this thing.  The rest of the critters we have had to use fly swatters on.
5.0,have three now and the birds are happy! Easy for them to hang on and they stay locked!
4.0,This is a good feeder the only problem I had was it was too easy for sparrows and other small birds to cling onto and eat.  Too many birds would cling onto it and the same time. It does help feed the birds and give them all a great chance to eat and enjoy the suet!
4.0,Keeps the pigeons away and finches don't try and turn it into permanent housing like a birdhouse lol
5.0,"Seems sturdy, opens fairly easily, but is stiff enough that there is no problem with it becoming open when birds hang on it.very nice."
4.0,I really like them. The only problem was that the hanging hook doesn't work well so I had to use a different one.
5.0,It does its job.
5.0,Nice suet feeder. Easy to fill.  Plastic coated easy to clean. Good price
4.0,"I always use these suet feeders, and although I have a problem getting them latched after a few uses, there is no other way to design the latching piece. I even make my own suet now, because the birds eat it so quickly, and it fits perfectly in this holder. BTW:  I coat the suet with hot red pepper, and no squirrel ever comes back twice!  They hate red pepper."
5.0,"Product is well made, arrived as promised, and was well packaged.  I am using it for nesting materials (i.e. cotton balls and yarn strips) for the birds.  This is the first year I've tried and the birds love it!"
5.0,Great!  Used to attract several types of birds
5.0,the birds love it
5.0,Awesome !
5.0,Use it everyday. No problem. Strong and durable.......and I found NOTHING is squirrel free!!!!
5.0,Does what it's supposed to do...the birds love it.
5.0,Just what I wanted
4.0,"Pretty large. Good for hanging outside or in a bigger aviary. No good for a large parakeet cage, takes up too much room. Easy to open and close."
5.0,birds like it
5.0,Birds loving it..squirrels also!
5.0,The birds love it and that's good enough for me.
5.0,Very nice and functional! I like it :-)
1.0,"I bought 2 of these despite the bad reviews thinking maybe they would work for my situation. I placed them in a fly infested area inside a building and have not caught one single fly on either trap in days. My milk jug trap is catching flies outside the building, and my Starbar Bite Free Stable Fly traps are working like a champ for biting flies outside in the kennel runs, but these Victor M500 traps are a joke. Save your money and steer clear of these. I could catch more flies with double sided tape and a piece of bread.

1 week update: Still not even one fly after 1 week in an area with plenty of HOUSE flies. There is one gnat that must have stumbled across and accidentally got in the trap. Must've tripped! I will be updating my review weekly to reiterate why not to buy these. I am having excellent success with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FARNAM-3004323-2-Pack-EZ-Fly-Trap-12-Ounce/dp/B000A6VOK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FARNAM 3004323 2-Pack EZ Fly Trap, 12-Ounce</a>."
1.0,this did not work well at all. I had them out for 1 month and got maybe 2 flies.  Not worth the money.  Did not catch flies or any bugs for that matter.
1.0,"I live in Northern California and in the summer we get annoying flies in the kitchen. After a week, I had to hunt down the flies myself and swat them. I hung this on the door in the kitchen and no flies were caught."
5.0,"I bought this item four years ago to get rid of small flies. I left it in the kitchen, and it did attract a few of the flies which were also attracted to the light of my computer screen in another room.

I moved the fly trap to a spot near my PC. Lo and behold, termites started swarming from a nearby walk-in closet a few days later. (Unknowingly, a wooden shelf left by the previous owner of my condo was their breeding ground.) The termites - 50 or more - immediately flew to the fly trap and, of course, were stuck. I discarded the shelf and have seen neither termites nor their droppings since.

However,I have seen a few flies lately. So I'm buying another."
5.0,This works just as it should. I would love poison on it but whatever.  Just catch a few and the rest either want to eat their buddies or just hang out I'm not sure. :)
5.0,After several assault parties with flyswatters we turned to some other technique. After a day of hanging two of these the fly population has all but disappeared....NOW we can get the remainder!
5.0,Would buy again - worked well!!  I put these inside the planter and it took care of the gnat problem.
2.0,wasn't worth even the money spent. poorly made item and didn't really work on catching flies. was wasted effort in even buying.
1.0,"I had an infestation in my house ! Every day at noon flies in the hundreds enetered through the kitchen window and a black cloud of buzz-buzz hovered over my sink. I obviously kept the windows shut, but a handful of flies still managed to get in. I put up this trap, and not even ONE fly got caught in it... Very disappointing :("
3.0,"The picture was a bit misleading. I thought it was a trap where flies entered inside and were trapped, like a roach motel. When I received it, the design looked different, and it was obvious that it was a a square ""tube"" coated with very sticky adhesive, where the flies land and stick. As such, it works but not exactly what I expected. I would have designed it differently, though and put the adhesive on the inside and entrance holes on the outside so it doesn't look so ugly when the flies are caught."
5.0,Works well.  Refilled multiple times a month.
4.0,"It fits every suet I've ever bought and the cage holds up to the elements just fine. However, squirrels and raccoons can and will open it and make off with the suet so you'll want to use some wire to secure the top flap or hang it on a feeder that they can't get to."
1.0,These feeders are available in the store for $1.65 (Tractor Supply) and around $2.50 at Home Depot.  $7.83 would be a good price for 8 of them as is hinted at by the listing of S-1-8 since the model is actually S-1
1.0,"When I opened the feeder I found that there was a very short hanging chain and no hook.  Basically it was unusable by me.  I bought another one locally so I could ascertain there was a 3-4"" chain and a hook"
5.0,This Suet hanger is easy to open and easy to hang.it makes a great addition to my bird feeders. The green color blends with nature.
4.0,"We hung this from a tree with a ""S"" hook and it works really well.  Has not been tested through a windy storm yet."
3.0,"IT';S  nice and sturdy and the hinge is good, but it did not include suet as advertised, so I was disappointed in that"
5.0,"I like this type of feeder as it is a good value, it does the job well and
is price well. It is efficient product for suet cake dispensing. Recommend."
5.0,"Well constructed and a very nice price.  Easy to open and close.  Lightwieght and easy to fill.  Good color, blends well with the terrain."
4.0,"I purchased two Heath suet cake feeders last winter and I used them from December through March of this year. The following report is how they held up.

The metal chain that connects the wire frame of the feeder to the metal hook at the other end became tarnished during the winter. The manufacturer could have used stainless steel chain instead of coated steel. The cost would have been minimal for this change. If this matter isn't addressed properly, your suet feeder my wind up on the ground someday. In my case I cleaned the chain with a fine steel brush, clean the chain with some alcohol and allowed the chain to dry. I applied two coats of a clear acrylic spray paint (Krylon Crystal Clear 1301) to the chain allowing the first coat to dry properly before applying a second coat. This should protect the chain for many years. If the tarnish is noticed in the future, the chain can be clean with a steel brush and repainted. If you have just recently purchased this item, I would clean the chain with alcohol and spray it twice.

Commercial suet cakes leave behind a greasy deposit on the bottom of the feeder. I found the easiest way of to remove the grease is with Gojo hand cleaner and a plastic brush. Apply some Gojo to your plastic brush and then scrub your feeder. Finally, rinse with water and you are done. To avoid this greasy deposit you can make an aluminum boat for your feeder. Take a sheet of aluminum foil and fold it several times. Now start shaping the folded aluminum to make a boat that will fit in the bottom the feeder. Now when you want to use your feeder, the suet cake is placed in the aluminum boat where most of the grease will accumulate. At the end of your feeding system, you can throw the boat away.

Finally, I notice that large birds (mockingbirds, jays, robins) have a hard time trying to feed on the suet cake while hanging on one side. These birds long tail feathers are not anchored to anything and the birds start to turn upside down which they do not like. For my bird feeders, I made an inexpensive tail feather anchor. I had some scrap 3/4 thick exterior plywood (you could also use pine board) and cut it approximately to the dimensions of the feeders (5 x 5). Do not use particle board since it is not waterproof and will swell up when exposed to water and then fall apart.

I used aluminum straps to attach my wooden tail feather anchor to the feeder. You could also use plastic shipping straps (these straps are used to hold together large cardboard boxes and are often thrown away once the cardboard box is open). You will two straps, 5/8 wide and 5-6 long. For plastic straps you need to have a round hole at each end to attach it to your wooden anchor. Holes can easily be made by heating under a flame a large nail and pushing it through the plastic strapping. The nail will melt a hole for you. If you use metal straps, try to use aluminum. I had scrap aluminum from a company that was installing a new aluminum gutter for a home. Once I cut the aluminum to size, I drill a hole at each end of the strap.

Bend the straps in a u-shape and open the feeder. Push the ends of the strap through the holes of the feeder so the strap overlaps two consecutive feeder cage wires. This is done at each end of the feeder. Your wooden anchor is pressed along the outside bottom of the feeder with a strap end on each side. One strap end is screwed into the wooden anchor (I used 10 x  pan head screws). Then the block and the feeder are turned around to expose the other strap end. If the strap is plastic, pull tight on the strap and screw the other strap end. Now do the same procedure for the second strap. If you use a metal strap, you may need to squeeze the straps over the wooden anchor with pliers to get a tight fit. And a metal strap may stick up along the inside bottom of the feeder. You can flatten the strap with a long wide blade flat screwdriver and a hammer. Rest the bottom of the wooden anchor on a solid surface, pass the screwdriver blade through the feeder wiring and press it against the top of the metal strap. Tap the other end of the screwdriver with a hammer and the aluminum will flatten out against the feeders wire cage.

Once you are satisfied with the wooden anchor, unscrew the straps and paint the anchor. Apply at least one coat of primer paint and allow it to dry for 24 hours. I next apply an exterior house paint to the anchor and allow that to dry 24 hours. Reassembly your anchor to the suet feeder being careful of the orientation. Finally Spray paint the exposed metal screws used to fasten the straps  I used a clear acrylic spray. This will stop the screws from rusting on you.

And now you are finished. This suet feeder should last a long time! Just remember, your suet feeder is heavier now (with a wooden block attached to it). Make sure your mounting point is strong enough to hold it."
1.0,"I put this fly trap in the kitchen and didn't catch a single fly.  We only have flies in late August and September when the temperature warms.  So we don't have window screens.  The flies were especially bad this year, so I tried the Victor fly trap because I like their rat and mouse traps and didn't want to spray in the kitchen.
Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I caught many flies with a little milk in the bottom of a small water bottle.  They flew in and drowned themselves. I don't think California flies are smarter than any others so the trap just doesn't work."
1.0,It never caught even one fly.  We got it for inside and left it out for a week.  The flies were not interested.  It's Useless!
1.0,What a horrible product. First of all the item does not work. I have had it up for a week with lots of flies around it and they simply avoid it. Infact the will sit on the window next to it but never go to it. Also it does no look like the one pictured You get the idea that there are small boxes for the flies to enter. Not so. Mine came with black and pink srips running from the top to the bottom. WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,"Flies buzz around this thing like its not even there. So many flies around, I'd think by luck a fly would have at least bounced off it and stuck by pure luck. Not a single fly caught, still flies annoyingly buzzing around the area.. Did NOT catch a single fruit fly, house fly, horse fly, mosquito or even a hungry spider or ant. Its a cardboard box worth about a nickel sprayed with some sticky stuff and this company is just laughing to the bank with our $7.
-- Chicago, Illinois"
1.0,Let's put in this way.  Flies stay on these traps and left.  It looks like a safe island to flies.
1.0,"Please do not waste your money. This Fly trap is absolutely useless. I bought two of  this product for the kitchen, we always BBQ and go in and out by the Pool and fly's get in the House. We have started to make jokes about his product not ONE Fly so far has gone on both of them since i hang it up 2 weeks ago :) Terrible Product!"
1.0,"Placed around the house for several days, setup a fly attracting trap in vicinity. literally watched the flies avoid this trap. after 2 days I was excited to see one lil'bugger land on the surface, only to be disappointed when I approached to examine and he flew away! the paper is tacky when the pressure of a human finger is applied, but for most small flies it is hardly a trap."
4.0,"I've been nurturing a plant at work and it was doing so well I decided to repot to a larger pot. I must have gotten some funky soil because as soon as I repotted, we were being overrun by a large colony of small flies. I was swatting them and getting bug guts on my hand so frequently I stopped bothering with the ""gross!"" exclamations. The fact that in the city of San Francisco, you have to compost just aggravated the situation.

I bought one of these nitfy traps and set it by my plant and voila! Instead of my hands getting the daily dose of bug guts, the trap is now lined with the tiny suckers! It's been a few months and the trap is pretty much covered (the gross part) and I need to order another one. Not sure how well this will work on larger inserts but it works really well on these tiny, annoying flies."
1.0,The only thing this item trapped was a few fruit flies.  It didn't work at all as a fly trap.  I wouldn't recommend it.
5.0,I am so happy with this Item. I had too many flies that were disturbing in my kitchen. I put the product near the window and it works fantastically
3.0,"So I can turn the tip of the sprayer all the way and it will still spray. I bought 3 bottles and 1 is defective, it always leaks, Pissed me off because I lost half of my product that was inside because it leaked. The other 2 are still holding, we will see how long. Probably will not buy it again and will try the IK Foam when these get tossed."
5.0,Works great! Ive had several over the years and this is best Ive used in a long while. Holds the pressure good
5.0,"nice fog of spray, handy size, as described, good price, promptly shipped"
1.0,Used once with natural weed killer. Wont pump again. Trigger malfunctioning.
5.0,Great spray bottle. Perfect for the small jobs on our patio.
5.0,Bought this to replace my old one.... again.  This is the 4th total I have owned.  If you take good care of it you will get a year out of it. What fails is the spray lever. Eventually it sprays less and less. You can push super hard with both thumbs closer to the center and spray better but that gets old. For the price it is a good product.
5.0,"excellent product, doesnt leak at all and does what it is designed to do very well, I have other hand sprayers that leak from different spots but not this one and I've had it for a couple years and I use it on a regular basis."
2.0,"I have 2 full size Chapin pump sprayers that perform very well.  Bought the little hand pump, it performed well, so I bought 3 more to have one for each type of product I use.  None of the 3 worked - the first one still does.  The defective ones hold pressure and spray effectively for about 30 seconds and then just dribble.  No adjustment I made was effective."
5.0,Cool sprayer but it seems like you have to really tighten the lid down for it to build pressure I fill like its going to brake
5.0,"I was a little apprehensive when I first poured water into this sprayer, wondering how it would build up enough pressure to actually spray.  Well, no worries!  This is the best sprayer I have ever used in many years.  Easy to pump the top and the sprayer nozzle is adjustable ... very fine mist, fine mist, small stream.  Now I have to buy another one to keep my husband from taking mine! He uses his in the shop - perfect for misting garden seedlings, or spraying wet paint off the screwdriver!"
2.0,We have so many flies in the house.  Have had this product for 3 weeks and it has only stuck 1 fly thus far.
1.0,"I wish I'd read the reviews before making this purchase. It's basically a cardsotck box that is sticky all over the OUTSIDE. Those pink-ish things that look like entrances ""into"" the trap? They're just pictures. There *is no* inside of the trap. All the flies will be stuck to the OUTSIDE. It's basically fly paper, just horribly, horribly HORRIBLY overpriced.

Do yourself a favor and just get fly paper or fly strips. Same yuck factor, but much cheaper."
1.0,"After a week of hanging up right in the middle of the swarm of flies on my basement, it hasn't caught a single fly. The flies are constantly flying all around both of these that I hung, and I'd be flabbergasted if some weren't bumping into it even just by random accident, but not a single one has stuck to it. Don't buy these!"
1.0,Worst product I have gotten in long time. Would rate it as no star if I could.  Simply did not catch a single fly or bug of any sort.  Went to the hardware store and bought the old-fashioned spiral fly paper which was very effective.  Had an unuasual influx of flys in the house this fall and needed to do something.
1.0,"I had an infestation of fruitflies, they were literally everywhere flying around me in my  kitchen, so I bought this product hoping to at least get rid of a few. But after 2 weeks, only 1 fly had stuck... I was going around with a notepad and squishing the buggers myself with a success rate of 2-3 a day so clearly this product was useless! I even dabbed to red wine and banana to the top of the column after 1 week because they were really attracted to any red wine I had in a glass... but still it did nothing to get them stuck. And then I actually saw a second fly land on it once, and I watched as it flapped it's wings frantically and within 30 secs it had unstuck itself!!!! This product was a total waste of money!"
1.0,"If I could rate this fly trap lower than one star, I would.  I think flies have come from miles away just to come in and laugh at this thing.  I'd have more success taking the flies into a vat of scalding water than getting a fly to randomly run into this box of ridiculousness.
WASTE OF $$!"
1.0,"bought this awhile ago, decided to review it now.  this thing sucks.  there has been flies caught on this, but took over a year to get maybe, 10 or so tiny microscopic flies.  no regular flies that you can see with your eyes.  i still have it up, only cause it catches flies a few times a year.  maybe i should let those little things fly around, or i could get a real fly trap, that actually works. :)"
2.0,Used this fly sticky tape trap in the garage where we had a knat fly problem. We also had some fruit fly type  bugs flying around also. Our neghbor has a big fig tree that isn't pruned of taken care of and all the figs stay on the tree and rot till they dry. Smells really bad and attracts the flys that go into our garage because of its proximity to our garage. We put these up and only caught about 3 to four on each one. We had better results with the sticky traps that unravel. These caught much more knats.
1.0,I ordered two of these and placed one in the narrow laundry room just inside the back door where all the flies come into the house (I leave the back door open for my two dogs to go in and out of the house when I'm home.) and put another one in the kitchen where the flies hang out while I'm cooking.  Apparently Colorado flies are far too smart to get close to these things.  I have not caught ONE.  The only way these 'traps' are going to eliminate flies in my house is if the flies die laughing.
3.0,"Like others have said, hanging this up is useless. You have to lie it down in an area where the flies like to land. I have caught dozens and dozens of flies with this, however I have noticed that some of these traps are stickier than others. The flies in my house also seem to have figured out how to basically ""walk"" down the trap until they get to the end, where they can get unstuck and fly off. Maybe 25% of the flies escape, and the others are trapped. I actually have taken to pressing the flies into the trap once they land, to try to keep them from escaping, but this is disturbing and I'd rather not have to do that. The Catchmaster Window glue trap is really superior to this product by comparison (but is currently unavailable...)."
5.0,It is easy to assemble and easy to use. That is all you can ask for a product like this.
5.0,Much easier than using trigger spray! Does not have a super fine mist but works perfectly
2.0,Tiring
5.0,"Works great!  At first glance, thought it needed a hose - nope.  You pump the top thing to pressurize and spray by holding down the lever on top.  Just be sure to screw the top on tight.  If it's a little loose, it'll leak and not build up pressure."
5.0,very good
5.0,"The sprayer is great, I use it for cleaning cars and spraying degreaser. Much easier than pulling a trigger all the time to spray.

On a side note, the seller or amazon just slapped the amazon sticker right on the bottle. Doesnt affect the product so Im still leaving it at 5 stars, but it was annoying to get off since it came off in small pieces."
5.0,"good price, works fine"
5.0,"This Chapin sprayer is as easy to use as it is affordable.  The pressure pump works well, no leakage, and you don't have to lock it down.  It is not to heavy when full to hoId without needing a shoulder strap. I use it along with my new Hoover shampooer on the low-pile carpet, because the Hoover's water dispenser makes it too wet.  After regular vacuuming I turn the Chapin sprayer to a mist setting and use diluted carpet cleaning liquids to moisten sections of carpet.  After a few minutes I suction it up with the Hoover.  This way the carpet is dry in a few minutes instead of a few hours, and I can do the whole house in one day."
1.0,Arrived in a beat to crap box
1.0,Junk. Pumped and pumped and it would not build up any pressure. Returning it.
5.0,Great pump sprayer to use to touch up paint on the boulders on my Koi Pond
1.0,"Okay so I have a little garden in my back yard that attracts a lot of flies and I have been looking for a way to combat them once they are in the house. I wasn't sure if they still made Fly Paper but when I saw this after searching in the great Amazon I was excited. From the moment I opened the box I was dismayed and I seriously cannot decide if this is a joke or not. The packaging says the box has stunning 3-d images to draw in the flies, these images are perhaps the funniest drawing's I have ever seen being called 3-d...this product has not caught a single fly they simply ignore it and fly everywhere but at the stunningly realistic 3-d images anyone got a better idea?

DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS PLAYING A joke on someone"
1.0,This is nothing more than a cardboard box with a little dry adhesive on the outside. It does nothing to attract flies and the adhesive is not gluey enough to trap them if they do happen to land on it. Save your money.
1.0,"After two weeks, I decided to check on the fly trap. I expected to find at least 100 dead flies.

But what I found was a single dead fly, I guess It died a lonely death.

My backyard is infested with literally thousands of flies, but somehow all the flies magically flew around this fly trap.

Spending $6.08 is too much just to kill a single fly. I could have saved money by killing one manually with a fly swatter."
1.0,"I'm fairly certain that once caught, the flies are supposed stay stuck. Not so much with this trap. It's become part of our daily routine to compare how many flies there are on it in morning with how few are left in the afternoon. About 50% of them escape from it."
1.0,"This product does not work at all. I hang it in the kitchen for 5 days but no fly has been attracted!

It doesn't worth the time and money to return it. But please, buyer beware, I strongly suggest you go find some other item."
5.0,"These traps work great -- lying down. If you try to hang them, they are useless. We had them hanging for days and nothing...and then one fell. It caught 6 flies in 10 minutes that way. I think the flies like to land ON it, not fly into it.  We put them at the bottom of our windows and on counters near food.  Catches them all the time.."
1.0,I don't know how this product performs with big flies but it sucks with fruit flies.
1.0,"For something that was supposed to attract them, The flys couldn't have cared less. In about a months time it caught maybe 10 flies which sure were only a miniscule fraction of those in the kitchen! Was a waste of money."
1.0,"We had a problem with a lot of fruit flies in our kitchen.  I picked up one of these to take care of business despite spotty reviews.  Oops.

We had it up for several days and I saw one fly land on it the entire time.  The best part of this tragic story is that when I picked up the trap to investigate the one trapped fly...I'l be darned if that fly didn't pick up his feet and take off. That's right, the fly flew away after landing on this.  None of the other flies in the area even bothered.

They should call this the ""sucker"" trap.  The sucker in this case would be me.  Save your money and invest in quicker hand reflexes."
1.0,They should call it the NO FLY TRAP. I put where I had alot of flies and it did not work.
5.0,Works great for disbursing weed killer with narrow or wide spray.  Highly recommend.
5.0,nice sprayers
5.0,This is a great little sprayer!! Have several Chapin products and they are all made well and work great. Thanks!
5.0,This sprayer is easy to use and is a great addition to my gardening needs!
5.0,I use few of these for different reason they are wonderful .
5.0,Great sprayer. The handheld pump adds great pressure.
5.0,I live on the beach and I purchased this to clean my patio windows and it works perfectly.
5.0,"Purchased two, use one for detailing spray and the other witg an alcohol mix for panel prep prior to sealants and waxes.  Works great with all plastic design so no risk of rusty parts!"
5.0,Work perfect for auto body.
5.0,"Versatile little hand sprayer! I have used it over the months for different tasks and it has held up perfectly.

- Use #1: Living in an apartment, it was quite the challenge when it came to washing my motorcycle given that I did not want to haul buckets of water up and down stairs multiple times. This bottle stores enough water to allow me to pre-soak my motorcycle and then rinse it off after I soap it up.
- Use #2 : I use it to water my baby plants on my balcony. With the fine mist setting, it does not damage my plants not lift up the potting soil.
- Use #3: Using the measuring marks, mixed up some vinegar and water to clean my outside windows. With the stream setting and pressure provided, I was able to reach the far out windows and get all the gunk off."
3.0,"I don't really think that the design of the cardboard box makes one bit of difference to the flies. House or fruit flies. Flies land on pretty much anything. With sufficient time flies flying around randomly and landing randomly around the house. Eventually they'll land on the fly trap.

Perhaps after the first few have landed and died on the trap the rest will be attracted to the scent of the dead flies? Directly out of the box, I don't think there is anything on it that is an attractant."
3.0,"The Victor Poison-Free M500 Indoor Fly Trap appears to be something that attracts and traps flies, but what it really is is a box with fly paper on it.  It worked well in catching the fruit flies I had, but isn't exactly what I expected."
5.0,Very impressed - the one I put up in our basement is a fly graveyard now after only a few days (they are really bad this year for some reason). I'm ordering a couple more just so I have them in reserve.
1.0,"Ineffective and worthless. I bought this product for indoors and two other outdoor fly traps.  The outdoor traps worked immediately and I have noticed less flies in my home from my backdoor over the past week.  However, this indoor trap has caught zero flies yet over one week, while the outdoor traps have caught a combined 75-100.  I get excited looking at the trap thinking a fly was caught, but then realize that is the picture of a fly instead:-(.  Don't waste your money on this product."
5.0,"Having used traditional fly rolls in the past, I was dubious when my hubby opened up the box and showed me this little stand-alone cardboard fly trap. We were desperate, though, as we had a full-on gnat invasion in our kitchen. We put it in a few places on the counter before settling on one near the coffee pot where the gnats seemed to love to gather. At first they seemed to ignore it, but over the next few days, more and more were finding their way onto the trap. At one point we gave up counting--there were dozens. This product is great for ridding yourself of those pesky gnats. I love that it is poison-free and that it can stand on the countertop if you want it to, as our very tall ceilings would make a hanging strip less than useful. But for those wishing to hang it, there's a little hanger included as well. I can't make a claim about larger flies, we didn't catch any of those--there were none around. And I think there would be better choices for outdoors than this product. But for the $$ this little fly trap did the job we asked it to do, and you can't beat that!"
4.0,"Well I received the item and placed it in the same area where we had put fly paper before-we had far fewer victims than with the regular fly paper and it looks like it doesn't really catch ""the big ones"" like the fly paper did. However, for the price it is decent and looks more attractive than the regular strip of fly paper."
1.0,"The picture shown is not the item you get.  The one you get is made out of thick white paper/thin cardboard with pictures of flies and 3D pink boxes on it (under the sticky stuff).  It catches fruit flies and gnats just fine, but anything larger can get out and the flies aren't even interested.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Well, I purchased 3 as they were inexpensive and I figured for the shipping, I might as well. I have two up in to different areas of my small apartment and after 24 hours, nothing. I've managed to kill some flies but that was only by me swatting at them."
1.0,"Even the cheap 'ribbon' traps have caught many dozens of flies in the few days I've had them, and the liquid bait traps (Rescue, and Victor's Fly Magnet) have caught hundreds in a few days, but this thing remains empty (the best seems to be the Rescue trap, I call ""the stinker"", because it reeks, but it works). This trap is in the same space as the other traps, and there are hundreds of flies out there. Just does not work. While it is an ""indoor"" trap, the directions say that it can be used outdoors if protected by weather, which it is."
5.0,"This sly trap is attractive to look at, works well, and has no odor. I recommend it!"
5.0,"My wife and I needed to put in a new lawn as the old one was over 25 years old and gophers and weeds finally won the battle so we started over.  We had to rearrange the sprinkler system and rototil the area three times.  Once leveling was done we put down the seed and topper and put together the roller which took all of fifteen min.  While I put the finishing touches on the topper my wife filled the roller.  It worked great and in no time the job was finished.  The roller arrived a day ahead of time and was so easy to put together.  There was no sign of the drum leaking or any kind of leaking.  It was easy to use and for the price you just can't beat this deal.  Thank you Amazon for having this vender and thank Agri-fab for making a great product.
butch"
5.0,"Solid, exactly what I was expecting."
5.0,"Super stoked.  Where I live I couldn't find this piece of equipment anywhere.  Honestly, I'm pretty surprised that I was able to get it so quickly and at such a reasonable price.  Everything arrived fine and I assembled it in less than 30 minutes while watching NBA playoffs. Once it was all together it seems to be just what I ordered.  I should be able to try it out here in the next few weeks."
3.0,"Light-weight, easy to assemble but not real heavy duty structure.  Bad seal for the roller...leaks!"
3.0,"Either my yard is a little too firm, or this item isn't heavy enough.  The bung is a little awkward, but seems to work fine.  It was assembled by two 13-year-olds."
5.0,"Presently I am cultivating a 4' x 100' strip for reseeding. I wanted a roller to insure the soil would be compacted properly.
I am in the process of doing this now and the unit is functioning very well. After this there will be other uses for this roller
and I am sure I will be pleased with the results."
3.0,Had a small pin hole leak in the seam around bung. Jb weld fixed it. Would have returned if not such a hassle to disassemble and box up.
2.0,Works fine except that it developed 2 leaks after first use. Small leaks but still leaks.  Contacted agri fab but have not heard back from them after 1 week.
2.0,parts bag was open.. missing parts
5.0,Used to pack Bocce Ball Court
5.0,well described & excellent quality & best price found . . . . . . . . . . .
3.0,"This handle fits and works alright, and it was cheap. Unfortunately, it is not nearly of the quality of the original handle. I sure wish I hadn't leaned on that handle as hard as I did. This new handle is not only the wrong color (the original was red and silver) but the ferrule fits kind of poorly and the handle is just a touch loose. One of my clients has a Seymour fork of the same model as mine and he also had to replace the handle with the Link (You can't get the original style handle from Seymour) and his handle is just like mine, which is to say, it's OK, I guess."
5.0,"spraying nicely after more than a month. my wife says ""who knew squeezing a trigger was such a pain!"" She loves it."
5.0,It works so well that it leaves me misty!
5.0,Works great for so many things - from cleaning my boat to showering while camping.
5.0,This is good.  Way better than continually pumping with the usual spray bottles
2.0,"Arrived with the nozzle broken, which needs something like sugru to fix"
5.0,Best trigger sprayer ever
1.0,Product came defective.
2.0,this didn't produce a fine mist like i was hoping.  It worked more like a diaphragm/ garden sprayer
5.0,"We've tried a lot of sprayers over the years, this is easily the most durable and highest quality."
4.0,Did not know you have to pump it first.  BUt it really works well
5.0,The Agri-Fab lawn roller functioned well and set up was easy.
5.0,purchased as a long awaited Christmas gift for hubby. Our lawn needs leveling in a lot of spots and we wanted one to keep not rent.
1.0,"Part arrived with water in the barrel, metal posts outside the barrel were rusted, missing crossbeam, liquid residue all over barrel and remaining parts.

No idea where this happened from, be it amazon, or MFG.... but I do not appreciate getting a used piece of merchandise for the price of new. Could have gotten this on craigslist for half the cost."
5.0,We have three piece of equipment from this company and each one has met our needs .  This one still in box but sure it will be as good as others
5.0,"i should have bought one years ago! i have been renting one whenever i needed it and could find one, then take it back and pay rent at $25.00 a day plus my time and gas. this roller is made better than some and equal to any i have ever used.  the price was great and my wife uses it ""for a chair"". thanks  pap.. in sc"
5.0,An excellent item. Very light when empty and easy to use when filled with water. It does a fantastic job and is not subject to rust as my previous roller. Well worth the cost.
2.0,"The Good:  It works!!  Seemed well constructed, BUT, now the not-so-good: It leaks!! I contacted Agri-Fab about the fact that the poly drum leaks water around the shaft/drum interface which was observed during the first filling.  I was advised that this was not normal and that while Agri-Fab warranted the lawn roller for one year, it excluded the poly roller from the warranty.  That excludes the only component in this device that has a chance of problems in my opinion.  BTW, I could not find any mention of a warranty in the documentation that accompanied the roller.  I was advised by Agri-Fab that I should return the lawn roller to the retailer for replacement.  I advised Agri-Fab that I had purchased the device through Amazon and that a return would be difficult, as that although my possession of the item was for only about a month, I had discarded the rather massive box that it was shipped in.  I was given a supposed Amazon phone number that might assist a resolution with this issue, which after a 24 hour, 20-30 attempt (always busy) I have given up on.  Agri-Fab supplied me with a PO number that Amazon had given them apparently authorizing them to drop ship the item to me.  It was timely that the day after my Agri-Fab exchange, Amazon asked for my review of this product.  So, here it is! I have used Amazon many times and find them outstanding as an on-line vendor; however I believe that they should clearly state how these kinds of issues should be handled.  While the leak is not large and I hope will not get worse, this adventure has been a little unsettling."
4.0,"I am well pleased with the product.  Delivery was superior.  Assembly was easy with excellent directions.  This purchase was a very pleasant, satisfying experience."
5.0,The Roller work well for what I purchased it for. I purchased it to roll out Mole tracks and it did the job fine.
5.0,This lawn roller was exactly what I needed when I planted my new lawn.  It is easy to use and does help keep the grass seed from blowing away while it is establishing it's root system.  I have planted my lawn 4 times and this time I used the lawn roller and the grass came up for the first time.
1.0,Broke the 1st day of use
3.0,Wasn't too thrilled reading a LEAD warning on the bottle that wasn't in the description or features that i could see. Bought it for my animals so not sure if it's even safe. The first 20 or so ounces flow great with nice mist spray but after that the last 30 or so don't come out as well. Not the best but not the worst.
5.0,"Awesome price, thick, durable plastic...with stands a few knock abouts. Works as described, if not better, a good charge up keeps pressure quite consistant and even. Adjustable nozzle."
5.0,Have a problem with the deer eating my plants and this has been the perfect sprayer to use to apply a deer repellent. Just the right size without having to pump up a tank sprayer which takes a lot more effort.
3.0,ok
1.0,The pump piston has now broken on all 3 of the sprayers. So much for everyday use. The sprayer was good and did what it is supposed to do.
1.0,"Used for bleach to clean shower.  The item stopped working after one month.  Description states it's good for chemicals, but not so much."
5.0,works great for me
5.0,great for fine mist
5.0,Works exactly as expected
5.0,"I used it to flatten out some areas where I laid down fresh top soil.  It was easy to put together, easy to fill-up, easy to drain and heavy enough to pack down the soil.  When empty, it's light enough to hang from your garage wall.  I'm 100% pleased."
5.0,"I bought this roller for regular maintenance of my Bocce Court. It was very easy to assemble and fills easily with water. The plug seems well made and hopefully won't leak water in the future. Because of the rounded edge, it does not leave marks when turning. I find it very easy to maneuver but because of its weight you must use caution near any slopes or hills."
5.0,"Nice roller for a small yard (15,000-20,000 Square Feet) if your going to push the roller. Roll after a good rain with the roller full. Nice to use after seeding to set the seeds from being blown or washed away. I would rate this roller 5 out of 5, as a push roller."
4.0,"I assembled this roller the day I received it and when I tested it, it rolled fine.  However, after two weeks of sitting, the sides bulged out.  When I then try to use it, it couldn't roll because the bulges jammed on the handle.  I then dissassembled it and added 5 washers to each side of the drums shaft, so that the handle could now clear the bulges.  Once modified, it worked fine."
5.0,"Easy to assemble, and to fill with water.  At full water capacity roller will be difficult to use without assistance from sit-on mower or small tractor.  Happy with purchase."
1.0,Roller works fine. The plug for the water fill is defective. The lever tightener does not secure the plug
4.0,"I needed to raise the lawn to meet the new sidewalk I had put in last year. Initially, I found it easy to foot stamp the new soil though it was a little time consuming. When the area I wanted to raise became to large about 200 square feet. I new I couln't foot stomp the soil, so I decided to buy a roller, the Agri-Fab Poly Push/Tow Lawn Roller #45-0267, is the one I decided to buy. I just filled with water and leveled the area I wanted to do.  Which made my job alot easier.  The roller will be easier to store when not in use and will come in handy when I do the rest of the lawn , maybe next year. Well, worth the investment!"
5.0,"This is Judy's Son, Mark, writing this review. This is a nice roller. Comes to you brand new in the box from the manufacturer. Ships promptly. No problems or hassel. Fills up with water from your garden hose. Comes with a nice tight plug! Very durable roller barrel! Some things to keep mind: this roller fills up to 240lbs. and caution is advised for anyone with health issues... consult your doctor before using this roller manually. This roller can be hooked up to your tractor, comes with a hitch. For pre-existing lawns: use roller in early spring when the ground is soft for best results... in the summertime when the ground is dry, this roller is not heavy enough... June - August it would be wise to purchase a roller that is above 600lbs. and a tractor is needed. For my yard in the summer, I have a 910lbs. Steel Tow
Roller form Agri-Fab ([...])
that I hook up to my tractor... goodbye mole holes! I use the 240lbs. roller (the one listed here) in the front of my yard... I love the option to be able to push/pull this model of roller... a great workout and great results on my front lawn! Also, this roller is good for new lawns anytime of the Spring/Summer/Fall. Rake, roll, and apply your new lawn with no puddles! If you are laying down stones, patio pavers, or even wood chips, this roller is for you! Easy to assemble and a great price to boot! I bought this roller in March and I am quite satisfied with it. I am one happy customer!"
4.0,Filled it with sand and tow it behind a gator  bigger would be better but this does a decent job
5.0,i removed the grass from my back yard and put down a thick layer of pea gravel this is great to smooth down where the dogs and grandkids play.  it is very heavy when you try to turn this around it should not be a problem if your male
5.0,This is a terrific sprayer for use bot inside and outside the home. I use mine for Febreze. Why buy a hand-pump trigger spray bottle when for just a few dollars more you can get this great product?
5.0,Many sprayer types leak if left pressurized; not this model.
5.0,It does exactly what I need but my only complaint is that it makes a very loud squeak every time the plunger is depressed.
5.0,"I used this on a wallpaper job. A dozen or so pumps, and pressure was built up enough to do an entire bedroom wall worth of wallpaper.  It has a nice, fine must. I was very happy with the quality."
5.0,SUPURB....
5.0,I like this product but I have not had it long enough to know how it will hold up. That is a huge factor with spray bottles and the type of fluid put in them.  I am happy with the ordering process.  Prompt and arrived on time.
4.0,Good sprayer nozzle tends to clog somewhat easily.
5.0,Worked great to spray essential oils around my camp to repel bugs! Pressure was perfect and lasted a LONG time. I drove cross-country with this full of liquid and it never spilled. Very happy with this product!
4.0,works fine
1.0,"Lasted about 40 days, just long enough so I can't return item. JUNK product in my eyes"
5.0,"Fast shipping, item as described."
4.0,Works great but uses a lot of spray fast
2.0,doesn't pump easily and releases out sides not front
5.0,Got to spray degreaser on engine to clean easy to move around under hood
5.0,"I'm using this to mix my own Neem oil spray.  It's lightweight and works just greas.
I was happy to find such a tool."
5.0,The wife loves it works great! Chapin 1002 48oz
1.0,I had an older one that worked for years but this new one stopped working after less than 2 months.
5.0,So far this thing has been great. I use it for small mixes of herbicides and pesticides when I don't want to mix a ton. It's ergonomic and effective.
5.0,I got this to spray a neem solution on my outdoor herbs and I'm really enjoying not having to repeatedly squeeze a trigger.  I may pick up another (maybe a different larger version though) because it's also quite handy for giving my motorcycle a quick rinse.
5.0,This sprayer works great for me to spray vinegar between the bricks on my patio to get rid of the moss that grows between the bricks.
4.0,Used to spray Neem Oil in our pollinator garden to help organically control pests - mostly aphids.  Sprayer seems to be well built and works as expected.  Much easier than the conventional sprayer like you'd find on a 409 or Windex bottle.  Need to order a couple more for other solutions.
5.0,Great little sprayer. One of the best features is that it will spray a fine mist so that if you use it indoors it don't leave puddles on the floor.
2.0,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to receive and use the sprayer.  I took it out to my apple tree, pumped it 10-20 times and went to spray only to find it sprayed for less than 2 seconds-no pressure.  I kept going around the tree with the same results keeping the pumping going more and more.  I read where it might take a drop of oil in the plunger so I tried that with no better results.  I did not over fill the base-it just is not getting any pressure with the pumps.  If any of your have suggestions, I am open."
5.0,"Great for all of your spraying needs. I've used it for weed killer, insect killer. I am going to purchase one for the application of my marinades when grilling or smoking my holiday meats. I'm even thinking about using it to apply the soap solution for tenting my auto windows. You can't go wrong with this little sprayer."
5.0,"I use it on the windows at work.  I like the quality, and its easier to use than the conventional window cleaner spray bottle."
1.0,"I used Solo sprayers in the past, but my 4 year old sprayer finally broke on me. Therefore, I decided to try the Chapin sprayer. What a big mistake, there is no locking trigger and the white plastic piece that works the nozzle is cheap and broke after just using it twice. Never again. going back to a solo sprayer."
5.0,Excellent product. A few small pumps and it sprays for a long time. Easy to use. If you have plants buy it.
5.0,works great
5.0,Love the size and how it works. Definitely a great buy.
5.0,"I love everything about it, it does a wonderful job! I will order a second one-my husband was impressed and wants one as well :-D"
2.0,I thought this looked like such a neat bird feeder I had to get it for my Grandpa. Shipping was great and it arrived super fast. When I took it out of the package I was like this is so cool looking. But upon closer examination it is very very very cheaply made. Thin plastic and the paint was not inside the lines. I am super disapointed. This would have been soooo cool if they had put a little more into it. Not worth the price.
5.0,This is a great item...especially for anyone at at cottage or lake house.  Using nyjer seed for yellow finches and chickadees..it was perfect. This item and its price make a great thank-you gift for a visit and is priced right for that occasion. I have two of them at our cottage and plan of giving two more as Christmas gifts to friends who live on waterways with lighthouses.  It holds a very good amount of seed and the seed never gets wet!  A Great Item!!
1.0,"The multi-section pole is extremely flimsy and is not capable of supporting the loaded feeder in anything other than calm weather conditions. The feeder housing is 100% light plastic. This is a classic case of ""you get what you pay for"". I find it hard to believe that it was made in America. If this unit were to be manufactured with a more solid post attachment base piece with the buyer responsible for providing the actual post the feeder would easily rate at least three stars."
4.0,"COSTMETICALLY PLEASING TO THE EYE , nice to look at . The perch is too close to the feeder causing the birds to have to sit sideways . yes , I speak for the birds as we have regular customers at our feeders . I forgot , it is also hard to fill because the opening is too small ."
5.0,"This is a high quality plactic birdfeeder that will brighten up your yard with a fun lighthouse design. It seems to be medium to high quality that should last years to come.

Update: This birdfeeder lasted only a month before the squirels found it, got to it a it fell to the ground breaking in several pieces. Maybe I should have invested in a squirel baffel then maybe it would have lasted longer."
4.0,"The birdfeeder I had for 12 years just like this one finally had to be replaced . I was so lucky to find a new one just like it .It's Great ! It holds a lot of seed , is easy to fill and slips easily onto our pole ."
2.0,"I was very disappoined in the product. It turned out to be plastic, not ceramic like I the one I had purchased in the past. I went back to the site and could not find where the seller states that the product is plastic. It does not compare to the ceramic Lighthouse Bird Feeder I currently own. The seller should identify this item as plastic and not have it a suprise to the buyer when it arrives at their home."
5.0,Handle was well made. The product was as described and fit perfect.
5.0,good product
1.0,"Seemed nice but the wooden handle broke right above the metal ferrule on the first use of turning over some dirt in raised beds nothing that this handle shouldn't be able to ""handle"". Ended up buying a complete replacement spading fork since the cost of two replacement handles is about the same.
Update: I believe the tree my handle was made from had a fungus problem. Apparently, this fungus damage is not evident on the surface of the wood only when a decent force is applied and the handle breaks will it be discovered."
4.0,Decent quality.  The Handle could be attached with a pin that goes all the way through instead of nails.  Overall though a good purchase to replace a silage fork handle.
5.0,on time...right price...excellent value
5.0,High quality.  Fit my spading fork very well.  Used to dig potatoes after installation and found the handle to be adequate for the bending stress imposed.
5.0,Works well...
5.0,This was a sturdy fork handle that is a great replacement for the worn handle I was using.
5.0,The above item has been very satisfactory. I have no complaints so far.
5.0,An old spading fork needed a new handle. The product description implied that the new handle would fit. It did!
5.0,Works VERY well and was easy to use. It seems to be pretty heavy duty which surprised me because it was one of the less expensive ones. I got this for my organic gardening and spraying BT.
5.0,Best of its kind
5.0,Works as expected.  You do need to pump it manually but it gives a good spray for the effort.  I would not purchase anything larger than quart size - water is heavy and I can't imagine lifting and spraying with a gallon sized sprayer.
4.0,Needed this instead of using a pump up sprayer for small jobs and it works great!
5.0,"I have been using this sprayer now for a few months, with all sorts of fluids (deer repellent, insect repellent, mildew control solution...) and it still works great. I previously had a larger one (2 gal.) that became unusable after filling it only 2/3 times with deer repellent solution, but this one never clogs up (provided that you rinse it after use and let it open to dry up).

I actually bought two, thinking that I might have needed a spare, but I didn't need to use the second one so far."
5.0,This is exactly what my husband wanted to replace.
3.0,Using the sprayer to apply enzymatic cleaner to a pet-stained carpet. Probably it would be better for something with less surfactant; foamy product did not dispense particularly well. On the plus side the sprayer is quite light when full though it empties rather quickly. Probably it would work fine for smaller jobs like spraying down walls or tile. For this job I'll likely get a larger sprayer....
5.0,Love works great
5.0,Love the first one I bought so much I bought another one. I use these for auto detailing and much prefer them to the usual trigger spray bottles.
4.0,Worked great. Would buy again
5.0,Works great.  I also like the adjustable nozzle...goes from stream to spray.
2.0,Broke on second use. There is a tiny plastic clip that holds the thing together. Though it sprayed nice and even the first use.
5.0,best little sprayer ever
4.0,"Great! works better than I expected, and I only have to pump it a couple times and it seems like it sprays forever before I have to re-pump it."
5.0,This is pretty good product.
5.0,What a great value to be able to buy a bunch!
1.0,Does not work properly.
4.0,quality sprayer for a good price
5.0,Great for  car care products.
2.0,Not for any chemical spraying.
5.0,love this bird feeder and the birds love it too
5.0,"I love it, as well as the squirrels!  Now I need a squirrel protector."
5.0,"I had bought one from Tractor Supply several years ago and have been looking for another at a reasonable price. It is a very sturdy bird feeder and lasts longer than any other type that I have ever purchased and I have purchased MANY! The original one is still fully functional! I keep four or more bird feeders going at a time, lots of action in our backyard!"
4.0,Birds love it but so do squrrils
1.0,Piece of junk. Don't get it.
1.0,Difficult to fill.
4.0,Really like this bird feeder. Well made and not to difficult to put together.
2.0,"Returned it, I thought it was made out of ceramic but its a cheap plastic."
3.0,"Broke right away, the base broke off of the top.  I was able to glue it together"
4.0,Love the look of this feeder but not quite as sturdy as I would like for WINDY Kansas
1.0,Did not hold pressure. Returned
1.0,"I Ordered 4, the clips where not good on them. I had to order different ones."
5.0,easy to use and durable
5.0,Works great! I was able to adjust the nozzle to deliver anything from a fine mist to a more direct spray. I've used to to apply neem oil and diatomaceous earth so far to my garden plants and it works perfectly. I'm going to purchase one for my parents!
5.0,Works very well...holds pressure for weeks
5.0,Sprays okay
5.0,Works great as a sprayer for presoaking cars with waterless wash before washing.
5.0,I use it for spraying insecticide and fungicide on my roses.
5.0,"This is perfect! I make a boric acid mixture with vinegar and penny royal eo to control roaches and other pests resulting from dirty neighbors. Spray bottles break often, become clogged, and make my hands cramp. This works great!"
5.0,"I got this to spray febreeze. The pumps the bottle comes with can get tiresome to keep spraying over a large area. So I tried this. AWESOME. Makes spraying febreeze totally easy, I get a consistent fine spray and can use the bulk refill bottles to save money. I'd recommend using this sprayer for febreeze and any other household spray cleaner"
5.0,"I use this to wash mud of the lights on my semi when I come out of the mines. Pump it up a few times and there is more than enough pressure to get the job done. Several drivers have asked me where I got it and I have referred them here.

I will be buying a couple more to keep as spares."
5.0,This sprayer produces a powerful stream that shoots a long way.  A good portable alternative to a hose.  Seems heavy duty and is of good quality.  Ergonomic.  Many uses but I mostly use it to spray off cleaner off my bicycle after rain rides.
5.0,Perfect product
5.0,This little sprayer is great. Heavy duty and well made . My 5 year old grandson spent a morning playing with it and it keeps on ticking.
5.0,"This is what I needed. Hubby has dirty clothes from work, I use a mixture of different ingridents to spray dirt and grime. I was tired of the spray bottles, took for ever. This works awesome!"
5.0,"Handy size; always at the 'ready'.  Well aimed, fine spray."
5.0,"Amazing bottle. I use them for my auto detail company. I used to by sprayers every 10 days and finally got sick of it. Now, I use these bottles for all the products that I have and never worry about buying another bottle again!"
5.0,Easy to use.  Nice spray.
5.0,"Have ordered several of these for a variety of sprays needed  for a sick palm tree. For a little thing, has great pressure and with the adjustable nozzle can shoot a stream a fair distance. Comes in handy for reaching the top of the palm!"
5.0,Works well and is easily adjustable.  Performs as I had hoped.  Good product.
1.0,This bird feeder needs support at the base or it leans. Not made well.
1.0,"Piece of garbage. Maybe worth 5 bucks.
So flimsy only tiny finches will land on it. Might last a couple months"
5.0,"After my other one of these was smashed by hail, I was glad to find it still available.  The birds seem to like it better than another style feed I have."
4.0,It is very cute and the birds love it. I recommend buying this if you want one on a pole.
5.0,Easy to assemble and it is already attracting lots of birds.  I particularly like the sliding opening on top for easily adding seed.  I bought online because I couldn't find anything like this feeder in the stores.
3.0,"I am not a fan of how you have to refill this bird feeder, through a small opening at the top (the circle piece at the top) ""opens"" when you turn it and there is a LITTLE spot you refill it in. I use a big jug to refill my feeders as they are all large and hold a lot of seed INCLUDING this one and it is a PAIN to refill as I take the entire top off to refill. Just very annoying. Works great though just a pain to refill."
1.0,"Waste of money, cheap design, couldn't put it together, parts did not match, holes didn't line up. My 8 year old daughter could have built it better."
5.0,I bought this to replace a broken one just like it that lasted for several years. This one seems to be just as well made. I did not however use the pole that came with it. I have a wooden post with a hole drilled down the center that I put this feeder on top of.
4.0,"Put together easily. A little flimsy, but for the price, it's good."
5.0,"I bought this one to replace an old that was 30yrs old. Really like it,though I did have to reinforce it with wire to the fence. Now it is stable enough for doves to use it."
2.0,"My experience has been much different after using this sprayer for a few years. Initially I bought 2, and they worked great!!  I used them for washing motorcycles and cars. So I bought more, IIRC 6 total. At this point, one still kinda works...the rest are broken for one reason or another.

The issues were varied:
- In a few, the pump failed (I.e. You could not build pressure).
- At least two others, where the ""trigger"" would no longer spray. So the bottle would be filled with soap and pressurized, but you couldn't apply it because of the trigger.
- At least one where the nozzle would no longer adjust and the liquid would basically only come out in a large volumes. The adjustable tip, would just spin..still attached but I'm assuming some plastic tab or thread broke.

To be clear, these bottles were not abused, thrown around, dropped on the concrete, etc...Heck they didn't last long enough.

They worked great when they worked, as short as that may have been."
5.0,"Durable, lasts, works well with ROH, Oils, pepper suspensions.
Holds good pressure and delivers a steady stream down to fine spray. Can not mist droplets.
 can clog with suspensions; does great with solutions and emulsions.
04/19/2018 Just bought my fourth sprayer - now I have one for each substance that I usually spray around home and garden."
5.0,"Has a wide variety of adjustment from stream to mist.
Great handy size, not too big or too small!
My buddy who goes through these things in a greenhouse says there are 2 important factors.
One is the plastic pump rod this has. Important! Metal corrodes and then eats up the seal, so it will leak. So you want the plastic.
The other  thing is to release the pressure after every use by just cracking the top open momentarily.
This saves the pressure seal and it will last YEARS longer this way!"
5.0,I really like this sprayer it works well.  Made well. At first I couldn't get pressure in the bottle but then just gave the top a bit more turn to tighten it more and that did the trick.  It has a nice seal.
5.0,"Nice design, good size, easy to hold and use. Hopefully, it holds up over time, but so far I'm quite pleased. Good Value."
5.0,This thing is amazing. I use it for my daily shower spray. I'm able to put a large amount inside to prevent from having to refill so often. I love being able to just hold the trigger down to spray my whole shower. Makes life much easier.
5.0,Save lots of money using this instead of spray cans
4.0,"It works well and has a good spray, I just wish it had a piece to wedge under the handle so you don't have to hold it down the whole time you're spraying (my other one had that)."
1.0,"1. The is no ""fine"" spray and nothing close to a mist.
2. It's got a plastic nozzle, for the same price get one with a brass metal nozzle.
3. Warning lable says it contains lead and you should wash your hands. No thank you, I'll buy one without the lead."
2.0,"While the quality seems to be good, the design is awful if you are using it for herbicide.
The problem is that if you have the sprayer pointed downward to spray weeds the pickup tube doesn't get
the liquid once the level goes down.
I'm not talking about milking the last few drops, mine stops with 16 ounces still in the bottle."
3.0,The post is not made so....in florida sand it is not securely in the ground and tends to fall over easily.
1.0,This came broken in several pieces.
3.0,"Cheap but still looks good. Doesn't stay up straight because the poles aren't that strong. Maybe if I didn't fill it all the way, it could support the feeder better. Food for thought...."
4.0,This is my second one. Love the look but the squirrels and raccoons destroyed the first one getting to the bird seed. The plastic is soft and not especially strong. If you have critter problems it makes more sense to go with something metal or tough polycarbonate construction
5.0,"I already had one, this one compliments it.  However, there were no instructions for putting in the perches.  There were also no directions for returning it, if the lighthouse was damaged.  I did love the lighthouse."
5.0,It looks very cute on my balcony.
4.0,"I love this feeder. It looks cute in my yard, the squirrels have a hard time getting to it, but that also has to do with placement in my yard, and the birds seems to enjoy it. The only things I wasn't to happy about was installation, it is still slightly loose on the top but if you tighten it anymore you are unable to swivel the lid over the opening where the seed goes in. Also, I wish there was a locking mechanism that connects the top of the ""light"" to the post in the ground. It just gets pushed onto the top during installation and is slightly wobbly. Hasn't fallen off YET but I'm anticipating it if strong winds come through."
5.0,bought this for our grandmother who loves light houses.  It is very nice quality and super cute
3.0,"It was OK but certainly not going to hold up around squirrels.  Not a fault of the bird house, I should have paid more attention to the materials."
5.0,Birds love this lighthouse! It's the first feeder of many that the birds go for.
4.0,Works well for hot water and wall paper removal
5.0,Great sprayer at a great price.
5.0,Best sprayer ever sprayed lots of horses and mules.  Van
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,"Small, yet powerful.

Great little sprayers!"
5.0,"Like it so much, I bought another one for different chemicals"
1.0,"Never even got to use it.  The product page says nothing about lead, but the sprayer has a huge lead warning (Contains Lead, Wash Hands After Using) printed on the side of it.

I have no intention of using a sprayer that contains toxic lead on my organic vegetable garden.  Would have been nice to know before I wasted my time ordering and returning it."
5.0,Really like this small sprayer for projects where I don't need a four gallons of spray.
5.0,Great for mixing up cleaning agents instead of buying expensive aerosol cans
5.0,You see so many mixed reviews about sprayers (I have a bunch for different purposes) This one works pretty great though. Easy to pump and easy to adjust the nozzle. We'll see how long it lasts.
5.0,"I was looking for a battery operated sprayer for use with bathroom cleaner.  I have arthritic hands and squeezing spray bottle to clean the shower, bathtub area was difficult and painful.  Couldn't find a battery operated sprayer and saw this so I thought I would give it a try (knowing Amazon's great return policy) and glad I did.  Just fill bottle up and pump the handle (very easy to do)  and it sprays just like it was battery operated.  The spray can be adjusted to a spray or stream.  The bottle sprayer is made of a sturdy plastic but is still light enough to hold. Can't say enough about this pump sprayer and no batteries needed.  Who knew it could be fun and easy to clean the bathtub!"
4.0,Great for cleaning out the old angry clam. A++
5.0,Great if your starting seeds!! Love it!
5.0,"Fantastic!  I have been buying the little spray bottles for years and they stop working by second use!  This is just as advertised.
Works great for spraying mold off my fence/house exterior and concrete walks.  Also for spraying fertilizer on plants.
I love it!"
5.0,works well
1.0,"A disappointment. Having read numerous review of similar items this came up a leader. Boy was I wrong. It leaks and spray doesn't adjust to a fine setting and leaks at the top, too. I'll purchase a more expensive product or just stick an squeeze sprayer and take an aspirin for the hand pain. Final analysis: Go for a $30 model and save yourself aggravation."
5.0,Big improvement over my previous pro squirt bottle. Highly recommend.
5.0,Nice
1.0,"Absolute junk!! I used it for 2 days and spray handle lever already broke, very CHEAPLY made! I never dropped it either. The lever uses a cheap small plastic clip that pulls the spray plunger so broke and fell off. Now item is useless. Also handle is very flimsy. I guess u get what u pay for. Don't waist ur money or time on this spray bottle. The only reason it gets one star is because you have to for comment to submit."
5.0,Love this sprayer!
5.0,Had one of these for almost 10 years till the elements and squirrels beat it up.  Glad to have a new one!!
1.0,"The Cherry Valley Coach Lamp Bird Feeder looks nice in the picture but in person its not as nice, and it has a really, really bad design in my opinion. The one I received was actually broken (the plastic top part of the hopper was broken, while this did not really affect the integrity or functionality of the feeder, it just proves its not very durable plastic and not likely to withstand our seasonal extremes of hot and cold here in NJ).

The Cherry Valley Coach Lamp Bird Feeder ships in multiple pieces. You have to assemble the hopper/ feeder with a long rod that screws the top and the bottom of the hopper to the feeder to keep it in place (I already trashed the feeder, so I do not know the length of the rod but I want to say it is about 10-12 inches long). I ordered a preowned one and the screw did not fit end to end, well, it did but it made the part that you twist open to put the seed in a little too snug, actually it was so snug that I could barely twist it to open it and fill it.

The stake attaches to the feeder once you are done with assembling the feeder itself. Overall it is about 6 feet in length, and the stake is not one solid stake like a Shepard hook is, its actually 4 hollow metal sections. You have to use a rubber mallet to connect each section from end to end and then place the feeder on the top of the stake. You have to sink it down into the ground at least 8"" according to the instructions so the feeder stands a little over 5 feet above ground. The stake is single pronged and not double pronged for those who are wondering.

Overall it is a nice looking feeder and looks like it would hold A LOT of seed. I am glad I purchased a preowned one, although its been thrown away since Amazon was nice enough to issue a refund for the damaged feeder, after seeing what it looks like, and learning its assembly, I can't say I wish to reorder this particular feeder. Definitely not worth $30+ in my opinion. Considering it is cheap plastic that broke in transit, I don't think this feeder would last very long due to its clear lack of durability. Plus we get a lot of squirrels who love to invade feeders, I doubt this feeder would survive their daily invasions!"
4.0,"I love the way the feeder looks.  Feeder itself is plastic, but has held up well under constant squirrel bombardment, and it was very easy to put together.  Only complaint I have is that the top of the pole got deformed when I was pounding it in to the ground, which made it difficult to attach the feeder.  But it would probably have been OK if I had used a rubber mallet.  You'll want to get a squirrel baffle, as the buggers can get right up the pole and eat you out of house and home.  We are getting a new feeder because the squirrels can just jump to it from the fence, but if you have space to put it away from their launch points, and if you get a squirrel baffle, this is a great (and cute) feeder for the money."
1.0,Cheaply made.
5.0,Good product.  Did not get deep enough into ground and blew over and broke plastic feed container.  Maybe stronger plastic would be better.
4.0,Received it on time for a Christmas present.  Looked great and just what the reciepient wanted.
5.0,very nice feeder
4.0,Works but the wind tends to blow out some seed.
5.0,I bought this for my step mom for her birthday and she loved it. She went right home and hung it up. It serves it's purpose and looks pretty hanging from the tree.
4.0,"When taking it out of the box, it seemed very flimsy, but it's been up for about three weeks and the birds flock to it, definitely squirrel proof, and may last the winter.  Snow will be the test."
1.0,Sprayer arrived without black nozzle so cannot function properly.
5.0,Good product.
5.0,Holds pressure very well. It's fun to use and works great.
5.0,works fine hope it hold up to rhe cleaning chemicals I use
5.0,Works really well
5.0,Works great as a small pressure sprayer. It saved me from throwing out 2 containers of Roundup weed killer.
1.0,Broke on second time using it.  Very cheap trigger mechanism.
5.0,"Best sprayer I have use. Very solid construction and it has astrong stream. The price is excellent, too! I use this to conserve water when dry camping for rinsing off my toothbrush, washing my hands, rinsing off dishes, and anything else that requires just a little water. With the sprayer, I use less water and am not constantly tapping into my tiny freshwater tank."
5.0,"I chose to use sprayers for my plants and for cleaning purposes in my apartment to avoid damage to my wrist nerves and to prevent the development of carpal tunnel after observing the janitorial staff utilize these. I logically thought this would be a great and fun to make cleaning a little more enjoyable. The first sprayer I purchased was good, but had a major downfall - the pump rod was made of metal, which completely rusted out (as you can see from the picture). In purchasing a new one - the Chaplin 1002 48-Ounce Multi-Purpose Sprayer - I made sure to buy one that does not have a metal pump rod. This one is made of plastic; so, I don't have to worry about it corroding and compromising the integrity of the sprayer itself. (Reference the attached picture for yourself). The sprayer has an adjustable nozzle enabling it to mist, jet, and spray. It's versatile, it's hygienic, and most imporantly won't rust!"
5.0,"I work at a Christian Church/School doing custodial/maintenance work. I've been doing this type of work for 15 years and have tried all sorts of spray bottles. Most last a few months and die. So I was looking for something that would hold a lot of cleaning chemical and last longer then the regular spray bottles and this fits the bill. It's got a wide mist setting that works really well and also a narrow that shoots abut 5ft. Costs more then a regular spray bottle but seems like it will last a long time,"
1.0,The design of this is very flimsy. The plexiglass was all broken on arrival. Poor packaging didn't help.
4.0,Bird feeder is a great addition to my garden. It is sturdy and durable. It is a good product for the price.
5.0,"Very nice feeder.  Lots of room for several birds to feed at once, and easy to fill.  I had one just like this before, that lasted for a decade."
2.0,"We ordered this feeder for our daughter for Christmas last year and when they opened it, it was missing not only the mounting pole but the center rod that holds it together. Attempts to get the replacement parts were unsuccessful and because it wasn't an expensive feeder, I let it slide. We then ordered another feeder thinking my wife and I would keep the first one and I would fix it myself. When the second one arrived at my daughter's house, the pole and center rod were in the box but the main part that holds the seeds was broken and completely unusable. I will be trying to contact the seller by phone because the website is not really setup and most links don't work. I'm very sorry I bought this feeder and won't make the mistake again."
2.0,The bird feeder did not live up to my expectations because #1 it is not squirrel proof.  Not only do the squirrels shimmy up the pole and hang upside down but they gnaw at the edges and now the whole feeder is cracked.  And #2 it is not on a sturdy enough pole so it sways and gets crooked so not sitting proper on the pole.
5.0,"I have lived 25 miles north of the actual Cape Hatteras Lighthouse  for over 20 years and have seen it often!  I have also seen MANY poor reproductions.  This is one of the best and would make an entirely suitable decoration without even having the feeder function!  But then when it is in the yard, hanging from a branch, it is great to see.  It is especially iconic if it involves a pine tree (NC state tree) ,and having a cardinal (NC state bird) feed at it!

Another plus is the size.  This is my second one.  I still have the 10 year old first one, and I repainted it to match the Bodie Island Lighthouse, which is another 30 miles north!"
5.0,I love to see my birds with room to spare on this feeder.  You can put it away from the porch or deck so they don't mess up your area.
4.0,"I like the bird feeder. It came with a corner of the plastic poking out of the box..maybe needed larger product box to protect it. Had scratches all over it, but figured it would be outside getting more scratches..and Made in China..Could use a thicker,heavier grade of pole to stop the sway from the oversized Container, but all in all..it serves it's purpose...was the least expensive and only one I found with pole included"
1.0,Had such high expectations and have never been disappointed with anything I have purchased online. The packaging was sub-par as it was broken on the bottom. Will return ASAP and hope the seller considers more careful packaging in the future.
1.0,It arrived broken and had to be returned. I couldn't really tell if it work would well mounted on a post.
5.0,Works great....
5.0,I use this to mist my citrus plants when i move them inside during the winter. When adjusted all the way down it makes a nice gentle mist.
5.0,"Could not be happier with this.  It's sturdy, clearly is going to last a long time, and saves my hand from the strain of spraying with a trigger bottle.  I am using this for pet cleaning products on the floor.  I LOVE it, and am SO happy I found this and made this purchase.  Wish I had done it sooner, and honestly, I will probably put a few more for other cleaning needs, both indoor and out!"
5.0,"I use this for washing my car (waterless wash). It works very well. I'm buying another one. This is a very nice sprayer - holds pressure well. The shape and size of the bottle are great. I use the measurements on the side of bottle all the time. I bought two Solo sprayers as well - the more rounded looking ones (one smaller and one larger than this). They're fine, but this is the one I reach for all the time. It works reliably and just feels right.

I have another sprayer that I like better (Kwazar) than this one, but it was $40. You can buy 4 of these (price as I write this) for one of those. They're great, but not 4x better.

If this one had a pressure release valve it would be the perfect pump sprayer for me. Given the price it seems like a steal. One more kind of silly feature, like to hang my sprayers from the handle, even when full. This one hangs from the handle nicely. The Solos tend to roll around and can fall off. This one stays put.

Just a great little sprayer. Chapin, please considering adding a pressure relief valve. Also, would be great to have a smaller version of this one."
5.0,Solved my bug problems in the garden
3.0,It's ok. Good size to hold but Liquid leaks from the cap.
5.0,Seems to work well.
5.0,The quality of this product was great. It works perfectly and I plan on purchasing additional ones.
5.0,I use these every day for my work and love then. These are the only brand sprayers that last for me.
5.0,"I bought two of these for bugs/pest spray and lawn spot treatment, outstanding sprayers."
5.0,This feeder holds a lot of bird food! Very easy to put food in. It does work nicely and appealing to look at.
5.0,"My mother loves lighthouses, and watching birds.  This is the best of both worlds for her.  She hasn't complained about it so I give it 5 stars since it made me the worlds best son on Christmas for being so thoughtful for finding a product that covered two of her favorite things."
3.0,"Made of plastic - don't expect porcelan.  Holes for feed are rather large and more seed pours out than my other feeders leaving lots for squirrels.  I don't expect it to last too long, but does look good with other nautical style feeders I have."
5.0,I love it but the squirrels ate half of the rim the birds stand on.  I am sure the other half will be gone when I get home today. The squirrels tear up everything.
5.0,"bought this as a gift and he loved it, if you love birds and lighthouses then this is def for you"
4.0,"Purchased two of these feeders.  Holds alot of seeds. The reason I purchased it was because it is plastic and it looks nice.  We live in PA and we get some bad winter weather and gusty winds and did not want to buy a wood one that would eventually rot from the elements.  The only draw back is that there are holes in the plastic where the three perches go for the birds to stand on, they were too small and my husband had to drill larger holes, which was not a big deal at all.
I believe you will be pleased should you order this birdfeeder.  :)"
4.0,I really like them. i ordered two of them I would highly recommend them. They are really pretty and serve their purpose.
4.0,"I've read many reviews which stated the hanging wire came loose, the feeder crashed to the ground and the unit broke. People, you must open the feeder to fill it with seed. The wire is in PLAIN SIGHT and it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know at a glance that the wire MUST be secured by the owner before it will do what it is designed to do. I've had mine since late yesterday afternoon, filled it with 10 pounds of seed, hung it last night and the birds are flocking to it this morning. If It is installed correctly, it will perform as advertised. My wife and I are extremely pleased with our purchase. Look forward to many, many hours of enjoying the birds, our feeder and the fact that it holds enough seeds to last about a week before refilling is necessary!
Remember, it must be installed correctly as most everything you use must be!"
5.0,"I love this bird feeder.  It is easy to open and fill.  I had one that I bought years ago and it finally broke.  I had looked for another one just like it some time ago and was unable to find it.  I recently just stumbled upon this one when searching for something else on Amazon.

I have it set up and the birds are back and happy."
1.0,"I just recently found out the the bird feeder I purchased for a friend's Christman, along with the bird food was damaged. I was very disappointed."
5.0,"Good, but watch the fluids you use.  some are harsh on plastic."
5.0,"Great little pumper, good capacity, nice even spray distribution, highly recommended."
5.0,So much better than conventional spay bottles.
5.0,"Great tool for the job. My wife spent hours with toothbrush and cotton buds trying to clean the crud out of the lower corners and crevices of the PVC window frames in our house. Then I saw this. Some hot water, a little detergent and you have a hand held pressure washer. Blasted the crud out in seconds. Job completed and wife very happy!"
5.0,This works well and is easy to prep - a BIG plus with my arthritic hands.
3.0,Really loved this spray bottle I really enjoy owning one made my work easy the only thing is I don't think you could use everyday cuz mine's already broke and that has me very disappointed but I'm going to buy a bunch of them.
5.0,"I love these sprayers.  I have used these for over a year now and not one has clogged up or failed on me yet. I do make sure to clean them out with hot soapy water if I use pesticide or herbicide since they tend to leave a greasy film. In an attempt to repel deer in my garden, I used a raw egg concoction and the sprayer handled it ok.  The concoction had marginal success with the deer which is better than anything else I've tried (I used a Ninja food processer to mix one egg with 3 cups of warm water, then strained the mixture into a sprayer.  I would have added pepper but I've tried pepper solutions before with no success)"
5.0,Great little sprayer for small jobs. They been making this type for years. A proven winner.
5.0,Great spray bottle.
5.0,"The more I use it the more I love it. I enjoy watering plants more because of it. Well designed, made with high quality plastic, it's easy to operate. I just have to remember to lubricate it with oil occasionally. It works well to spray off bugs from plants, the one of its many uses."
1.0,Came broke nothing pisses me off more than when something you order comes broke.
5.0,Perfect for my orchids. Going to buy another real soon
5.0,Sometimes low tech is the best answer. I own several electric(battery) sprayers and they all eventually quit. I believe the pump mechanism clogs and fails. I decided to buy this sprayer and it was the answer. It is very well built and really does the job. Once properly chareged(about 10 pumps) the until last along time and has a very long reach spray pattern. A great bargain for a very low cost.
5.0,Does as described.
5.0,Fantastic. Does the spray job very well. Phil
5.0,"I've been using this with a dish soap / neem oil mixture and it works perfectly. The pressure is great on this, and it holds more than enough fluid for my purposes. The top plastic/plunger does feel a little delicate, but as long as you're not slamming down the plunger with each pump, I'm sure you won't run into any issues. I've had zero issues with clogging, and very consistent pressure throughout my usage."
5.0,It works great!
5.0,I really like this sprayer. It is perfect for what I'm going to use it for.
5.0,Good sprayer great for household uses.
5.0,This is perfect for my BBQ sprayer. Nice and solid. Love it
5.0,Using it for my reptile. Solid water spray bottle.
5.0,"This small pump sprayer is extremely handy for all sorts of products. I have used this with purple power, simple green, bleach and water, and some weed killer. If you use bleach and water, it is best to drain the sprayer after use and flush with water as the bleach will dissolve the seals....Love this sprayer!"
1.0,Very fragile if dropped.
4.0,Good ppeer for a handheld  sprayer
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,"I really like this sprayer.  It is REALLY well made, and works really well.

I use it for a neem oil spray to treat my indoor plants when they get spider mites, as they seem to every spring.  Anyone who has used neem before knows that it's extremely sensitive to temperature changes, doesn't mix readily with water (the key is adding a gentle surfactant--a sudsing agent--I use either baby shampoo or castile soap), and easily separates.  This can make it really tricky for any sprayer, because, if it sits too long, the neem will basically separate from the water and get into the parts of the spray mechanism and render the spray bottle inoperable.  So you really need to have a sturdy, well-made sprayer.

And this is it!  It's easy to operate, great quality, and the perfect size for carrying around the house or even garden.  And, unlike the large gallon-size sprayer, it doesn't take up much space.  I love it. I think I'm going to get a few more for other uses around the house."
5.0,"Good, sprays well"
5.0,"This sprayer is so easy to use. I paid out a lot of money for the bigger ones that have the hose sprayer attached. Had nothing but problems. With this little sprayer you just fill it , pump the thingy at the top, and press down on the triigger. No problems, have already used several times and love it!"
5.0,"Handy, solid little sprayer."
5.0,Very nice little sprayer!
5.0,"Really nice, rugged construction. Working great for my reptiles."
5.0,This is a great pressurized sprayer for use in my aided gsrden. I use my 1 gallon sprayer for herbacides and am unable to use it for antifungal and pesticides. This is a great 2nd sprayer.
5.0,I use this product to water plants and to spray my chameleon 3 times a day. It gives me a fine mist and has been airtight since i bought it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable misting/spraying system for their garden or pets.
5.0,"Sprayer works great, seals well and pumps up nicely. Very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,Exactly what we needed.  Fast delivery; well wrapped.  Thanks - highly recommend
5.0,"I got this to spray my shower down with cleaning solution.  It worked great initially.  However, after I let the solution sit in the bottle for a week and I went back to use the sprayer, it was broken.  The solution was black actually.  I believe the bleach-based cleanser that I had used in this sprayer somehow destroyed the bottle's mechanism(s) and must have dissolved part of it into the solution.  I am not going to knock the sprayer at all because it was absolutely great when I first used it.  However, follow instructions and only use it for approved products.  Bleach-based cleansers will destroy this sprayer!"
5.0,"works great.  based on negative reviews about handle breaking, i take that into account and am just aware of how i am spraying"
5.0,"Item as described, arrived quickly, no issues"
5.0,Makes thing alot easier
5.0,"I like the size and uses you can use this four. I bought 3 of them so I do not have to change contents. I really like it for cleaning a/c equipment and cleaning with vinegar, especially bathroom."
5.0,"This sprayer is great! So much easier on the hand than finger pump sprayers. I had s slight leak when first pressurized - took the nozzle off and wrapped the threads with teflon tape, and I haven't seen a drop since! Highly recommend it!"
5.0,"Super simple to use, works flawlessly, much cheaper than what I have locally."
5.0,"easy to use, works well"
5.0,"Light, very portable, and sprays anything I put in it, used for all kinds of cleaning products."
5.0,"I have yet to have a single problem with this mister. I use it every single day a couple of time and day to most my sprouts, works great."
5.0,"I use this to clean my shower. I put shower cleaning solution in it, pump it up, then spray down my shower.  It shoots a fine mist which reduces wasted product, and it saved me from hand cramps from using a squeeze spray bottle."
3.0,have purchased these sprayers locally and they were great. I have used 3 of these so far and one is not holding pressure very well. It may be operator error and will continue to check it out.
5.0,I use this sprayer for bleach and wheel cleaner. It works flawlessly where as other sprayers I have used fell apart in the first week.
5.0,"This is the most convenient tool in my gardening supplies.  In one sprayer I can mix enough 24-D to treat my entire lawn, or enough Round-up (glyphosate) and 24-D to treat every other undesirable plant in my yard.  The  typical pump-up gallon-size sprayers are difficult to open and bulky. Spraying with a wand is inaccurate. Consequently, spraying gets delayed due to inconvenience. The nozzles on these Chapin 48 oz sprayers are so accurate and easy to aim that I can spray weeds and grass in and around desirable plants, like raspberries, and never damage the desirable plants.  Pulling weeds is just another name for spreading weeds.  A few weeks with one of these sprayers and my yard is reputably the cleanest in the neighborhood. I seldom take more than 20 minutes a week for a few weeks to keep my yard weed free.  A few tips:  Spray dandelions late into the fall.  Fall spraying kills the roots.  Spring spraying kills the tops.  If using qlyphosate  (Roundup), use the right amount of round up for the 48 oz.  sprayer and combine the right amount of 24-D for 48 oz. in the same sprayer. I love these so much I give them away for house-warming gifts."
5.0,Sprays evenly. Works awesome!
5.0,Great price! Works as it should...
5.0,replaced all of my trigger sprayers with these they are great but do not like solvents like mineral spirits (i didn't really think they would but i had to try) windex armor all and degreasers much better in these.
5.0,"Great sprayer for use arpund the house, particularly useful for Bonzai tree spraying"
5.0,Works perfectly and exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommended!
5.0,I love this sprayer!
5.0,"Great product.

I bough my first one for detail my car.  I make my own detailing spray using 4 oz rubbing alcohol, a few drops of dish washing liquid, a touch of  Jet Dry and enough water to make a quart.  I had used conventional spray bottles but my hand tires out in a hurry. The Chpin bottle allows me to give it a few pumps and then spray down the entire car as needed.  The spray is adustable from spray to stream.

I liked it so much, I bought a second one for spraying shower spray.  Another application that required more pumping that I liked with a conventional bottle.  I use store bought spray for this one.

The only problem I had was adjusting the spray on the second bottle.  At first I though I had gotten a defective bottle but later found that the top was not secured right.  It was hard to tell from looking at it.  It now works well.

I have been thinking about buying a third bottle for use in the garden.  I have spraying that just doesn't require the use of my larger garden sprayer..

I would recommend this product for anyone who has a lot of light spraying."
5.0,Does the job well.
3.0,great
4.0,The handle broke on my 6 year old chapin.  The sprayer/pump top on this replacement fit fine on my old bottle so now I can change off as needed.  I keep soap water in one and plain water in the other.  I use in our attached greenhouse daily. I recommend you keep it out of direct sunlight however.
4.0,Handy size when the two gallon tank is overkill.
3.0,not as nice a unit as I thought it would be. But now that I figured it out it works just fine. Fill the container to full of liquid not giving enough airspace to develop good pressure it will leak and when you reach for it it won't have any pressure. Very annoying! But once the liquid level got down far enough and I was able to build up some good pressure with a moderate volume of air it worked just fine and holds his pressure just fine. I purchased this one because I couldn't find the one that I'm used to having in my life. I used it for herbicide and now can't use it for general misting and watering.
5.0,"Nice.  Find this much easier to use than the big gallon sprayers.  Use it for in-house and outside spraying.  One container full generally gets the entire perimeter.  Oh, re: pump suction...I put a few drops of 3:1 Oil down shaft and pumps right up.  Nice, small, functional.  What more can I say?"
5.0,Great lil' pump use to spray my plants with neem oil. It holds  a good amount of liquid and there are no leaks and it's super easy to use and change spraying radius.
5.0,So far so good. Will modify if I have a problem with it.
5.0,"I have used this style for years and they are truly great. I love that you can regrease the pump casing when you need to. Has the best adjustable nozzle of any sprayer I have had, so much so that I cut one off and used it on a large gallon tank sprayer I had that had a poor nozzle. For small jobs like spraying house plants or applying foliar feed to planter boxes this is a must have."
5.0,This product was made very well it's very durable pumps and sprays really good five stars !!!!!!!!!!
5.0,Sprayer works as advertised.  I had some weed killer in a gallon jug with a sprayer that quit working.  I'd been looking at the big gallon size sprayers when I saw this.  I had no problem with the seal as others reported.  I took more pumping up than I anticipated but after a bit it produced a solid strong stream.  Worked great on the ivy covered wall behind my house I don't want the ivy to grow on.
2.0,We buy a ton of these... every time the tips break off long before the sprayer is bad... they don't sell the tips
5.0,"Excellent product and price. After pumping it several times the pressure holds for a surprising amount of spray time. The handle can feel slightly flimsy if you try to screw on the bottom by holding it, but otherwise solid so not a big deal. It doesn't produce quite a fine mist as I hoped it would, but not a deal breaker."
5.0,"I have had a Chapin 1002 sprayer for 3 years now and it is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST HAND PUMP SRAYER OF ITS SIZE that I have ever used. Just bought another. 1) Inexpensive; 2) Excellent seals. Holds pressure for WEEKS. I use mine primarily with just water. I can't speak to effect of added chemicals; 3) Efficient hand pump. I've tried others and this one is best -- all little hand pumps require effort so ignore those complaints; 4) Spray adjusts from very fine mist -- great cool mister on hot day -- to a long shot stream. I squirt my dog to stop barking -- now he's quieter if I just leave it in sight!
This is a classic, well designed product."
4.0,Works really well for a while then eventually the spray nozzle clogs/wears out after a month or two using our glue solution
5.0,Originally bought this type sprayer at ACE.  They work very well.
5.0,Great for a quick spraying of weeds.  I now use this more than the larger tank sprayers.
4.0,Seems to work well but will have to use it for a longer period to determine whether the pump continues to work.
5.0,"After reading the reviews I decided to buy one, while waiting for it to arrive I bought one at Walmart. Wht a piece of junk !! So I'm thinking this one was going to be just another piece of junk. Boy was I wrong !! This sprayer is awesome, don't let the bad reviews keep you from buying this. I don't write alot of reviews unless I buy something as awesome as this product. You will love it !!"
3.0,Works ok
5.0,Great sprayer -- especially at this price point.  I won't hesitate to buy another when necessary.
4.0,I've used these for several years. Good build quality.
5.0,"We've used these for years.  Excellent adjustability in nozzle, good distance, clean stream, and long-lived.  Usually buy in pairs for alternate types of weed sprays.  Much easier to carry than a backpack or gallon pump spray."
5.0,Awesome product for the gardeners among us
1.0,"Not worth a plug nickel, even with proper cleaning and maintenance.  You'll wear out your palm pumping it up, it sprays for a few seconds & then you have to pump it up again.  You'll spend much more time pumping than spraying, and eventually get so frustrated that you screw off the cap and just pour Roundup on the weeds.  One of those products that should be labelled: ""WARNING -- NOT INTENDED FOR ACTUAL USE""."
5.0,Well constructed and easy to work. I pressurized the item with the initial fill up and weeks (months!) the pressure is still there allowing me to mist my plants with a quick and easy squeeze of the trigger.
5.0,Works well.
5.0,This sprayer does exactly what I needed it to do.  Provides great coverage when spraying plants in the garden.  It is easy to use.
5.0,Sweet little unit! Bought for specific project. Cleaning mold and stains off outside of house gutters.  Loaded this up with Spray Nine and could shoot stream to gutter about 15 feet away. Handled cleaner well. I can see many other uses for this little guy. I am so done with cheap spray bottles.no
4.0,Convenient.
5.0,"Easy to use and sturdy, I have two on their second year.  Easy to adjust spray."
5.0,Works well.
5.0,"Very sturdy little sprayer for the price.  Well made and work very well.  I use it to spray my plants with ""Deer Out"" and the spray is very fine and consistent."
5.0,"So far I like this little sprayer.  I have been using it to spray a neem oil/soap mix on aphids and other pest that are invading my garden.  I read in the reviews some people have had the handle break off if you screw it closed by the handle so I have not done so.  But I can see how it can happen.  The handle is NOT strong enough to use to close the sprayer, only to hold it when you spray.  Other then that I am very happy with this product.  Works great and was a good value."
5.0,Replacement for the one that fell of the table.  this is the best hand sprayer
5.0,Purchased this to use with nuno felting and can't say enough good things about it.  Delivers a steady stream of fine mist that is perfect for wetting wool fibers with dislodging them.
5.0,worked great
5.0,"Exactly as described, arrived early and works perfectly"
5.0,As described and quick shipping
5.0,"Super fine mist.  Solid reservoir,  but the  spray tip is out there and susceptible to snapping off if it falls over.  In spite of this it's a super value."
5.0,This sprayer work very good.
5.0,the handiest thing we have have in a shop. we use them for many things. i don't think i would use them for solvent based products but that is the only thing we have not used in them. anything water based
5.0,works good
5.0,"If you grow orchids, this is the only way to go for misting them.  My husband used my last one for some cement work, so after many years, I've got a new one.  They seem to last forever if you just use them for water.  Sure beats having to hand pump.  My orchids love it."
3.0,"The first one received didn't have a wand. The second one's tube was too short. So, I assembled a complete one out of the two and sent the remainder back to Amazon. Amazon was great with the return and replacement!!"
4.0,"Bought this 20"" blade and the SN-9 handle (1.5"" aluminum handle) to clean rough weeds along my fence line. The blade is very sturdy and was not phased even by the thicker and tougher blackberry bushes or thick cogongrass. The blade was razor sharp out of the box and ready to work. I keep it sharp with a sharpening stone I take with me on the job. Blade is holding the edge better than other scythes I used in my earlier days (1970s, 1980s). This is an excellent tool and it runs circles around the weed eater I have that broke and didn't want to start anymore after a day of work cleaning the same fence line. The handle, SN-9, is a 1.5"" aluminum pipe bent to shape with two adjustable handles. The handles must be readjusted as they are not in the right place and angle for the way that I am accustomed to use this tool. These wood handles are too tight out of the box and required a channel lock pliers to get them loose. Also note that the screw that hold the handles in place is a left-hand thread. It has to be turned clock wise to open. Keep it hand-tight after that so you don't have to re-apply the pliers to the wood handle, it doesn't do it any good. The one star deduction of the rate is for the handles that could be done better. Otherwise this tool is a super!"
4.0,Excellent stays sharp
4.0,Works just as advertised.  [...]
2.0,Skims over grass and Weeds alike. Does not cut. Going to get a custom blade in the spring.
5.0,working as it is supposed too just need to get my rythme down
5.0,"Took a few minutes to figure out how to attach the blade. No instructions came with the blade. Extremely good quality, heavy and will give years of service. Very sharp out of the box."
5.0,"I use this blade to cut young Sumac and it absolutely slays it. It maintains it's sharpness extremely well and touches up nicely with a few strokes of a stone. I also use this blade to mow grass, but can only do this effectively when it is wet. Nevertheless, this is a brush blade, keep this blade sharp and it does the job very well."
4.0,Cuts great.
5.0,"Good blade for mixed vegetation, do you research and make sure you get the rest of the items required when buying something like this. In the end this was the most economical way to cut back the TALL grass on my property."
4.0,Going back in time and doing things around the house in the quiet mode(LOL)I think it is a great product that serves and dose the job what it supposed too. Great Quality but expensive considering the limited functionality.
4.0,Item arrived on time would recommend.
5.0,We built an outdoor shower ourselves (we live by the beach).  We have one hose for cold water and this hose we purchased for hot water.  Works perfectly and for the winter we'll unhook the hoses.  Very pleased!
4.0,"I bought this hose under the impression that it was lead free.  It is labeled ""Not labeled for sale in California"" so it probably contains lead.  The ACE branded version does not and seems to be of equal quality.  There appear to be few options for lead-free hoses; ""Boat and Camper"" lower quality hoses and some hot water ones.

This hose has great flexability but does not kink often and appears to be very sturdy (only years of use will tell for certain).

This product is made in the USA as is the ACE hose mentioned above."
5.0,Great!
5.0,Completely to expectations.
5.0,good
5.0,"Seems like a reasonably good quality blade. Like what I expected from the description. I realize longer thinner blades on European snaths are more elegant and faster for grass, but I have heavy brush to clear on a rocky hillside. This shorter thicker brush blade on the Seymour aluminum snath is working pretty good. I'm cutting through brambles, small saplings, vines, and big weeds, better than any tool I've tried. I've tried clearing in this area with several different kinds of machetes, also purchased and tried a ditch blade (sling blade), 30cc trimmer (with brush blades and every different type of line and brush attachments I could find), and a big 190cc wheeled string trimmer with the heaviest line I can buy -- the scythe brush blade on the aluminum snath is hard work, but it is my favorite so far."
5.0,This piece is needed to use the first tool. They must go together to create this wonderful tool.
5.0,"Great Product, Fast Delivery"
5.0,"This scythe blade fits perfectly on the aluminum Seymour scythe that you can buy on Amazon for about 40 bucks. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002NCFV/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0) I've used this scythe, fitted with this blade, for two years now and think it's great. Here are 5 things to consider when buying this blade:

1. You need a sharpener. I use this one, and it's great: http://www.amazon.com/Ali-Ind-6055-Scythe-Stone/dp/B000BQNXQ6/ref=pd_bxgy_lg_img_y Now, this has nothing to do with the blade quality itself. Working a scythe simply means taking a break once in a while to run your stone over the blade. Sharpening is easy, and you'll appreciate the break!
2. Working a scythe is hard work. I've found that an hour a day is more than I can do, so keeping track of a couple of acres means scything a few times a week.
3. Note that this is a Brush blade, meaning that it's a good all-purpose blade. You can get a much longer, thinner grass blade is you're just doing grass. You'll find the grass blade makes much quicker work of hay and wheat and grasses.
4. A note of caution: if you're using the aluminum handle, you need to stay away from power lines and extension cords. Traditional scythes have wood handles, keeping you safe from electric shock. The aluminum scythe can be a deadly conductor of electricity.
5. When installing this blade, you should have a couple of options in terms of the cutting angle. Play around with what works for you, as the ergonomics of scything are pretty personal."
5.0,"no problems.
works fine."
5.0,Good quality blade that holds its edge well.
5.0,It arrived already sharpened!
4.0,"This blade cuts tall weeds and light brush really well.  I would recommend that the purchaser become familiar with basic sharpening technique with a whet stone.  Videos are readily available on YouTube.  I use a very basic one from the local hardware store, and am very pleased with the results.

  The one minor complaint that I have, is that it does not cut the grass that is among the weeds and brush.  I realize that is not the purpose for which the blade is designed, so I also have a grass blade.

  All in all, I have found that using a scythe is great exercise, and makes cutting weeds and brush enjoyable."
5.0,Great product
5.0,"Blade arrives decently sharp, but get a stone anyway because it will begin to dull as soon as you start using it.  no mounting instructions with either the blade or the snath, so this is going to be a trial and error practice."
5.0,"Exactly as described. On the steel- clad wood snath, this beauty hacked its way through 1/2 inch mesquite and acacia,  as well as making short work of green tumbleweeds and all other weeds and grasses that I went after it with. Holds an edge well? But does require an initial honing as another review stated. It was sharp but with a slight lip,  easily straightened with a flat honing steel or honing rod. Takes abuse well and works GREAT. Arrived quickly and has not disappointed me."
3.0,"Was very happy to see my package to arrive, in a plastic bag, upon trying to open, my hand slipped down the blade and cutting my middle finger and palm. Ending up 4 stitches in finger and a trip to  E.R. A warning on bag would be nice, stating blade is unprotected. There needs to be some kind protective cover over blade edge. The trip to the E.R. cost me a lot more than the blade and handle cost. Please be careful upon opening  package. The product is made well and yes vary vary sharp"
4.0,Clears heavy weeds easy - will need to get a grass blade for thinner plants though.  I'm using this with the steel clad snatch I got from amazon - assembly was easy.
5.0,"Took the stones and a polishing file to it. Serious cutting power, single strokes to nipe a couple of small trees. Nuff said!"
3.0,"The item works fine but definitely need sharpening out of the box... I'm use to a longer and skinnier version of this tool.  My German blade was lighter and easier to use, but was stolen so I replaced it with this one.... will have to get use to the extra weight... the material it is made of is excellent and seems to hold an edge..."
5.0,"I had a blade that seemed heavy but that broke where the ""neck"" joins the blade.  Now, comparing this blade to that one, I can see how much better this one is made.  It hones easily and cuts beautifully.  Not the perfect grass blade but not made as such and still, when sharp, will do nicely with grass as well as weeds and brush.  I'm liking it a bunch."
4.0,"You will need to sharpen before using. Use a file Not a grinder keep from heating the blade to remove double bevel (its a holdover from the 50's so they could say its pre-sharpened) file just the top remove bur from bottom and finish with wet synthetic stone. Use Anglo style sweep ""NOT"" east European arching movements. This was designed to be used in non tilled open fields and 2nd year grass and weeds the European is for well manicured planted grain and grass it will chip and fail under most rough field and yard (rocks will knock big chunks out of them) this American style is very tough and yes a bit heaver 3 to 5 oz depending on blade compared to. The real trick is to stone it every time you stop for water. You'll notice that the longer you use it the better your blade will cut. Just use the style for stoning that you lay the snath on the ground and hold the tip of your blade stone to the snath use your foot on the neck of the snath to stabilize it.
 Also Never cut grass grain or weeds with no shoes or in sandles like on You tube vids endless your a euro fan that is. Oh yea the girl is is the exception she is pretty wild swinging hers in the air on a tractor while the blade on fire. Some lessons not to do to get cred in the USA. But she sure can cut grass. This brush blade Not a grass blade but will work on grass in small areas it will lop saplings as large as your thumb and make short work of black berry vines, thistle and other hard to cut patch grass if you keep it sharp. The grass blade 30inch resharpened and honed use the inner snath hole of the three to adjust the blade out slightly it not the euro ark its the Anglo sweep that's best for these blades. Also I should point out there is a small strap you can make and install in the inner corner to keep grass from catching in the crook of the scythe blade see older photos and you would think its a brace but its not its to keep the blade from snagging on bent stalks as you reach full ark on the the completion stroke."
5.0,Very good product
5.0,good product ''not a single leak or hole in the hose'' compared to other brand hoses I have bought
2.0,Hose itself seems okay however the black reinforcement at the faucet end is ridiculously thin (was starting to split) and not worth including Time will tell on the hose itself!
5.0,No kinks.
5.0,"These are the only kind of hoses I buy, real 100% rubber hoses. I've been buying the Craftsman brand for years, and now they are made very cheaply from China. They don't smell like rubber, but smell like a cheap vinyl hose like you can by very cheaply at Walmart. They aren't flexible like real rubber hoses are. But these Apex real 100% rubber hoses are great, flexible in cold weather, last forever. I gave my mother the first one I ever bought over 25 years ago, and it's still in good shape and flexible, no cracks."
5.0,worked great and was just the right size for my garage
5.0,Great Hose! Tired of the junk hoses on the market today.
5.0,"Nice.  It does kink in one spot occasionally, but I like it."
5.0,Needed a hose to run hot water to clean things. This is perfect. Does the job!!
5.0,Great hoses! Not too heavy even though it's clearly sturdy and doesn't stay kinked.
5.0,Have had to hose for about a year now.  I feel I made the right choice.
5.0,Excellent will purchase again
3.0,Nice hose but the brass ends don't turn so a bit of a pain too.
5.0,Very sturdy!
5.0,Use in a commercial Truck Wash. Excellent!
5.0,"Only bought a 25 foot one, so now I need another 25 feet. I've learned that with hoses it is best to buy top of the line. Cheap ones are only cheap in price."
5.0,Great hose.
5.0,great
5.0,GREAT
1.0,"The hose itself appears to be very high quality. The rubber is every bit as high quality as the Goodyear hose I have already (for much less). I have to point out that one end of this new hose leaked at the connector. I have several replacement connectors in my garden kit, so I chose to cut it off and attach a new one rather than deal with returning it and waiting for a replacement. Although the quality of the rubber is spot on, I cannot recommend this product due to its connector defect."
5.0,"I purchased this to build two counterflow wort chillers for home beer brewing, 25' each.  The hose works perfectly for this purpose, as the rubber material is rated for hot fluids and handles the boiling wort just fine. I also had no trouble feeding 1/2"" copper tubing through the length of the hose."
4.0,great deal but a bit wimpy
1.0,"I've bought dozens of hoses over the years, but never hooked up a new one to find not 1 but 2 leaks. Do NOT buy this product!!!"
5.0,Longest lasting hose you can buy. I have another I bought almost 20 years ago and still perfect and I abuse them alot.
5.0,As far as I can tell I's quality material. I'm using it to drain a boiler 170-200 degree water. Very satisfied.
5.0,good
5.0,"Works well, quality is good."
5.0,"After melting several hoses with hot water, I finally got a commercial rubber hose.  Works great.  Heavy duty.  Only downfall is it tangles more than some hoses...but that's typical with all rubber hoses."
5.0,Using this hose to drain my boiler.
5.0,I did a lot of research on hot water hoses before I bought this for use in the basement to fill my washing machine...since all these new government regulated washing machines refuse to give you truly hot water for washing. It does not leak where it is attached to the bathroom sink nor does it kink.  I am absolutely pleased with this excellent product.  I have also found ways to trick my topload washing machine into filling up with a lot more water instead of the washing machine deciding it only needs a few quarts of water to wash my clothes.  This girl is pretty proud of herself!
1.0,"What's the saying?  Fool me once...

Well, shame on me. I bought a single zone Raindrip last year, but figured it failed because I didn't screw the cover on tight enough.  Apparently not.  I bought a two zone which lasted about six days still I shut it off to do some yardwork.  Upon trying to turn it back on it would:

Turn on whenever the reset setting was on, turn on zone 2 when trying to set zone 1 (Zone two's knobs having NEVER been turned even one click), Run in the OFF position, Turn off in the ON position.  And basically fail in each and every way imaginable.  Well OK, not every way, the seal worked pretty well so at least I never had problems with it leaking from the spigot.

Raindrip = Fresno's biggest shame - and that's saying A LOT!"
1.0,"This thing died during the first season I bought it, with the valve stuck open.  Replacing the batteries didn't help - it just continuously ran the motor trying to close the valve.  Stay away."
1.0,"Have had 4 different timers and this Rain  Drip Dual Station is the worst ever..Worked 2 weeks and must have internal short (water leaking?) as batteries go dead in a day. Threaded coupling for hoses is not deep enough and some hoses pop out. Unbelievably, battery compartment isn't sealed and leaks water in.  Based on what I have seen and the other reviews here it would be a mistake to buy any Rain Drip product as their standards for product quality seem very low."
1.0,"This product is not worth buying.  I purchased one and it stopped working within weeks of bying it.  After contacting the supplier they sent a second unit.  It worked for a while and one zone failed in the open mode.  I'm not sure how long the water was on before I discovered it was permanently on.

Don't buy this.  The other reviews are right...it's junk!"
1.0,"I agree with the other reviewers. I had two of these. The battery compartment is on the top of the device--ridiculous design allowing water to penetrate to the battery! Within a short space drips off the faucet had it out of commission. I took it back to the store and got another, tied a plastic bag on the top this time. After a few days the device stopped working and began leaking water from inside. I took the cover off and found the inside to be completely flooded and all parts rusted and corroded. I was very disappointed in what could have been a very handy device. I really liked the dual station feature."
1.0,"Returning my 2nd R682CP in the past two weeks as the Zone 2 shut off does not work. The first one turned on when it should have been turned off, this one the Zone 2 does not shut off completely resulting in water waste. Two strikes and you're out for me!!!"
1.0,"I purchased this timer less than 2 years ago and I am already shopping for a replacement. I do not know what part of the mechanism broke. I do know however that the battery compartment constantly let water in, including when I tried to insulate it with additional layer of silicone. This would kill the 9v battery and the device would go out of commission. I would only notice when the plants started to look half-dead. Overall, it is a garbage product. If I could, I would replace it with another product."
1.0,"I have bought both the Raindrip dual-station and the single-station timers, and all have quickly failed.  Inside, a motor-driven gear assembly opens and closes the water valve, and the gear shafts break.  So, it becomes a throw-away!  My collection lies in a heap in my garden shed.  I'm going to send them all back to Raindrip!  And please do not confuse this RAINDRIP product name from another, called RAINBIRD, which is a completely different company."
1.0,"Another rainbird product that failed quickly. The rainbird timers (possibly those from Home Depot), including this one, work for about 1 to 2 weeks. They fill with water and shortcircuit the electronics. Once the units are opened and dried they perform only until they again fill with water. The seals appear to be intact yet they still leak. This timer only worked tempoarily on the first timer stage but not the second. The timer on the second never worked and only allowed the valve to remain ""on"". I attempted to contact rainbird, but have not at this time received a return call."
5.0,Works just as described!
5.0,"This is by far the best hose Ive ever owned. Mine is 50 feet.  We ended up buying 4 different hoses the year we bought our house (one hose for each side of the house, so we don't need to move them around.) Ive had to replace all the other brands years ago.  I use this hose daily to water my plants in the backyard.  Its been sitting directly in the sun for 7 years.  I have never had a problem with it.  Ive tried contractor quality hoses and heavy duty hoses that last 3 years at most before leaking or cracking. In the future this will be the only hose I buy.  FYI: I live in a very hot area, so Ive never used it in freezing weather."
5.0,very good
3.0,"Hose is a bit unwieldy but strong and should last. The connectors are not brass and of poor quality. I would have returned for another choice but missed the return window. I ordered heavy duty solid brass male and female fittings and replaced the poor factory provided fittings along with stainless steel hose clamps.  Now I have a decent hose that will last, although it cost me time and additional money to make it right."
5.0,"Great hose, flexible and pretty much kink free."
5.0,Works great.
4.0,good hose nice quality
5.0,"I needed a hose for a partially buried, always pressurized hose. Working fine."
5.0,"Quality, heavy duty hose"
4.0,"Great quality, it does kink easily."
2.0,This is extremely hard to separate and is not very well constructed!  Don't waste your money. Had to purchase a different connector that would separate more easily.
1.0,Fell apart literally the components that are assembled just came apart today in my hands. ?? I don't get it since this has been garage kept & not abused. I'm looking for another alternative . Buyer beware.
5.0,Fantastic purchase experience and merchandise.
5.0,...this connector is better than most since you can open the valve without anything attached and get a full flood of water...
5.0,I must have 8 of these. Hoses and sprinklers everywhere. Makes switching simple. Hose end sprayers snap on and off easily
1.0,"The shut off valve literally disintegrated within seconds of using it for the first time in a regular back yard hose with average water pressure. I rarely write reviews, but people need to be warned to stay away from this product. Zero stars."
5.0,"I bought a large number of these in 2010 and now I have just bought more.  For the female end, I only by the ones with the shutoff valve.  This is because when I have used the cheaper ones without the valve in places I don't think I need a valve, I almost always wish  I had the valve.  It's just not worth keeping track of two kinds.  They are always a little bit of work getting set up in the spring, but stick with it.  Its not so useful having them on only some connections (I'm cheap by nature so that's the first place I go).  Now I put them ion every connection, no comprimising.  They are plastic and occasionally do break, that's why I make sure to buy them at a low price and in good qauntity.  I recommend wetting the connectors before assembling so they go together easier.  They can be a little stiff in the spring but once in action they are awesonme."
4.0,"I liked this product. My wife (who was the intended beneficiary) was not able to operate them well and opted for removing them and using the screw on hose fitting instead. Disappointing, but still, well made and works as intended."
3.0,"As an fyi, this hose will kink a lot. Otherwise, it works fine."
5.0,Good quality.
4.0,Much better than the vinyl hoses these replaced. Good price
4.0,"Love the high pressure rating
but the connections aren't rated so high, perhaps 50psi ... if lucky
Love it's rubber, the ONLY hose worth any investment at all, the rest are pick pockets
Quality brass connectors"
5.0,"Nice strong sturdy hose, doesn't kink and easy to roll up. Works perfectly for my needs."
5.0,Very durable hose!
5.0,"Folks, keep in mind: this IS a commercial grade, cumbersome and very heavy! If you're a little grandma just wanting to water your flowers, go with a lighter, self-winding hose!  I'll have to do the same, after I give this one to my son. It is a very good quality for a good price."
5.0,"Rubber hoses are the best, I really like this product; it's just what I needed for a shorter hose requirement.  Had one of those shrinking hoses to minimize size of hose, but it literally exploded after developing an ""aneurism"" in less than one season of use.  Never buy one of those types again."
5.0,nice hose
5.0,"I like rubber hoses and I really like this this hose - it is flexible, it is easy to maneuver around in the garden, and it is easy to handle when rolling it up - plus, for a rubber hose the price was right.

I have lost count on the number of non-rubber hoses that that I have replaced in the past couple of years.  I have had them burst and/or leak on me after what I consider to be an unreasonably short amount of time.  I have tossed because they were so stiff that I could hardly straighten them, or that they were really heavy, or that I had difficulty rolling them up on my hose reel.

However I have never had a rubber hose with any of those problems. The rubber hoses are not stiff, they are not overly heavy, and they are easy to coil on the ground or wrap on a hose reel.

If my rubber hoses get a kink in them I just give them a slight twist and they work fine. I have 3 black rubber garden hoses. One of the rubber hoses that I use I have left under pressure (70 p.s.i.) 24/7 for maybe 7 years, in freezing cold and in 114 degree heat, and have never had a problem with it. That is not to say that this red rubber hose will perform the same way but I am betting that it will.

Having said all of this:
1.  Can you live with a red hose in your green garden? I can because I like all of it's positive attributes.
2.  If you use a black rubber hose, over time it can leave black marks on your walkway or even your hands. Only time will tell if I end up with red marks on my walkway or hands. LOL"
2.0,Not easy to disconnect. Poor product quality. I will not recommend.
1.0,I purchased three sets and all three were defective. It is almost impossible to disconnect. Don't buy! These are not eligible for return!!!
1.0,Worst product ever. Didn't disconnect once inserted. Had to pry off with hammer and prybar. Even worst there is no return on this product.
1.0,Almost impossible to connect and disconnect. On top of that they are non-returnable?????  Real Junk.  Save your money.  I should have listened to the other reviews.
1.0,"Not impressed at all. You can't unplug the end while the valve is open because there isn't enough clearance. Even when you close the valve it's SO hard to unplug because it's tight.  The mechanism just doesn't work.  Had purchased ones by Melnor before at the store and they were much better but I can't find the ones with the on/off valve built in.  Also, Amazon the seller wouldn't allow a return on this product.  No clue why."
1.0,it started not work at all.
5.0,"Installed in all my hoses to quickly change hose accessories, sprayer, sprinkler, hose to hose."
3.0,"One of these connectors was fine the other (I bought 2) would not release no matter what I did. A call to Amazon customer service solved the problem with a new one that also worked fine. But they are inexpensive so I'm happy, thanks Amazon."
1.0,No i understand why the Gardena products are so expensive. They work. These do not. A lot of the Gilmore nozzles have a restricted handle too.
1.0,Does not work smoothly.  Takes two men and a boy to connect and disconnect.
1.0,GARBAGE
4.0,"Good quality product, it still kinks though"
2.0,"My big indictment is this hose kinks ridiculously. I returned it after trying to load it onto my hose reel and I had 5 or six folded over kinks. I knew I would endlessly fight this hose so I wrapped it back up and sent it back, done!"
2.0,"Bought this because of its alleged anti-kinking properties.  Feels soft, but kinks easily, maybe more so than a cheap green hose.  Very unimpressed."
5.0,"Handles hot water temperature up to 120 degrees at full city water pressure. With an adopter to connect with my high pressure spray handle, worked well to do low pressure/hot water patio cleanup to remove surface dirt and hard water deposits without having to bring out high pressure washer."
2.0,"It is a great hose, its issue is the rings that are included in the couplings. They are poor quality and hard plastic. I invested in some rubber rings, replaced the white plastic one and now have a really superb hose. Took a little work, but this is way better then most other hoses with the small adjustment."
3.0,Hose kinks easily.
2.0,"The hose works fine for now.  The reason for the low rating is that the black piece at the end of the hose that helps to support the hose was mostly torn off when I got the item and fell off the rest of the way as I was attaching it to the spigot.

I may have to lower this review if the hose collapses under its own weight while hot water is running through it."
5.0,Awesome high temp hose!
5.0,Works
2.0,"the original Gilmour yellow connectors much better, will try Ace hardware and see what they have"
1.0,"As has been reported by many others, this ""quick"" connect is essentially unusable due to the force required to both connect and also disconnect.  I have been using this type of hose connector (several brands) for 30 years and have never come across any that don't work as designed, until these.  I will be asking for a refund but if I have to actually send these back I will instead toss them in the recycling bin and take a $ loss."
2.0,"I had to request a refund for these and the extra male connectors I had purchased.  I had problems with the male connector pulling out when I barely was moving the hose.  I also had some leakage problems.
I must say, though, I received a refund with no problems."
3.0,"It broke, but under hard use with a deep feeder."
4.0,Good product
4.0,Good
4.0,Good Item but subject to jaming in the reciever end.
1.0,Male hose end adapter has collar on it.  Pix doesn't show a collar.  The collar keeps it from fitting into my faucet.
1.0,Put the two parts together - can't separate them even with a pair of channel-locks.  Junk.
3.0,Difficult to disconnect fromhose
1.0,"Defective manufacture. I bought 3 of these and none of the three would connect and hold the male adapter. I've never had much luck with Gilmour products, but this one might the worst yet."
1.0,the quick release is HORRIBLE very difficult to pull back and release the male adapter.  bought 2 units and have replaced both already. The male connector part is ok.
5.0,"Some people complain that they are hard to pull apart but I've figured it out. The mechanism you pull down to release the adapter interferes with the flow switch. If the flow switch is open, you can't release the piece. Also, there can't be any water pressure. So, turn off the water, close the flow valve and its very easy to take apart. It works with all my other quick release pieces that are not the same brand."
1.0,"These connect quickly BUT they do not disconnect.  I wanted to replace others that I've had for years.  Some were broken from being stepped on or dropped and I thought it was time.  These were a total waste of time and money.  I really needed to disconnect the nozzle from the hose and connect the fertilizer sprayer and had to resort to a small pry bar to force the connectors apart.  I spent way too much time on this and it was infuriating.  There was nothing ""quick"" about it.  It took most of my morning to do a simple thing.  They are going in the trash."
1.0,"Horrible, the end with the shut off valve is impossible to disconnect even with a channel lock & pliers. 2 kits, both the same. Returning them. Never seen any quick connects this bad. Connects just fine, just won't disconnect so it's useless"
1.0,Found connection to leak. I was getting about 1 to 2 drops per second. That's not a lot but very annoying.
2.0,I don't like these connector they are very hard to disconnect my sprinkler heads when I want to attach a another fitting. I would not recommend them.
5.0,Work great - have not been able to find in stores.
1.0,"Ok, it is a quick CONNECTOR but the PROBLEM is that it is impossible to disconnect it!  I never leave reviews but this is just wrong.  Even my husband had quite the struggle to strongarm it to release finally.  Not useable.  Should be taken off the market."
5.0,Works well and fits well.
5.0,No kinks. Heavy duty!
1.0,Sold as 5/8 in hose - forgot to mention flow reduction in the hose
5.0,Nothing beats an all-rubber garden hose.......period
5.0,Good quality hose for the price. I wish I would bought a '50 foot but that's my bad.
5.0,A Very Durable Hose that is more commercial and industrial than others that claim to be
5.0,no problems with it being in the sun all day. I use it with my pool automatic water leveler.
5.0,GOOD HOSE
5.0,Good quality
5.0,"Really good quality; better than any I found in the big home center stores.  This is a short hose though, which is fine for me in a condo, but beware of the size you buy if you need more length."
3.0,This hose kinks really easily.  Seems to be durable ... time will tell.
5.0,"I love these connectors, they make watering so much easier switching attachments."
4.0,No leaks!
5.0,"These hose connectors work great! I l primarily bought them as they have the manual shut off rather then the connectors that shut off when you disconnect and turn on the water as soon as you reconnect to another sprinkler or spray head. With the auto shut off connectors you can get wet and also you can not adjust the volume of water to the sprinkler, while at the sprinkler, when you need to adjust the volume to cover the area you want."
1.0,"Junk. Bought these as replacement for another plastic set, possibly by the same manufacturer. Once joined they wouldn't disconnect without enormous effort. Nothing ""quick"" about it. I tried WD-40 and it helped but only if the disconnect was made immediately after use. If I left the hose and wand or sprinkler connected overnight, the advantage was gone. On more than one occasion, I had to remove the connected pieces from the hose and sprinkler and use a vice grip to pull back the female end to release the male end. The last one just broke apart in my hand when I tried to get the pieces apart and I didn't use the vice grip that time. It seems that when the base is pulled back the white clasps or clips that are inside the female end do not retract far enough to release the male end easily.

I've used brass quick disconnects in the past, but they leak. These didn't leak, I'll say that much for them."
4.0,I've been using these for years and they last a few season of abuse. The only complaint is that it is often hard to detach and attachment since there is a small area to grasp the sliding part of the connector.
4.0,I buy these every year.  I love them because I don't need to turn my hosemail off every time I use it.  They do get loose over time and need to be tightened with a Phillips screwdriver. For the price I don't mind replacing them every year.
4.0,Seems to work well.
3.0,Very hard to remove attachments.
1.0,"It is a quick connect as advertised, just don't try and disconnect it.  Won't release.  Piece of crap.  Save your money."
1.0,Don't even think about this item.  Impossible to separate once connected. The worst product ever purchased.
5.0,"Great product, fast shipping!"
1.0,"I took them out of the box and put the small part into the large quick connector and you CANNOT get them apart again.

I tried and tried and no way can I do it.  The part on the large piece that's supposed to slide down to allow you to remove the smaller part will not slide down.  And yes I did turn the shutoff sideways to give me more room and still no good.

This is not the first set of Gilmour connectors I have owned.  Several years ago I bought a bunch of these at Lowe's, the green and black ones though, same as these except the color is different.  And they worked fine, but as they got older they became very hard to disconnect.  So I figured maybe dirt or whatever got inside and was making it harder to undo them and why I thought buying new ones would work better.  Boy was I wrong, these new ones I got are worse then my old ones to disconnect.

I just did a return on these two and had to leave the ones I connected still together cause it was impossible to undo them."
4.0,"Hard to get off and on, plastic isn't an ideal medium for this type of connection, however they do work and aren't $20 for a single. So if you want something rock solid go brass, but if you just want something simple, this is fine. on off switch is really nice, as is extra nozzle attachments."
1.0,Quick disconnect doesn't. Very difficult to use. Major legue aggravation. Poor Quality. Company does not respond to any complaints. Totally ignores costomer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3.0,This breaks if you have good water pressure.  The finger valve blows off.
1.0,"Was going to buy another connector set...NOT ANYMORE.  I can't even disconnect the one I  currenlty own.  I unscrewed everything and used plier and a gloved hand.  Now going to try some spray silicone.  Too bad...my yellow colored Gilmour quick connectors that lasted over 10 years fit this newer one. I've struggled since ""day 1"" to ""quickly disconnect with ease.  WASTE OF MONEY, switiching to Nelson.  Hope that brand works better."
1.0,"I bought a big starter set of these, then I bought 8 of these smaller kits to go along with them. Over half of the female quick connects are extremely difficult to disconnect, which is disappointing. I have one that will not come apart at all. Completely ruins the whole reason of purchasing them, to save time and hassle."
3.0,Very hard to release the quick connect.  The sliding shoulder should be another 1/4 inch longer to give it more range of motion.  Will not buy again.
1.0,I've several sets of these that I purchased both on Amazon and at a local hardware store. This batch will not connect either to each other or to the older sets. So I went to the hardware store and bought the exact same product and these work reasonably well. Though it is obvious that Gilmour has gone to a lower quality supplier.
4.0,exact replacement for the fittings that came with my spot free car wash water filter
5.0,Great hose!
5.0,"I bought this for its thermal qualities - I wanted an inexpensive outdoor hose that would remain flexible at low temps (I live in Juneau, AK) and this one suits just fine.  Does it kink?  Yup. Care is needed when spooling/unspooling by hand. Is that  dealbreaker?  Not for me.  Head and shoulders above any vinyl product I've yet to find.

1.0,"Very bad purchase!! Should have returned it!! Poorly executed design Apex. Don't care if it's made of rubber with a crush proof solid brass octagon the hose is unusable! Like one critique put it ""It seems to have been designed to kink. Never leave a hose rolled out to avoid the kinking as the water will heat up inside and burn a nice line in your lawn. Two thumbs down!!"
5.0,"One year in, and it's a good reminder that all-rubber is the way to go. Forget Craftsman ""rubber"" which is actually cheap vinyl with a rubber coating.

As to the question of whether this hose kinks, it doesn't kink any more than any other hose. when it does, all it takes is a quick twist from where you're standing to correct -- it's usually not necessary to walk over to the kink to correct it"
1.0,The hose is great quality but both ends are female connections. The hose cannot be attached to nozzle without a female to male adapter. This should be clearly stated on the description...
4.0,Seems pretty sturdy. Hope it holds up over time.
5.0,Excellent value!
1.0,Purchased 2 of these Hot water hoses. Withing 2 months both have bubbled up and cracked. Lifetime Guarantee?
5.0,Works great.  Previous hose got leaks in it so I upgraded to this one for washing my truck.  No leaks so far!
5.0,shipped fast.nice25 fthoae.
1.0,Finally after a month an half of it getting of it lost in transit i finally received it and now the water  hose has holes in it like some one put a bunch of pin holes in it its no good to me send new one ill send this one back in box
3.0,"While this hose is very flexible and rated for hot water, I was disappointed to see that the fittings on the hose I received aren't brass! They appear to be gold colored aluminum or some other similar metal which many manufacturers are using now.  This may not be a problem for most people unless you are one who has water with high mineral content.  As a result, I have to use a plastic coupling between the hose fitting and the metal sprinkler connection. (Not doing so with fittings that aren't brass can cause the fitting to ""weld"" itself to the sprinkler fitting!)  The other issue is a minor one, but still annoying. The black plastic guard seen on the female fitting end of the hose does not stay in place so really serves no purpose that I can see."
5.0,"Great product, no problems."
5.0,Good heavy hose. No kinks no problems. Would buy it again.
5.0,perfect
5.0,Great hose.
5.0,Love it
5.0,I use this hose to go from my water barrel to a pump. It worked flawlessly for this application! It's sturdy to withstand the pressure of the suction from the pump.
1.0,broke at the nozzle end.
1.0,Hose very stiff and twists constantly.  Hard to take off the hose holder and hard to put on.  The good news is that it will probably last 10 years.
5.0,"I live in a very heavily wooded area and have used this rake for over 6 seasons without failure.  I added a couple more to my tool rack, just in case they become ""hard to find""."
5.0,"These are VERY high quality hoses, and are worth every penny.
Remember, you get what you pay for!
I used the very handy 25' length to connect irrigation hoses to the tap without having to coil excess hose from too-long hose."
5.0,"This seems to be very good hose.  I've purchased 3 of them recently.  I purchased a midrange quality vinyl hose at Walmart last year and every time it kinks (which is every time I use it and pull it across the yard) I THINK OF THE GREAT DEAL THAT I GOT!  AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD HEARS MY EXPLETIVES.  ""Sounds like Billy-Bob is using his cheap hose again!""

Buy quality if you can afford it.  After the purchase price you'll never think again about the cost if the item gives you good service."
4.0,nice price for the hose
5.0,Very happy with the rubber hose.  I would order another one if needed.
5.0,great
2.0,"Factory defect, one end wasn't crimped.  It blew off the first time I used it."
5.0,"Best hose ever. Sturdy, commercial grade and won't get holes like the cheap green ones everyone buys. You can put your money on this hose especially if you use it a lot for gardening, washing the car, etc."
4.0,"I don't give this hose five stars only because it kinks. However, to be fair, I knew it would before purchase. So far it serves my needs just fine.  I will certainly follow up if it fails to deliver."
1.0,"Boy oh boy, I'm getting so tired of buying products that are so poorly made or are otherwise very disappointing and then having the return windows closed such that I cannot return them.  That doesn't happen with brick and mortar stores.  Anyway, I bought two of these and both leak at the connectors which started the very first time I used them.  On one of them, the black plastic piece is already splitting, again during the very first use.  Oh, and on one I need to file a place on the connector because a piece of the metal sliced my thumb when I tried to screw it onto the faucet.  Well, I'm stuck with this product and will have to mitigate the problems, at more expense, in order to continue using them.  Lesson learned:  Never buy anything from Amazon.com that I cannot use immediately."
1.0,The hose kinks all the time.
4.0,"This hose works well, but is really easy to kink.  Its fairly pliable, and may hold up well, but is a little harder to use than reinforced hose because of the tendency to kink."
5.0,Fantastic water hose. Best one I have ever owned.
4.0,It appears to be sturdy. I hope it lasts for years. I would give it a 5 star if it last at least 5 years.
5.0,Great value!
5.0,Very sturdy! Doesn't leak or kink!!
5.0,Great Hose!

This hose is surprisingly light in weight, but it's super thick and sturdy.  It's so good, I am going to actually buy another one.  I paired it with a quality Brass USA made nozzle for a great car washing experience.  So much better than the cheap flimsy vinyl hoses"
5.0,"I purchased this for my carpet cleaning company, and it works great!  It's really sturdy and has great pressure.  I'm glad I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on an electric one."
5.0,sprayer works great. great value. alot better than cheap plastic sprayers.sprayer will still dribble a little upon button release because once the presure drops in the wand the spray loses its mist form.
3.0,"lightweight & flimsy. The plastic hose is stiff and the plastic trigger valve leaks terribly.

Hudson 67215 Bugwiser Stainless Steel 1 Gallon Sprayer"
4.0,"Purchased Hudson #67215 sprayer to use for every possible application around the home. First use was to spray warm water to remove wallpaper. After testing the spray patterns, the fan spray is a real heavy spray and not a fine mist and the stream spray is as advertised. I feel it is a good investment for the price and with proper care and cleaning should last a very long time.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it tends drip out of the nozzle when not in use, and it was not over pressurized."
5.0,"This is a great sprayer, easy to assemble. I threw away my other plastic ones. I wish I had bought this before."
1.0,The pump broke during first use.  It's cheaply made.  Had to return it.
5.0,"This Hudson sprayer is everything that I had
hoped for.  It has a good gasket seal and is
easy to use.

One thing, if using Clorox or other bleach,
do not let solution sit in tank for a long
time.  The brass nozzles will start to build
up a blue corrosion and will need to be disassembled
to clean them.

This was not a fault of the sprayer....just a
fault of the owner.  I should have cleaned it
after use.

Val Garon
Prairieville, La"
3.0,"it is ok, black housing doesn't serve much of a purpose...it came cracked"
4.0,Retains coil memory. Occasionally kinks. Sturdy fittings.
4.0,"I bought two 25ft hoses  I only use one, but in case it breaks or goes bad, I have a backup or if I need more hose I can always attach the 2 anyway I do like the hose, good strong material rolls up nicely, good color.  Definitely worth it and would most definitely purchase one again."
2.0,Kinks very easily but it's short enough that it's not much of an issue.
2.0,"Not ""Industrial Duty"" kinks very easily and not as stiff as one would expect.  Kinkguard sleeve broke after first use.  Started leaking after one year from the hose end.  Only Pro is it works well with hot water."
5.0,Great product with the best price I could find
5.0,Worth the extra.
1.0,Cheaply made hole in side if hose on the first use
4.0,"Purchased this hose to use on the T&P valve for hot water heater.
Works great for the application and still had 15' of hose for ???
Reason for only 4 stars, the hose is so thick that I can't get a new hose end on it."
5.0,"Well, it's a hose, but I do appreciate the real brass fittings. The others corrode. This will be on the south side of our house in the brutal Texas heat ... we'll see how well it will hold up."
2.0,Not a great quality. Stress reliever was broken. ends do not appear to be crimped correctly.
1.0,"Let me  first state that this is by no means a heavy duty/commercial hose, regardless of how it is advertised. The black (protective) sheaf at the top of the hose cracked on day one, and for some inexplicable reason, this hose almost seems as if it were designed to kink. As soon as i unwound it, the hose kinked along its entire length,even after I laid it completely out and attempted to spin out the kinks."
5.0,"Good construction, I think it will last a long time."
5.0,Good price works good with hot water
5.0,very good quality hose that doesn't really kink
5.0,Great quality and fast service.
5.0,Very strong rubber. Good product.
2.0,Octagonal..not round
5.0,Great quality. No leaks from the valve. Doesn't get twisted like thin hoses.
1.0,"This hose leaked right out of the box. It was frustrating because I had it hooked up to my laundry faucet inside my garage, which has hose threads on it, so it sprayed out beyond the tub getting a bunch of stuff wet. I probably just got a bad one, but I'm returning and am not willing to find out if that's true."
3.0,Could not handle as much pressure as I wanted without leaking from seal.
4.0,The product worked as described. Occasionally the little lock on the sprayer would get stuck and so I would be spraying product like 15-20 seconds while I'm fighting to get it unstuck. It sprays very well and holds and good amount for it's size. Durable.
1.0,"Used it a couple times and the pump piston disconnected from the sleeve.  I had to manually fish the sleeve out and glue them back together.  Really cheap construction, do not buy this.

I used to buy a cheap one from my local supply for like $35, thought this would be better with the metal nozzle and can, but it's just more expensive, similar or less quality for higher price.  Do not buy."
2.0,"It has a nice container and seal, but the sprayer is atrocious. It takes at least 3 to 5 seconds to shut off after you release the lever. There is also no pressure release."
5.0,Works great!! Well worth the money. If you plan to use it for multiple applications I recommend buying a multiuse nozzle.
1.0,Garbage
5.0,"I like it so far, it's the right size for my backyard garden"
1.0,Don't buy it. As soon as I opened the box I knew it was cheap and wouldn't last. The only metal part is the container  The main seal doesn't hold and it doesn't spray because of that. This happened the first time I tried to use it.
1.0,"garbage.  barely holds pressure so it can't achieve a decent range or a fine mist.  the best you can expect is a blobby spray with large droplets.  hose and trigger are cheaply made plastic and feel like a less expensive poly unit.  Ironic since the poly units work much better.  Save your money, this is pretty bad.  Hudson customer service is a joke, after 35 minutes+ on hold and no one has an clue how the product works."
5.0,"Very satisfied, works well!"
1.0,"broke during first use.  Bought a B&G and haven't looked back.  I gave this sprayer away to someone within my company who could fix it and keep it, and he ended up throwing it in the trash."
1.0,"VERY CHEAPLY ,MADE"
5.0,arrived on the first eta date product fair price and as disscribed
1.0,After a year of minimal usage the tank has rusted and the pump isn't working. Returning.
5.0,Work good
1.0,"The can and pump work fine, but the wand attachment is thinly threaded, soft plastic.  It strips after just a few times of removing and reattaching it.  It's both a poor design and poorly manufactured.  Unfortunately, bought two of these doggies, and both had the same problem, so it didn't happen by chance.  If you want a stainless sprayer, spend more and buy a Solo.  I have one that's older than the Hudsons and has worked great with heavy use."
5.0,"They are terrific for the price. I used  them in my exterminating business before I retired. Try it, you'll like it from Amazon.com  ...Larry Brown"
5.0,"boil water in pot or kettle (never heat the sprayers tank!!!), mix with cool water already in tank to raise it to the temp you want it to be (remember, there are still plastic parts in the sprayer, so don't make it to hot to melt the sprayer and or hot water burn a person) pump it up and you now her pressureized warm water anywhere - great for camping and Burning Man"
5.0,THE PRICE IS FANTASTIC....NICE...COMFORTABLE...EASY TO HANDLE....NO DRIPS. I CAN USE DIFFERENTS..KIND OF CHEMICALS..OR WATEVER..I USE IT..ESPECIALLY...SPRAYING...CHEMICALS...FOR..THE ROACHES...ECT..IN APTS....IT MAKES MY DAY..SO COOOOOOL.....THANK U....
1.0,Did not like it. It's cheaply made and it leaks everywhere  would not recommend it for anyone to buy where can I send it back to?
5.0,"The price is great, A little thinner than exspected but price makes up for it. Good solid brass fitttings. Cant complain."
1.0,"poor quality, the female connection is too short to completely connect to the male connector, the hose seems like it would crack easily...returned for refund"
4.0,Not what i would consider heavy duty but it does hold form better than thinner hose.  Quality connections but they might not hold up under abuse.
5.0,Outstanding short hose
1.0,It started to leak at connector within minutes.  It's not even worth returning.
1.0,Hose leaked immediately when I turned it on..low quality..definitely not industrial for a detail shop
5.0,"WOW-Can't believe a product is still made in the USA and is of ""HIGH"" quality. I give it a 10 star review."
5.0,wish it was 5 feet longer
5.0,Thanks
5.0,these last for years with abuse
5.0,"This is a very well made Sprayer. Quality, spray-pattern, and durability expectations are exceeded with this sprayer. If you've used other, lower price point sprayers before then this sprayer's quality will be remarkable."
5.0,Hard to find a 1 Gallon stainless steel tank. Worth the extra few bucks over a cheap plastic one if your gonna use it a lot.
1.0,I paid big bucks for the Hudson 67215 Bugwiser Stainless Steel 1 Gallon Sprayer expecting quality.  What I got leaked all over Me.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5.0,"It is a nice sprayer but when I got it, it was missing the tip. So I tried calling the company which by the way say 24 hour service. The only time you can get a real person is 7:am-6:pm day time. Then you have to wait forever for someone to answer the phone. It toke me 2 days to finally get to a real person to tell them about the tip. The sent me one 10 days later.
  There idea of customer service and my idea of customer service is different."
5.0,Years and years ago I bought my first Hudson sprayer and it has given us good service.  We've bought a couple more over the years and Hudson has replacement parts for all of their sprayers.  Way to go Hudson!  It's sure nice to have a company that you can depend on.
5.0,"Everything about my purchase of this sprayer was uneventful.  The product arrived immediately, the assembly was fast and easy and the sprayer works perfectly.  Pretty boring but I sometimes I like boring"
5.0,"Instructions do not cover completely; but lubing the plunger cup IS A MUST! The plunger cup can be lubed with any petroleum based lubricant such as Vaseline. This might save you a call to customer service which was great help....otherwise this is an excellent sprayer and I will be ordering a second sprayer with in a few days.

Sailor Man"
5.0,"This is a great thing to buy, never will buy a plastic one again. Easy to clean, easy to pump, holds pressures for months. I love this!!!!"
1.0,"I used this sprayer for weeds. It has only been used 10 times and I have to throw it away. The valve broke after 4 uses and was replaced by the manufacturer. Now, the pump is broken rendering the unit unusable. It is really a piece of junk - not well constructed. I had to purchase two hose clamps early in it's life to keep the hose on during use. The manufacturer did not even think of suppling these hose clamps. We have a Chapin sprayer used for many years. We will replace this one with another Chapin."
5.0,"It's very hard to find a one gallon sprayer that is stainless steel. I don't need more than a gallon at a time, so this one works out perfect. I do need an extension on the wand. The wands are always too short!"
4.0,"Looks to built of very good quality. It is the winter time, so I cannot check the anti-kink, or leaking factors. The Rubber hose is very heavy and the hose itself is solid."
5.0,Great product
5.0,just what I needed
4.0,Has not kinked up and has with stand the winter weather.
5.0,Always buy the heaviesy hose you can find.  You will never regret it.
5.0,Best hose I have ever owned.
5.0,great product very happy
5.0,Great for everyday use with hot water. Haven't had any problems with this product.
4.0,"Very nice hose, but kinks easily."
5.0,Bought it and hooked up with hot water. It works really well and still working after a year.
1.0,Horrible! Don't buy! To small for a Samsung s7. Now the edge around the screen isn't even staying on. Don't buy!
5.0,just what i needed
4.0,"Seems decent. Needed a rubber hose for filling outdoor troughs in our cold climate (-25F not uncommon here). The vinyl hoses just don't last.  This one is a little cheaper than the black rubber version by Craftsman.  It kinked up on first use in a way that didn't give me a lot of confidence for long term durability.  I have the black Craftsman version and it's been a durable option for many years. Only time will tell, but if you can swing the extra $, the black rubber hose by Craftsman is a proven winner after many cold winters and this one, while less $ also seems to be slightly lower quality. Hoping it lasts, but if I have to replace, won't hesitate to go back to the Craftsman."
5.0,Very heavy duty. It's not kink proof but I'm satisfied with quality.
4.0,ok good quality
5.0,Needed a strong hose for a small area!!
5.0,Used to deliver water to outdoor fountain in below freezing temperatures.  Works great.  Hose does not change shape during hot or cold delivery.
5.0,Great quality and excellent value. Should last a long time.
3.0,It becomes kinked easily.  Very floppy.
5.0,Great product.  I purchased it to replace a hose that broke.  It works great...I only wish it came in a 35' length...25' is a little too short but the 50' is way too long and heavy.
5.0,Good quality good price... buy it!
5.0,The best hose one can buy. Absolutely no kinking.
5.0,It's an expensive hose but worth the money.  No kinks yet!
4.0,It rolls up nicely and doesn't kink which is the biggest problem with most hoses.  This is a great utility hose.
5.0,excellent quality so is the price
5.0,Wonderful hose for the price.  We will be buying a lot more of these for the farm.
5.0,"Great quality, thick rubber, should last for years unlike the cheap thin ones."
5.0,Used for a counterflow chiller build. Perfect for my needs.
5.0,Very good quality hose for the money
5.0,"High quality hose, made in the USA?"
5.0,"Best hose I've ever used. No kinks, works well with hot water. I just wish they sold a NSF approved drinking water version of this hose."
5.0,Looks and functions great!
5.0,Used this hose to build a counterflow chiller for chilling my beer wort.  It worked great!
5.0,"Spend the money on red rubber hoses.  They last.  They are well built, they don't kink up like those hard plastic cheapo's.  Buy it once, keep it a long time, or buy cheap, fight it every use, and watch it mess up in a short time."
5.0,"Compared to the all black rubber hose it is a little lighter and therefore better move-able. Water does not get that hot in the sun.
Noticed that 25 ft is even short in a small garden but I did not want another >= 50ft. Heavy connectors, tight fit, no leaks."
5.0,"Good value for an industrial duty rubber hose.  Rubber is not as light and flexible as a lightweight vinyl hose, but it is definately more durable.  So be advised, this is heavy and bulky but does not tangle easily."
5.0,"Have had this hose a couple of months, so far it works as advertised."
4.0,Good quality ! A little heavy but worth it
5.0,This hose is of superior quality.  It is very supple and appears to be very well made.  Great product!  It is well worth the money.
4.0,"Great American made product. I use it constantly and it has held up awesome, no kinks or leaks in the brass. Just replace the washer every year and it'll last for a long time."
5.0,Just as I expected.
5.0,"Really good hose, well worth the money"
5.0,heavy duty but flexible enough to MANAGE!
5.0,nice quality - I needed an extension and got a nice no leak connection
5.0,Use this for my hot water heater semi annual drainage. Works perfectly!!
5.0,Everything as advertised!
5.0,"I have learned over the years to always buy industrial grade despite the extra cost.  While this particular product is a little short of some true industrial grade hoses that I have used, the cost savings more than makes up for it.  It never kinks while sitting there laid out on concrete and grass.  Once in use, it may kink from twisting, but not from bends.  I never roll it up like I'm supposed to and even in this unbearable summer heat in Southern California, it works great.  A great product at a great price.  Nothing else a consumer can ask for."
5.0,Worked perfectly for flushing out the hot water heater. Good quality hose for hot water use.
5.0,awesome
5.0,love how well it works
5.0,Heavy duty hose that will not shrivel like a limp noodle when hot water is run through.  Great for the hose out portion of my counter flow chiller for beer.
5.0,great item
4.0,Durable product
2.0,"It does the job of any hose but it's surprisingly thin and kink's very easily for an ""industrial Duty"" hose.  I think the hoses at Harbor Freight for 40% less money offer the better value."
4.0,As promised.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for - very durable!
5.0,"A great, durable, flexible rubber hose at  a great price."
5.0,"Kinks too easy, otherwise, a nice hose."
3.0,The hose got a kink in it within a month.
5.0,"As pictured, described and expected and it arrived on time."
5.0,Good durable hose. I got tired of the crap vinyl hoses that pin hole and kink! This uis HEAVY DUTTTTTYYYYYY!
5.0,"Great product, as described"
1.0,Industrial Duty it is not. It kinks and has soft walls like all cheap hoses and in the end you get what you pay for. I was fooled by the Industrial Duty picture and its also not Commercial. Spend more for a longer lasting hose.
5.0,"Great hose, dose not kink."
5.0,"Excellent hose. I use it in my butcher shop with the 180F scalding water we use for washing and sanitizing equipment, tables, walls, ceilings, floors, etc."
5.0,"It will kink if it is pulled out with twists, however it pops right back into shape without comprising the hose's integrity. No problems so for with a few month's use."
5.0,"Solid, well made, and will probably last for years."
5.0,"heavy duty, seems well built quality"
5.0,"OK not sure if anyone else has done this.  I am remodeling the basement.  That being said I ran a new cold water line outside and then ran a new hot water line outside.  I built an outdoor shower with a water spicket for bathing the dog.  I have already used it for, yup you guessed it, not bathing the dog.  Cleaning things, etc.  I will be using it for the dog though...  That being said it was a great hose for a great deal!!!!"
4.0,good quality hose but measures only 23 ft. 6 inches.. NOT 25 FEET !
5.0,"This flag replacement works great. Our flag was the old metal type that you have to lift and then turn it down. Well, a LOT of the times the pull up was forgotten, and the flag was bent almost in half. Only took a couple of those til it broke off. This went in easy, in the same holes from the old one. (Removing the old rivets was NOT fun..) One nut on the inside, and it works great. It is a much more simple up and down, one motion. Maybe this one will last a while! Well Made and Recommended if you need a good replacement flag."
2.0,"Unfortunately I bought the wrong type of flag. My mailbox needs a TWO hole attachment, which is not available here."
5.0,Most replacement flags I have found are made of plastic and sorta flimsy.  This particular flag fairly heavy steel and has very flex.  There is a good coating paint too.
1.0,"Maybe I was hoping to just replace my broken flag, but the holes didn't match up to the one in my mail box, so I have to drill new holes and plugin other holes.  I was only looking to swap something really quick and the design wasn't as good as what was on my mailbox"
5.0,"This replacement flag is designed for a metal mailbox, however it will work nicely on brick mailboxes, provided you drill an appropriate-sized hole for a plastic wedge anchor and stainless screw. You also must drill shallow holes to accomodate extensions on the back of the base to prevent the base from moving as the flag is moved up and back.  All of the drilling is simple using the included template.  I am quite pleased with this product."
5.0,great so far.
5.0,I use this 25 ft hose to drain my hot water heater to get rid of sediment.  It works great and seems to be well made.
5.0,I only used it once but I have no complaints
5.0,"Very well constructed, this will most likely last several years"
5.0,Love it. Great Product!
5.0,perfect for the space I needed
5.0,"While it is more expensive to buy smaller lengths and link them together, it is much easier to manage 25 feet of hose as opposed to 50 or 100.  I know of what I speak after managing very long, heavy duty hoses for years.  I was always getting soaked every time I watered my gardens so I finally had enough.  ENOUGH!  The Apex rubber hose while it does kink, it is only 25 feet so really for all the drama I have had in the past, rotating the hose to remove the kink is no big deal and again, 25 feet is easy to unkink.  It is a great hose and since I have an outdoor hot water and cold water spigot so this is the perfect hose. You also need to invest in good hose connectors.  The plastic and metal ones just don't give you the best, leak-proof connection.  I have own probably about 25 to 50 of these of all brands and I am throwing every single one of them away today (along with the old hoses!).  The Hoselink connections are the best.  You don't even need to twist them together all the way to get a perfect leak-proof connection.  I do also use brass shut off valves because it is important to note the connectors do not shut off the water when not connected.  Finally, the Radius Garden Butterfly nozzle is fantastic.  All my old nozzles are going to the trash too.  Everything is have recommend you can buy on Amazon."
5.0,Works great
5.0,"This hose works great.  I was a little afraid from the negative reviews...  I live on a farm and this hose gets abused.  I drive over it with the lawn mower, my kids hang it off our deck for climbing purposes?  It does kink every once in a while, but one flip of the hose and its fixed.  I have had many other hoses and I feel that for the money, this is a pretty good one!"
5.0,Soft rubber. Kinks pull out easily.  Seems like it will last a long time.
4.0,Let's face it. It's a mailbox flag.
3.0,this flag did not fit my mailbox.  I did not want to drill a second hole in my mailbox due to precipitation leaks etc. onto my mail.  I got a clip from home depot and rigged it so my old flag worked without additional drilling etc.
5.0,"We have a unique mailbox that had a plastic flag (don't buy one with a plastic flag...they get brittle and break).
So, I found this metal flag and it was shipped in a reasonable time frame and worked perfectly well as a replacement.
All the parts were intact and easily replaced the plastic flag.  Lotus"
5.0,The old flag broke on my mailbox. This one worked as a great replacement with little modification. I just couldn't be happier.
5.0,"Great item, very sturdy and not plastic like the ones you find at Lowe's and Home Depot.  Fast shipping, great value for the money and most of all, this flag shows up!  The other ones you find at the store are smaller and flimsy.  Not THIS one!"
1.0,"I had left a message, I thought with someone. This flag looked just like what I had on my mailbox. When I received it, the tabs on the square plastic piece did not match the holes on the mailbox. Now I'm stuck with a useless flag. Any solutions?"
3.0,Bought this to replace a broken flag on our big business mailbox.  Did not fit.  Made it work but it will break eventually. Looks good anyway.
5.0,"This flag is metal, and won't bow like the others (at least not as badly or as fast)
My only suggestion would be don't try to install it on your own. I tried, dropped the plastic tightener piece in the snow, finally found it, and promptly went inside to get my husband for assistance.  (My dad is a mechanic and I was raised to do my own assemblies and basic car repairs etc, so it wasn't a question of competency...although the -5 degree weather and snow I'm sure didn't help).
HIghly recommend product and will be getting another when this one wears out!"
5.0,"My metal mailbox didn't match up perfectly to the hole on the black piece, but it was no big deal. I drilled a small hole in the mailbox and now the flag fits perfectly. I've had it for a few months now with no issues."
5.0,This was the flag required by our neighborhood and about half the price of our local home depot. It took about 5 minutes to install.
4.0,"This hose stays outside year round, hooked to an irrigation timer and soakers to water the precious Aspens in my front yard.  It has withstood harsh central Orygun weather conditions and remains pliable and functional. I do wish I could have purchased one in black or green rather than red, but that's a minor quibble.  I wanted a tough hose, and this is a tough hose."
1.0,DON'T BUY THIS HOSE! KINKS UP IF YOU LOOK AT IT WRONG! WORSE HOSE I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.
5.0,"i keep it coiled with water heater, excellent for periodic flushing of tankalso good peach of mind if a sudden need arises to drain scalding water."
5.0,Very well made
5.0,"Great strength to this hose, does not kink, and rolls up onto the hose reel quickly. Shipped quickly, too."
1.0,"I don't think these are actually 50ft. They are shorter, and they kink very easy"
5.0,Quality hose
5.0,Ok
5.0,does what it was made for. HOT WATER!  : )  recommended!
4.0,This is a heavy duty hose! I bought it for my horse trailer.
5.0,"Great product, works fine, easy to install.
Does what it is supposed to do so I am satisfied.
The postman gets the message :)"
3.0,"Just so so.  Nothing special and not the best quality, but it will work until I find a better one.  However, it does work, it's just plain."
3.0,"This flag is really designed for the Fulton mailbox.  I tried to use it for a cedar mailbox but the black plastic piece holding the flag has little black feet that seem to be designed to fit into matching holes on the Fulton mailbox.  As a result, I had to return this item.

I would actually recommend this item for someone who needs to replace a flag on a Fulton mailbox."
5.0,works really well and is really easy to install. I put it in the same mail box holes from the old one and it was fine.
2.0,"It does not fit every mail box so read the specifications before purchasing, this is not a very versatile product"
5.0,"Our mail box recently had its flag broken, so I was happy when I found a reasonable and handy replacement"
4.0,"This is just what i wanted, you can not find this flag in the BigBox Home supply stores at all. very well made"
5.0,This is very high quality for the price. It was difficult to find a metal flag. Very easy to put on the mailbox. A very good buy.
5.0,What else can I say except that the flag is metal instead of plastic and that it fit just right.
5.0,"The mailbox we receive our incoming mail in did not have a flag. So a neighbors box with a flag was used. Never had looked for a flag to go on our mail box being made of steel.
When i found this one i was elated.  Easy to drill holes in correct place and put screw through metal to mount and adjust tension.
Very happy to get out of vehicle, and put mail in our box now. No confusion with incoming, outgoing mail in another mailbox.
Sturdy heavy duty materials. Should last a long time."
5.0,"It is what you expect. Not cheap, not great, but affordable and it should last a few years."
5.0,"It's the only hose that work for us, since we use very hot water in our factory.  Lately was very hard to find in other stores, but never here."
5.0,Love it!
5.0,product is as advertised
4.0,Strong and doesn't kink but red color is an eyesore.
5.0,"I needed a short hose to install by the pool pump and filter.  This hose was the perfect length and is easy to unroll/roll.  It has stayed very flexible so far, but I've only had in for 3 months.  We'll see how it looks/works next pool season.  I expect it will be fine, though.  No issues on this product.  I would buy it again."
5.0,"Great quality hose.
Just wish I had ordered 50' instead."
4.0,"I bought this to be used in building a counter-flow chiller for brewing, and it worked great.  It was also the best price for a 25' hose, so it was an excellent value.  The fittings are high-quality - I regret I had to cut them off and throw them away (I soldered fittings directly to copper so I didn't have to rely on band clamps).  1/2"" copper pipe fit well, and sealed well with silicone and band clamps.  Fine choice for counterflow projects."
4.0,use it for hot and cold water.....a very good product
5.0,Works great with H O T water!!
4.0,my older flag is bent and possibly rusted.  this looks like a nice replacement and not too difficult to install
4.0,"This replacement flag mounted to our mailbox without issue. The bracket wasn't compatible with the pre-existing holes, but the package came with a template for drilling new mounting holes.

The flag is durable and stays put when raised.

I would recommend putting silicone into the holes when mounting the flag to prevent water getting into the mailbox in heavy downpours."
5.0,"This is an example of how retail stores are putting themselves out of business, driving customers to buy online.  I checked Lowes, Menards, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, ACE, and Meijer, and the only mailbox flag they had was a small plastic one that typically comes on plastic mailboxes.  And all the different stores had the exact same one.  This is the sturdy, right-sized, metal flag like the original one on many metal mailboxes.  Apparently it is not sold in stores.  Exactly what I wanted an needed.

Arrived quickly, mounted easily, looks great, and seems like it should last years.  No problems.  I used my original base, not the one that came with this (which is plastic - beware, you might subtract a star for that if it matters to you). The one-screw design worked fine just putting the flag onto the top screw of my 2-screw base."
5.0,"It's cold here still so I jury rigged it until I can drill holes with out gloves, but it fit on the old mailbox and works now after a fashion.  Sinc we don't have a Fulton mailbox, it doesn't fit perfect, but obviously will when drill the holes.

No problems, 2 minute install the first time, and 5 minute install when I do it right, but no cold hands at any time, even when installed January 1.  And with free shipping (w/Amazon Prime) how can you beat the price?

It is metal so it will last until we want to replace the mail box, which must be 25 years old and shows it.  But who wants to do that in the middle of winter?  For us it isn't an easy proposition--city codes require a permit, and a 5 foot by 5 foot chunk of sidewalk pulled out since our pole needs to go worse than the mailbox.  No I don't work for Fulton; I'm just a customer."
5.0,"Our mailbox is 25 years old, and the flag just bke off one day. Searching for a replacement, I cam across this fixer upper. It was very easy to replace, and was ust as it was shown in the description. I would definetly recommend this product, and save on having to get the whole mailbox."
4.0,Sturdy. Had to rig it up a little to fit my mailbox but it works just fine and gets the job done!
5.0,"I've had this mailbox flag for about a year and a half. I appreciate the fact that the flag is made out of metal. It appears to have been built to last a while. I mounted it on a mailbox made of brick, and didn't have any trouble. I just drilled a hole with a masonry drill bit, used a plastic hollow wall anchor, and I was in business."
5.0,This was a good choice to replace our broken mailbox flag. The only con is that the flag is metal while the flag holder is plastic. Our old plastic flag failed and the plastic will eventually fail on this one too because of the heat of the sun we experience here in my state.
5.0,"We have a rectangular, wooden mail box that didn't have a flag, and in order for the mail carrier to pick up our mail we'd have to stick it out of the box, which meant no mailing things on a rainy day. When my husband repainted our box and all its hardware, I decided to finally put a flag on it, but didn't want a plastic one from China, which was all I could find in the stores. Amazon to the rescue!

This flag wasn't designed to be used on our type of box. It was impossible to mount the flag in a convenient location on the box without first attaching it to a wood block, which had to be painted to match our mail box, and then screwed onto the mailbox. My husband went to allot of trouble so I could have my little red metal, made in America flag on our fresh white mailbox,with its bold black hardware,and I'm so glad he did; it looks great and works perfectly.

(The flag is metal, the mount and other black piece are plastic.)"
5.0,"what can I say.. its easy to install and it works great.....
I suppose it could be a little more creative ""fish"", etc to pop up instead of a simple flag.. but it does the job.
My mailbox is basically cemented into its stand.. would have been a pain to replace the whole thing."
5.0,"Great hose, heavy duty for farm use!!"
5.0,Needed a extension hose to run under the deck to hose real.  Definitely heavy duty and no worries it will bust without turning off water.  Quality materials used in hose construction and hose connector ends.
5.0,"A very good solid, and reliable hose for hot, and cold water usage. Haven't had any problems with  this product."
1.0,"This hose contains lead. Don't use it for drinking water, bathing or watering food crops."
5.0,works great.
5.0,"Flexible, durable, looks and feels good. Fittings on thee ends attach easily, no leaks. Good price, too"
5.0,I use it with 130 deg F water with no issues.
5.0,"50 Foot Hose

I just picked up another one of these hoses, actually over at HD, but I've got tell you why.

I'm at my home in the desert right now, where I've had one of these for seven years, and it's holding up great. I think that's about 3 years longer than any other hose, because they dry out around here.

But the thing is, I purchased my first one for my place up north near Canada, and 15 years later I'm still using that one when I'm there.

This is a sturdy hose that won't kink at the connection, and it really is pretty good about kinks in general.

Commercial Grade is where it's at, and Apex sells them at a good price."
5.0,Heavy duty and quality construction. A good hose with strong ends.
5.0,Will but again. I like the fact it is so flexible.
5.0,Excellent! We can drive over it and leave it on 24/7 in the sun without issues
5.0,like
5.0,I love this hose!!! High pressure & heat hasn't affected it yet
4.0,Great heavy duty hose
5.0,If you want a durable water hose then rubber is the way to go. I have yet to use any kind of water hose that does not kink but this one is 100x better than vinyl hoses. Will be ordering more.
5.0,Well made and is hard to kink. Easy to drain and hangs nicely. I have 2 others in longer lengths. Stands up to horses walking on them with no damage.
5.0,"I was pleased to find that the hole extended the entire way throughout the hose, rendering it quite easy for water to pass."
5.0,Thank you
2.0,I was really happy with this hose for hot water usage until the fitting going into my spicket pulled itself out and now the hose is shot. Poor construction and no return available. I've had it for three months
5.0,Excellent hose for hot water use.  We use it in our commercial kitchen with lots of employee abuse and commercial cleaners and grease everywhere.  The best hose for the money we've found.
5.0,"Great water hose, very well constructed.  Arrived in a timely manner."
5.0,"perfect, I love it."
4.0,"Good hose but short (not the hose's fault, mine)."
5.0,"It's a garden hose designed to be used with hot water. You pay a little more for ""Hot Water Safe"" hose. This hose gets used every day and seems to be doing exactly as expected. The previous hose was not designed for hot water and was in bad shape in a short time."
3.0,I should have bought rubber washers at the same time as the hose does not fit exactly on the nossel. (sp)
5.0,I need another one of these! Great hose and very good quality!!
3.0,"it's ok, the rubber seems nice and thick, issue I had is it tends to collapse when it bends hard.
 I use it on a real, then connected to another Never Kink 8844-50 Series 4000 Commercial Duty
I prefer the commercial duty one better"
2.0,"Pros:
Hot water went through it ok
Did not leak at spigot

Cons:
Not very solid
Kinks easily

I'd seriously like to send it back."
5.0,We finally have found a hose that can stand up to the abuse of being in a commercial kitchen.  All our others hoses have broken within a couple of weeks.  I highly recommend this hose for commercial applications.  We run extremely hot water through it and it does fine.
4.0,"Holds up well with warm water.
Stays flexible to 20 below 0 F.
Only downside is the hose can kink quite easily."
5.0,It's a hose...but it's a really good hose!
5.0,true rubber hose is the only way to go
4.0,It's pretty good  The Briggs is better
4.0,nice but a little expensive compared to the stores for the same quality.
4.0,Better than other hoses
5.0,This product is great.  We hook it up to our water heater so we can wash our cars on cooler days and it doesn't get hot or weak spots.  We had another hose that blew out due to the hot water.  This one is strong and durable.  It is definitely a quality purchase.
5.0,"As advertised.  Excellent, 25' hose."
5.0,"This hose is used everyday, and is performing great."
5.0,"Used the hose today, very flexible Temp. was about 40 degrees . Glad I bought it."
5.0,just what I wanted heavy duty hose for my garage to wash my car with warm water in winter months and clean equipment with hot water.
5.0,"I needed something to dig down approximately 30 feet.  This auger was perfect.  the handle can be extended with 3/4 inch pipe and couplings.  It got rather heavy lifting the auger out as I dug deeper, but it was doable.  It took approximately three hours to dig down 22 feet.  I hit water at 16 feet so I stopped at 22.  I will use a 4"" PVC pipe for a well casing."
5.0,"My order was receieved a day earlier than expected. Their customer service is fast, courteous, friendly, and professional. I am waiting for another shipment of the same item. I hope to be able to write another good review."
4.0,"A well made tool is a joy to use. Perfect for fence posts. I bought several of these in different sizes for Boy Scout Pioneering projects. They work great in soil and even small kids can make perfect holes. Remember to sharpen them from time-to-time with a file. We marked the hole depth on the tube shaft with a paint marker. The Scouts have a propensity to keep drilling until the handle in on-the-ground and of course, why not if its this easy.  The soil type is important. In our part of southern california we have adobe soil, hard as concrete when dry, like chocolate pudding when too wet. So this tool is best when a hand-full of soil holds a ball shape."
4.0,"Quality, value good."
3.0,this hose faded very quickly to a pink color
5.0,Solid hose.
5.0,"Great hose for hot water applications.  I use it to wash my cars, coupled with the Nelson High Temperature and High-Pressure Rated Rear Trigger Industrial  Spray Nozzle 50501.  Works great!"
5.0,Awesome
5.0,"Great Hot Water Hose. Not to hard, coils up nice."
4.0,"We use this hose for winter running of water to prevent freezing, great job."
5.0,Very heavy duty. This is the strongest hose I've ever owned. Highly recommended.
5.0,My Apex 25 foot Commercial All Rubber Hot Water Hose has held up under high pressure and rough use.
3.0,TO HEAVY FOR AN OLD VET TO PULL AROUND
5.0,"Very high quality hose. It is being used in a ""permanent"" application so I can't comment on flexibility or kinkability."
4.0,"met my expections, but won't last a lifetime, i used this for several months and bubble start to form at the hose. seem like it's going to burst anyday now. it say lifetime warranty but i haven't try to return it."
5.0,very good
4.0,"Just what I needed to drain my hot water tank for the cleaning of deposits at the bottom of the tank.  Just long enough to fit my need and seems well built sturdy fittings that will last for years.  Hot water runs through the hose well.  You must make sure it is straight so the water can drain.  Any hose will kink but this one seems flexible enough to clear potential blockage when straightened.  The lead issue was not one for me.  Obviously, other alternatives need to be made if the water is going to be consumed."
2.0,"In less than a year, this has gone from red to pink.  We do have it in a sunny area, but they say it will last.  If you want a pink/red hose, this is the one for you."
5.0,The only kind of hose to use year round. Does not kink and rolls up easily.
5.0,I used this on our balcony and plug it in to the hot water heater.  Didn't know this existed and ruined several regular hoses due to the high temp.  This is great.
5.0,very good
4.0,Purchased this for Mom and she likes it. Says it is high quality  and much better than the hose this replaced
5.0,"A 25 ft heavy duty hose for $18 delivered is excellent.

I really don't need it for hot water, but in case I do it's nice to have, I just figured it would be heavy duty because of it.

It has Nice sturdy brass fittings (seems like brass to me anyway)

I have plenty of regular 50 ft hoses, but I wanted a 25 ft to keep a small coiled up under the porch for quick access use without having a big coil or to uncoil and deal with 50 ft.  This 25 ft is perfect for this, and it only takes a few twirls to coil it back up.

It's Not totally kink proof though and the 25 ft does kink, but the 25 ft version is Easy to twirl a kink out when it happens.
However, if it was the 50 ft or 75 ft version the kinking would be much greater to deal with and so for some unacceptable (as far as kinking goes)

Otherwise for hot water and or rough duty use this hose is excellent.

I paid $18 for the 25ft with Free S&H fulfilled by Amazon"
4.0,I like this hose and the 25 feet is the perfect length for around my deck area.  Since I have red accents on the deck the hose blends in nicely.
5.0,"Been a year, still great. Been in the sun outside and no cracks or anything, looks and feels almost like the day I bought it. This is a quality water hose, say no to those cheap piece of junk plastic water hose that crack after a few days or weeks."
5.0,This is the best hose that I've ever owned. Durable and no kink - just what you are looking for in a hose.
5.0,It gets the job done! Good durable hose that won't beak on you. This is a must have for a business.
5.0,"No problems with my new Apex 25' garden hose.  I use it as a supply line for my chicken coop, buried approximately 4"" beneath the soil / surface in my backyard. This seems like the right solution for me and one that I'll be able to rely on for years to come.  The nozzle and receptacle are well made and strong.  A support is provided at the end that connects to my spigot to help in installing the hose and to brace & reinforce the connection."
5.0,"Works like it should, as advertised and I have no complaints.  Item was received in good condition as described, perfect."
5.0,"THE DESERT IS VERY CHALLANGING ON WATER HOSES HERE IN THE DESERT  AND MOST OF THE VINYL OR SQUIRRLEY HOSES ON THE MARKET DO NOT SURVIVE THE 115 DEGREE HEAT HERE IN THE SONORA DESERT.

THE APEX INDUSTRIAL RUBBER HOSE IS RATED TO WITHSTAND 180 DEGREE TEMPERATURES VERY EASILY.

THE APEX DOES NOT GET TANGELLED UP IN KNOTS AND IS VERY FLEXIBLE TO HANDLE IN ALL CATEGORIES."
5.0,This is a remarkably strong hose. I was impressed by the fact it was rated for hot water. I will use it to connect water to my camper and won't worry about the sun heating the hose and the water pressure blowing the hose up.
4.0,"It works fine, but my rough estimate of distance was a bit off. So while the hose seems great, I'd carefully check what kind of distance you need to cover before buying it."
5.0,"Why did I pick this hose ? It could handle hot water and cold
I use it in the garage to clean the floor
I evry happy with it and if you want a great hose order it here"
5.0,"Great product at a great price.  Too early to tell the product integrity, but so far so good. Looks duable."
5.0,I bought this hose to periodically empty the hot water heater.  My plumber recommended i do this every 6 months to ensure water heater lasts longer.  IDK im not a plumber.  Hose holds up just fine.
3.0,"I should have followed my gut and not been lazy, instead I ordered this kinky (no joke intended) hose. Had I just gone to Home Depot I could have bought the same quality for $10 less, or a better quality hose for the same price. My bad."
4.0,"I purchased the 50-foot version of this hose. I've only had it for a couple of weeks but so far I love it. It hasn't kinked once, handles higher water pressure than most green hoses, and the fittings are very high quality.
I immediately replaced the plastic washers with high quality rubber versions, just in anticipation of leaks and spurting not because there was anything wrong with the stock plastic washers.
One downside is the weight of the hose, especially with water running through it. Being a young-man, it doesn't bother me but I have a 3 year old that is small for his age. He likes to help me water the garden and play with the hose when I'm washing the car so we'll see how this works out for him but I may have to get a lighter hose (which seems to be a positive problem from my perspective)."
5.0,"I needed a short water hose that was for hot water.  Found it, love it!  I don't know how durable it will be, because it is dragged over concrete floors all the time."
5.0,"Doesn't kink and is thick and rugged, holding up nicely outside. I would buy another one for the front yard."
4.0,"Used the hose to extend washer connections in a garage.  Probably not to plumbing code, but it did the trick!  Good quality, heavy duty, hot water rated."
3.0,"It's a nice hose for the money, but when I was hooking it up it seemed soft and I hadn't even run hot water through it yet. Seems that it might kink easely."
5.0,"my wife was injured at work and the only thing she was able to do was go out and water her garden but was not able to turn water on and off so we just left the cheep Walmart hose's on they kept bursting and breaking and kinking.

This hose does none of that. no waking up to having a geyser in the yard. No having to get up and unkink it for my wife. It works perfectly! it doesn't break and it doesn't look half bad!

Great product, Great price!"
1.0,"ALL GOOD, USE IT EVERYDAY FOR INSDUSTRIAL WASHING  OF MEAT PLANT IN USDA  CFIA  APPROVED  FEDRAL PLANT
LOOKING FORWARD TO  LONG LIFE CYCLE

i tried to e mail the company back dec 6 th , did  not  even get  a reply since
buyer beware!
life cycle was 2 months compared to  previous one we had for 3 yrs,
wall thickness and reinforcement is dismal compared to old model we had
again

 you get  what you pay for"
4.0,Would give a 5 star but my handle slips thru the top of the auger. Other than that definitely a must if u need to dig some holes for post or poles!!
5.0,Great product till you hit a larger rock.  Then the claw model would be better.
4.0,saved the pounding on my shoulder the turning motion of the auger it a lot easer to dig 2 foot holds
5.0,"I normally would not give 5 stars for any product, but this auger works great!  I will be digging a hole for the base of my ham radio vertical antenna, but I won't do that until I get to my new residence.  I have to go down 4 feet to anchor the 1"" diameter pipe for which my antenna will me mounted to at ground level.  I have enough room in the hole to pour cement to secure the mounting pipe.

I ordered this auger from Amazon a couple of weeks ago and received it in 2 days later.  I used it just today to drill a practice hole to test the ease of use of this tool.  I went down 3 and a half feet with it with hardly any effort.  (The only hangup is that I will need to go 4 feet down with it, but it only goes down 3 and a half feet...that ok because I have a ""ditch digging tool to go the extra half foot)....I am a 70 year old with a bad back and other health issues resulting from war.  The practice hole I made with this auger was just perfect and so easy to make.  I would give this auger 10 stars if I was allowed for the ease of use and the job it does, especially for an old guy like me.  We will be using it for other projects also.  It is very durable and long handles to make it easy.  You don't have to put hardly any pressure down on the auger to dig. Just aim and twist with ease!  It is worth every penny of the $70 price tag for it!"
5.0,Very pleased with my new auger. I have difficulty using a regular shovel and with the auger all I need to do is turn the arms of the auger and as the soil is loosened the fixed clam-shell blades fill up then I lift auger out of hole dump dirt to one side then repeat till I get  to the depth I need.
5.0,"Tpost puller is rugged in design and works well, just as stated. Recommend highly."
5.0,Works as advertised!
5.0,Works perfectly for a shallow well. The 6 inch is the right size. Watch YouTube videos on how to drill the well. I want about 20 feet and have plenty of water. So I bought at the local hardware store the pipe to extend my handle.
5.0,"Great, I did get down until 18 feet .... and more soon ..."
3.0,"This seems a great tool for digging post holes.  I will try it out next weekend.

It looks great, except for the handle.  The handle on mine was dented, scraped and chipped....  Now it has many splinters.  :(  See attached photo.
 I got a splinter in my finger while installing the handle.

This was NOT shipping damage.  The box was undamaged.  And the plastic/bubble wrap around the item was also undamaged.

I suppose I will fix this by sanding it down and then re-sealing it.  This does not impair the functionality of this tool."
5.0,"I don't know about anyone else but I am happy about this hose. I am in my sixties and feel the amount of lead in making this product is no big deal. You get most of all your food & outdoor products from China, most all people seem to buy them without question. It is a hose and not a food container. Look, I have had my hose for 4 years and water stays on all the time. I can grab the hose and turn on my fire-hose type nozzle and water what ever. Does it kink, the answer is yes. The good thing is, the hose seems to never break down. Take your time and unroll the hose and make it straight and you won't have much problem. Other hose's once they kink they seem to fail at that point, but not this hose. Take your pick, the industrial hose or the typical green hose. I'll take the Red hose. Have fun with your pick. Mr. T"
3.0,"This is a nice heavy duty hose. I read the other reviews about kinking. I find that if I coil the hose on the ground, when I drag it to an area to water, it will kink almost every time. I am wondering if this will get better when it gets used more. It is so stiff. it is actually hard to coil. I have only had it two weeks and i am thankful for a new hose, but if you want something that absolutely does not kink the minute you unwind it, don't purchase this one."
5.0,"Bought so that I could cut-to-size a hot water hose for a washing machine installation.  Probably could have selected a cheaper hose since the hot water is really not that hot as it circulates thru the hose.  Still, even at a premium price, a very reliable hose."
2.0,"I talked my boss into buying this hose, because it was rated for hot water usage. Well, the hose worked great right out of the box, and I thought all our hot water hose woes were behind us. This particular hose lasted us a grand total of two weeks +/- a day or two.

I work in a restaurant setting, so we need a hose that can handle hot water... very hot water. I still haven't found one that can hold up, though this one was one of the best. Any hose that relies on glue to keep things together should not be rated for hot water usage, plain and simple. Eventually, the seal will melt and things will get very wet in places where it shouldn't!

Back to the ol' drawing board...!"
4.0,"This is an excellent hose packing a lot of bang for your buck.

PROS:

1. It is a 5-ply 5/8"" commercial grade red hose rated to 180 Degrees F.
2. It has a 4 inch black collar to help prevent kinks.
3. Brass couplings compared to nickel-plated couplings of many competitors-e.g.(Swan)
4. Considerably cheaper than other similar-rated hoses.
5. Mates perfectly with the Gilmour 572TFR Insulated Grip Spray Nozzle.

CONS:

1. I would have liked to see metal tension springs placed on both ends of the hose to prevent kinks rather than one 4"" plastic collar.

I use this hose to drain residential hot water tanks.  Easy to use and works perfectly.

Suggestion:

Remember to spray a bit of silicone or WD-40 on the brass couplings occasionally."
4.0,"She said the hose kinked the first time she tried to use it. Perhaps that was more likely because I coiled it the opposite direction from how it was coiled in the package. We changed and coiled it the same way it had been, but in large circles. That helped a lot. After several weeks, it is now much better. It seems to be good quality."
1.0,"This hose promised to be commercial grade and never have a problem with kinking. It is a nightmare. It kinks constantly, in numerous places. We are disappointed to have paid extra to have a product perform so poorly. If it weren't so difficult to mail back, we would not have kept this item. The only thing heavy-duty about this hose is the weight."
2.0,"We used this to run from an outdoor hot water heater to a tub.  Multiple normal (not hot water) hoses had failed, but this worked great.  Recommended.

2/2013 update: the hose did not hold up, the walls became very flimsy and the hose kinks easily.  Not recommended after all...

If anyone has experience with a good quality hot water hose that can stand up to outdoor hot water use, please comment..."
5.0,"I cannot stand hoses that kink up and this hose is very kink resistant.  It is left outside in all 4 seasons and has had no problems in the entire year I have owned it.  Two big thumbs up! Very, very durable."
5.0,"An outstanding hose. I bought it primarily because I can't stand kinks and this hose, while not entirely kink free, is far superior than most other hoses I have used!"
1.0,if you have roots or rocks or both don't waste your money
5.0,Works great
5.0,Excellent Tool for digging deep. I extended this tool by using rigid conduit and dug to 10 feet. You for sure can go deeper.
4.0,"Used to put in fence posts. Works great on regular soil. It does not do roots, strays off course if it runs into one and does not cut them. January 2018 in NC, ground is frozen, it doesn't do frozen ground. Have to use the standard post hole digger. In any case, keep the regular post hole digger close by. I do plan to use this to dig a well. We'll see how it does."
4.0,"It works, and quality is good, but I haven't used it enough to fully rate it yet.  I will say that if you take a few minutes with a file and sharpen the edges up a bit, it becomes notably easier to use.  This seems true with most any new outdoor tool.  I suppose they don't want to ship it overly sharp for fear of damage to the edge or possibly injuring someone."
5.0,works great
5.0,"Well this gem really works as well as other reviewers have stated. I will say it is best used in combination with a post hole digger. This auger works to rapidly make a hole, however the clamshell action of a post hole type digger will allow you to easily clean up the sides of the hole as well as remove dirt debris from the bottom of the hole. I was able to make eight post holes 30"" deep for 4 x 6 inch posts in approximately 6 hours in California hard pan dirt. Note this auger will not work in very rocky soil as it gets hung up on rocks and on tree roots, both of which I was able to address with the post hole digger and then continue augering. Also as noted by others, the hole actually comes out 7-8 inches in diameter, perfect for a 4 x 4 post. Combining this auger with the fence post digger allowed me to easily enlarge the hole for my 4 x 6 inch posts. I am very glad I purchased this auger for my retaining wall project, it saved me a tremendous amount of back work on the post holes."
5.0,Works better than the other post hole digger that you have smash into the ground over and over again. My soil is mostly clay and it makes digging holes a breeze. It get get caught up on rocks but I just use the other post hole digger to fetch out the rock then go back to the Seymour auger. Worth the money saves your back!
4.0,good
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with price and quality.
5.0,Couldnt believe how easy it was to dig a post hole with this thing. What an awesome tool.
5.0,very well made and easy to use
5.0,"I received it well packaged and used it without any issues. It is well made, and a great buy for the money."
5.0,THIS POST HOLE DIGGER DID THE JOB WHEN INSTALLING MAIL BOX POST. EASY TO USE NOW IT IS BEING LOANED OUT TO A FRIEND TO USE.
5.0,Bought this for my son and he is very happy with it.  Went down 9ft and 14ft (with black pipe extensions) with really no trouble. He even had my 8 and 5 y\o grand kids using it.  Very good tool.
5.0,Makes holes FAST!
5.0,"Digging postholes are always difficult, but not with one of these. The holes don't dig themselves, but they're so much easier that you almost enjoy it. I start the hole with a regular posthole digger, place this in the started hole, apply a little pressure, turn this like a drill, and it just works it's way right down. You can dig an 18"" to 24""  hole in red clay in a matter of minutes. Wish I had bought one of these years ago."
5.0,"This is such a great improvement over the back breaking post hole diggers I was using.  At my age (72) I was looking for an easier way to dig through some hard caliche clay to set some landscape posts. Well made and sturdy with a large enough handle to maneuver with little effort.
It's a great buy!"
5.0,This auger is one of the best tools we have. Makes digging post holes a snap. One drawback if you have rocks in you soil it can be challenging to remove rocks bigger than a golf ball which any larger you need to gig rocks by hand of using a small spade from the hole. This tool can also be used to dig shallow wells.
5.0,"Awesome post hole digger.  Much easier than clam shell type post hole digger, especially the deeper you go, when a clam shell type's handles begin to hit the top of the hole.  Holds onto the material in the auger as you lift it out very well."
4.0,This item was not that impressive looking when I first took it out of the box but like many reviews have stated it really works.  I have hard sun-baked Southern Clay soil and I had spent hours trying to dig post holes with the traditional post hole digger.  Too much effort and back strain required from that tool.  This baby however digs right through the soil just be twisting the handle.  Much easier!  The only concern I have is that there seems to be a slight bending of the top of the auger from the shovel part and I'm not sure that's normal.  I'll follow-up if problems develop.
3.0,"The quality of the tool is good but it did not provide any advantage over a clam shell type digger for me.  My project was setting two 4""x4"" gate posts and I struggled with my clam shell tool to get down to 2 feet.  Wanted to go to 3 feet and spent and agonizing time using this tool, my clam shell diggers, and a hammer a steel stake to make it about another 8 inches before the ""good"" enough exhaustion light went off and I declared the project done.

I don't know what type of sedentary type layer I was hitting, maybe sandstone, maybe shale, but I really needed a steel digging to more quickly punch through the layer.  However, I had already spent enough $$$ on this project and couldn't bear to buy another tool.

I would imagine that for this tool is better than other diggers for certain soil conditions.  However for my hard packed clay/whatever this was no better than my other tools."
5.0,This is the best manual post hole digger that I have ever used.
5.0,Goes through gravelly sand and clay with a lot less effort than with a spoon type.
5.0,Best way to dig holes even in water.  Easy to add extension pipes available at Lowes.
5.0,"I don't normally write reviews but I have to on this purchase. I bought this based on the reviews I read and they were spot on. Dug 29 post holes with perfect depth in Midwest soil. Only thing that slows it down is rocks larger than 1"" in diameter, if digging through backfill it might walk a little bit, but other than that it's the best post hole tool I have ever used. I have installed countless posts and this is by far my most prized tool in the arsenal now. Built tough as nails, something you can abuse and expect the same result each time. Seymour got this one spot on."
5.0,It worked very well
5.0,only way to dig a hole for posts in my opinion... much easier than post hole diggers and shovels.  works great!
4.0,Fast service. Item s perfect for one-man post-hole digging.  One small criticism is that the small locating screw provided is made from material so insubstantial that it did not survive the first hole dug - switch it for a more substantial location screw and all is fine.
5.0,Works better than expected.
1.0,"I find it  extremely annoying that some guy thought it wise to slam a giant staple in the end of this otherwise beautiful shovel handle. This means the consumer  paying for the shovel handle must fight to remove the staple and then sand down the burs created by  prying the metal loose that was shot into the fiberglass.  The staple must be removed or it will surely interfere with the  intended use of this product. I have purchased many products from Amazon over the years and none of them arrived damaged in this way. If the  manufacturer or other handlers are intent on continuing this practice, then in all fairness, the handle should be displayed at the Amazon website with the giant staple stuck in the  top of it for accuracy as the staple becomes part of the handle and removing it renders the handle damaged goods."
5.0,"Excellent quality! This is the strongest shovel handle that I've ever owned. I'm pretty sure that my high quality shovel would break before this handle would. The hole for the rivet didn't line up with the hole in my particular shovel, (I probably have an oddball shovel), so I drilled a new hole in the handle. It drilled hard and dulled the bit but it was so worth it to finally have a shovel that I can depend on it's handle to not break in the middle of a job. The handle fits nice and tight as well and it has a real nice feel to it. I highly recommend this handle."
4.0,"I used a belt sander to shape the end of the handle so it would fit into my shovel head.  The handle is not a stiff as a wooden handle, but hopefully it will last much longer than the previous two wooden handles that broke.

I'd give this handle five stars if it was steel-reinforced and about 6 inches longer."
5.0,"48"" of solid fiberglass how can you go wrong ..just wish they pulled the staple out before they shipped it"
5.0,Great idea
4.0,"Used to create starter holes to 12"" deep for planting 50 succulents in heavy clay soil. Excellent job for the first 6 inch width.  Used a spade shovel to finish widening the holes.  Did not work in heavily rooted areas as others have noted.  Minor roots to 1/2"" were usually handled.  Handle was poorly finished and needed to be sanded prior to use to avoid splinters in my hands.  Pricey, but did save time and it worked different muscles than the shovel.  Much better than a clam type post hole digger for my hard clay.  Glad I purchased it."
5.0,"I did my research before digging holes to secure our new arbor into 2-foot deep holes. The old clam-shell digger? Please... WAY too much work for a hole that is either not very deep OR too wide. (I wanted a hole just big enough to seat the 4 x 4s that extended into the legs of the Arbor.) An mechanized auger? Well, great, if you have one, but expensive and a lot of trouble to rent.

I found out my ground is rockier than I expect, which made my work harder than it would have been without the rocks, but still this made steady progress and every stroke that didn't hit a large rock took up 4-6 inches of dirt and I had 2 feet deep holes in an hour of work, even digging around a wheel-barrow full of potato-sized rocks."
5.0,Amazing product. Works so easily with mininal effort.
5.0,Worked great
3.0,"It's a bit basic for the cost, but works well. The included screw to set the handle broke in half from simple hand tightening, and the wooden handle doesn't sit perfectly in the middle. I've dug five 25' wells with it and it's been laying in the rain since day one, and is still in perfect shape."
5.0,"I love this! It beats the clam shell digger for speed, although I do us both. Very please. Now I want another! I intend on putting on an extension for deeper holes."
5.0,"Cuts right in, much better than traditional clam-shell post hole diggers."
5.0,"Used this in sandy to clay soil.  Does not like sand very much but you can put water in hole to make it muddy and it will pick that up.  Digs pretty, straight, deep holes.  I am using it to dig a fence line and have dung down to 3 feet with it.  Getting that low with this will give you an abdominal workout, but it is no worse than using clam-shell diggers."
4.0,"I bought this to install a mailbox post and for future use in putting in fence posts and planting larger plants.

It made VERY quick work in digging the hole for the post. My only complaint is regarding the handle. It is a wooden dowel, essentially, that is loose in the shaft hole and held on by a screw that broke during my one post install. I replaced the screw with another one with a random spare, but that broke, too. Truthfully you don't really need the handle to be on tight, but the difference between the dowel diameter and the shaft mount's inner diameter is a good 1/8-1/4"". Since the axis of the force applied when using the auger is rotational it's not a huge deal when using the tool, but it is mildly annoying and it could result in you losing the handle of its not screwed on."
4.0,This thing is great if you have no rocks or just small rocks. I have very heavy red clay and almost no rock.  I can dig a 2 foot hole and set a post in 20 minutes and there is no impact using it so fatigue isn't that big of a deal.
4.0,I've been looking for an auger for ages - this one appears to be just the ticket for light work
5.0,"I was a little skeptical of this but the reviews were positive so I thought I'd take a chance. I had a bunch of fence posts to put in and the regular post hole digger I have combined with Georgia clay was not working well.

Wife and I started using it to put in a few posts and wow I'm a convert. It's totally worth the money. I was able to put the posts at least two feet deeper, MUCH easier, than with the regular digger. It's easy enough to use that my wife, with little upper body strength, was able to dig a few holes quite easily. It drastically shortened the time and effort to put in the 10 fence posts we needed, with much less sweat and tears.

It does choke on rocks so keep a trowel or the regular post hole digger handy. One other benefit is that it really chewed up the dirt from the hole pretty fine so when it came time to fill the hole back in around the post it was much easier to distribute it around the post instead of the big clumps you get with a regular digger. We didn't run into any roots where we were putting the posts so I'm not sure how it would handle those, but I assume the same would apply."
5.0,"Worked so much better than the ""tweezer"" type post hole diggger I used before buying this one. This auger easily cut through my rocky, root infested soil."
5.0,all ok
5.0,Product was delivered before date stated on order. It is very well made and worked as expected. I have extremely hard clay soil and it dug right through it. Very satisfied.
5.0,"What a wonderful tool! I had to dig 21 holes 3-1/2 to 4 feet deep for an 8' fence and it was a cake walk! I bought 2 black steel pipe nipples 3/4"" NPT x 10"" and 2 couplings at the hardware store to make the handle longer. You may or may not need to do that depending on your needs. The property is Kansas black dirt that is packed like concrete... literally, a truck leaves no tracks or ruts! I had to remove the sod off the top with a spade and occasionally cut some big roots with a very sharp skinny spade but otherwise this thing chews it's way easily. It turns easily and partly pulls itself down... about 4 or 5 turns and it is full. I lift it out and then knocked it on the side of a wheel barrow so there was no mess on the lawn. I did not even work up a blister!"
5.0,Incredible tool. Works great and dug two foot post holes no problem through rocky sandy ground.
5.0,"Great for post holes! I dug 12 post holes in about half the time it normally takes me. It's no good at getting through thick roots though, we had to use old faithful (the traditional one) for that. Also a few terminal posts needed to be 36 in deep. This auger could do it but I was almost in a full squat by the end or I would have killed my back (the handle isn't long enough for three ft holes comfortably).  Perfect for 24 in deep!"
2.0,"Used it twice and it doesn't work very well. We have matted grass/weeds and it didn't get more than 2-3"" down with lots of pressure. Our post-hole digger works MUCH better than this! I'll probably give it another shot, but am not happy with it at this point."
4.0,"Works great. Much less effort than standard post hole diggers. Black pipe extensions are cheap. The handle fits a little loose and it struggles to cut through certain materials. Overall, very satisfied."
5.0,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made, we ( I had help) used it to bore out of my basement  (horizontally) so I could run underground water and electric to our garage.  It is manual and does require some sweat equity but it is a well built tool simple to use, and bored a perfect tunnel app. 14' out under my deck where I could continue with a trench. Saved a lot of money and stress!"
5.0,"Bought this auger to try and dig a shallow well, adding 3/4"" pipe as I needed. went down 12 ' in about an hour and then hit river rock. It's taken me about 3 hours to go another foot but still going! Just need another 5 or 6 '."
5.0,This Auger makes digging post holes soooooo easy!  Highly reccomend it.
1.0,Worked excellent at first.  Than within a very short time (couple of weeks) the small fastener that holds the two ends together broke.  Became useless after that.  Been sitting in my garage ever since!
5.0,"Great tool , much easier than clamps"
5.0,this will do the job much easier than a post hole digger
5.0,"It seems on a little farm there is constant need to build or move a fence.  Not everyone can afford a farm tractor and power equipment or justify the purchase.  In steps this human powered auger.  After many complaints of the clam-shell type auger and many sore backs/hips, I found this for sale on Amazon.  My son is a happy learning to be farmer!"
4.0,"This was a replacement for one I had around dating from the 40's.  Much easier to use on the clay/sandy soil I have here than the traditional clam shell digger.  With the later I have to use a breaker bar to break the dirt before its dug out.  With the auger its just push, twist and lift out the dirt.  Very good for small hard to get to places."
5.0,exactly what i needed
5.0,"For the price, you really can't beat it. I though of renting a fuel powered auger for $80 or buying one of these. I used the automatic auger before and they are difficult to use for just 1 person, so I opted to try one. I have a lot of tall pin oak trees in my back yard, and it is mostly clay. This tore through small roots and pulled up the clay like bricks. I am in decent shape so I didn't have a problem. If you hit a moderate root then cut it with a post hole digger and then continue."
5.0,Works really well. When you hit a rock or something you are going to need a slate bar to get it out. Otherwise just turn and burn this thing makes holes all day
5.0,"My favorite purchase from amazon (so far). Works extremely well, couldn't be happier!"
5.0,"The Seymour auger is on one word - FABULOUS. A section of our split rail fence collapsed with three in a row rotted out posts. I didn't feel like hiring someone, so following a lot of reviews and research I bought the Seymour Auger. I am 61 years old, and had no problem digging two and a half foot post holes. It plowed through rotted posts, clay and stones with absolutely no problem. It's easy to attach the handle and off you go. I have one more inline gate post to do. Looking forward to it. If you have to do it, add a small sledge hammer, a tape measure and a reciprocal battery operated saw and you are in business."
4.0,"Have only used it on 8 holes to plant small trees.  It seems to work well at least until it hits the clay strata....  It does eliminate the shoulders jarring that comes with the two-handled post hole digger.  Well built, sturdy tool.  Nice supplement to the shovel and two-handled post hole."
5.0,Works great
3.0,Works as expected.
5.0,"Excellent product, exactly what I had looked for."
5.0,"I recently used this to dig a drainage hole for one of my downspouts.  I started with a traditional two handed post hole digger and switched over to this.  The soil was a sand/clay mix which was a pain with the traditional digger.  This product quickly and easily ripped out the soil no problems.  Even my 6yro son could twist it, although I still had to pull the soil.  Only negative is that it can be more difficult to get the dirt out of the auger, the positive is that the dirt is more contained than with a typical digger.

I can see why people buy these to bore down deep, even it is a very slow job."
5.0,"I used the auger to dig 18 post holes 30"" deep for 100 feet of wooden fence.  I was think of renting a powered auger but decided to take a chance on this tool.  It works great!  Our Midwestern soil is a clay mix but his auger just plowed right through it.  I was impressed with the speed and ease that I was able to dig the holes.  Very, very happy and impressed."
4.0,"Well, it's no 10 minutes to dig a hole, let me just say! I have very rock soil but in about an hour, I had 8"" dug--enough to plant my lilac bush--which is doing very well, thank you! But make no mistake, this is hard work! It does eventually dig but my goodness, be prepared to be sore the next day!"
5.0,"I work for Mastec as a satellite TV installer, this far surpass the standard clam she'll post hole digger. This will cut your time in 1/2 or more!"
5.0,this is a great tool that made making holes for posts so much easier. I love it.
5.0,"So easy to use. We have installed a lot of fence posts, and this works very well, even in rocky soil."
5.0,"Works great, easy to use"
5.0,Great Tool.
5.0,Received promptly.  Item exactly as represented.  Have used it several times to dig post holes...WHAT A TIME AND BACK SAVER this tool is!  Even my petite wife can use it and dig holes where post hole diggers just cannot do the job.  :D
5.0,well built.  will be the only one that I ever need to buy.
5.0,BEST POST HOLE DIGGER YOU CAN GET
5.0,"I have used a clam-shell post hole digger most of my life, and i didn't know this tool existed. OMG! So much easier to dig a fence-post hole. It works like a corkscrew or a drill bit. Just press on it and crank it around. Works in clay and handles small roots up to 1/2"" or so. I had trouble with some rocks in a couple holes, but who doesn't?  Great uniform 6"" holes!"
5.0,This is the most amazing tool find I have ever had.  Get one.  Now.
5.0,"Wish I'd purchased one of these sooner.  So much better than the traditional two-sided ""scoop"" post-hole digger your find in your average department store."
5.0,"Gonna dig some wells, twenty plus feet down."
5.0,Digging in hard clay. Other methods failed. The auger made the project possible.
5.0,"This is spectacular!  I used to have one of these many years ago and I wasn't aware they still made them.  I like it so much, I will probably buy the 8"" one shortly.
The soil where I live is full of roots and rocks and this does a really good job with them.  If the roots or rocks are large, they will still have to be chopped out with a shovel or something, but this cuts right through small roots (less than 1/2"") and dislodges rocks that are smaller than golf ball size."
5.0,Works great!
4.0,Nice quality-price.
5.0,"I bought this for my husband because we were building a patio cover and needed to dig some holes for the posts. We have the traditional post hole digger but he has a heart condition and we have hard to dig clay soil and using the traditional one he was only able to dig a couple of holes a day. When we got this we went outside and went to work finishing digging the post holes. It was so fast and easy I was amazed. He dug 6 holes 3 feet deep in less than 30 minutes. We had all 8 posts set in concrete in just under 2 hours. But this isn't just for digging post holes we have used it to plant shrubs and trees as well. Its easy to use light weight, but very sturdy and although your arm muscles may be a little sore afterward it is easy on your back. I highly recommend this auger."
5.0,Best post hole digger ever.  Works so much better than those pincher kind.
4.0,Great product. Well made.  The wooden t handle was very rough and rewuired sanding to usr without gloves.
5.0,was what I expected  no suprises
5.0,It digs much faster than the standard clamshell type posthole digger.
5.0,hard to find but this style works better than the other style
5.0,What a wonderful tool!!  Used this to drill a water well.  Cut through hard clay with ease.  The handle is removable so I was able to add galvanized pipe extensions to it to get 20' deep with it.  Very well made!
5.0,"Great tool. Cut through clay to 45"" easily. Would be nice if tool was 6"" longer for full 48"" hole."
5.0,great
5.0,Just what I was looking for. It will do the job. Good quality.
5.0,I am a 63 year old woman and I have no problem using this anger.
4.0,I like the hole Auger.  The only problem is the handle.  I cant get it centered.......started hammering it in and it won't go any further. Now its stuck.  Wont go in or out.  The end of the handle started to crack as I was pounding so hard. I need a new handle and I haven't use it yet.
5.0,"I would definitely recommend using this post hole auger.  Very well constructed and cuts quickly down into the ground.  Easy to use.  This item is so well constructed, I believe my son and his kids will be able to use it.  Awesome."
5.0,So glad I tried this. Much easier and faster then using a post hole digger. My neighbors want to borrow it
5.0,Just what I wanted and expected.
5.0,My son was skeptical about this tool......until he used it to put in 20 fenceposts. Now he is a believer!
5.0,Love it did what I expected to do
5.0,Not sue I will use my clam shell digger every again!
5.0,Had auger of this configuration in 1956.  It worked well.  Gave Seymour a try.  Same design--same excellent performance.
4.0,"Great digging tool. 4 stars because I had too use traditional post hole diggers to break the soil. This would not drill down straight without removing a few inches of grass. Once digging it was much faster that traditional diggers with less effort.

Dug through hard packed wet and dry clay, dirt, sand and rocky soil. Struggles a bit with large rocks in the hole. Don't toss your old diggers and keep them handy when using this. A combination of both when digging is ideal"
4.0,"It's not exactly magic,and still takes some upper body strength,  but at 65 I AM able to dig wide enough and deep enough planting holes for  tree seedlings in hard clay-and-gravel soil with this auger, which is something I could not do with my very expensive all steel shove that claimed to do the same."
5.0,This is an awesome tool.  Very easy to use and highly effective.  I am not particularly big or strong and I was able to dig a 3 foot hole in a matter of minutes.  I am thinking about building a fence now since i have such an effective tool.
1.0,"I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.  It did not work in clay soil or with even the smallest roots.  Figuring it might be that I don't have enough upper body strength I had a friend who is a landscaper try it and he quickly agreed it didn't do a good job.  It would work in loose dirt, but not hard dirt with clay or marl as we have in my area.  He brought his regular two handled version of a post hole digger and had me try it.  Soooo much better.  It not only dug easier it pulled the dirt out much more thoroughly as well.  I'm just disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try it 'til I'd hit the thirty days.  If this was 5 days ago I would have readily returned it.  If you can try various options from friends, neighbors or family I strongly advise you do that.  Conceptually this one may be good, but the results terrible."
5.0,Cuts through like butter!
5.0,"These auger type post hole diggers are fantastic. Easier to use than the clamp end type. A lot tougher than the clamp end type, as well. This digger has worked very well for me so far. It is rugged and reliable. It is perfect for my needs where I only have to dig a few holes a year."
5.0,"This is a spectacular gardening tool. I augered nearly 100 holes to plant large potted plants. It easily went through dirt, clay and some small stones. After the gardening is complete I will be using it for fence post holes. This tool is well built, very sturdy and easy to use. I highly recommend it to homeowners and contractors alike."
4.0,"This tool arrived in a rough looking box, barely held closed with tape, but the product is tough/durable, and was in fine shape.  This digger works, but only if it's not going through rocky soil. Even smallish rocks will stop the auger, they have to be removed some other way, before the auger will go deeper. I like this tool, especially if you need to dig a hole near burried utilities, because you can go slow and easy."
5.0,Borrowed one of these years ago and thought it was great.  Decided to buy my own this time.  Dug a 2 foot deep hole in hard Indiana clay in a matter of minutes.  Excellent tool.
4.0,a nice & unique product to advance productivity as it exstracts the dirt when removing the
5.0,Great post hole digger. Just turn and it digs into the ground.  Checked you tube before ordering and it performed as advertised. Planted ten rose bushes in about one hour with plenty of rest. digging in clay in Colorado.
5.0,"Met All Expectations.
Looking Forward To Buying Other Sizes.
Thanks."
3.0,"The wood grain on the included wooden handle was horribly torn out. I remember thinking when I first opened that package that it is a splinter waiting to happen. Lo and behold, within 5 minutes of using the auger for the first time I got a nasty splinter from the handle! I'll be using a piece of metal pipe in place of the wood in the future, because the wood is so damaged I don't think even several heavy coats of varnish will seal up the torn grain enough to protect from splinters.

The auger itself works fine, and I'd definitely use it over post hole diggers. As others have noted, it struggles in rocky soil and around large tree roots, but in soft soil it works fine. It seemed to work fine out of the box but I'll be sure to keep a metal file around to sharpen the blades in case it gets pinged by any rocks. Augers of this design are especially nice because you can use 3/4 inch threaded pipe as an extension on the stock handle; I've even dug a water well with one before. If you are intending to dig a water well with one though, keep in mind that when you hit saturated soil it becomes very difficult to remove the auger in time before the mud/sand drips back into the hole, so there is a limit to the depth that you can reach.

All in all it is a useful tool to have around. Like I said before though, the wooden handle is useless and speaks of poor quality control, and if others arrive in similar condition to mine, you WILL hurt yourself by using it. If you don't mind turning your own replacement handle on a lathe or using a piece of metal pipe in its place, then you will be just fine."
5.0,"Fast delivery, auger works really well ( using it with little kids, and they could do it!)"
4.0,Does the job.
5.0,"great shovel to have, even drills holes in sand stone if you don't mind sharpening it after wards"
5.0,"Item was exactly what we were looking for.  Very quick delivery, and item arrived exactly as described.  Would definitely order from this company again!"
5.0,"It works great. Too bad I didn't buy this years ago.

It's quick and easy and many times better than a conventional post hole digger."
5.0,"I tried all kinds of methods I read about on the Internet to dig post holes, all were slow and backbreaking. I didn't know this tool existed until I searched for ""post hole"" on Amazon. It works great! It took only 10 minutes to dig a 21 inch hole!"
5.0,I just came in from using this post hole digger. I LOVE IT. I am in a wheelchair and was still able to dig the holes in needed.
5.0,exactly what I needed
5.0,excellent. I could not have dug the post holes with the conventional post hole digger in my sloped area with roots and rocks. I did use my hand saw to clear out the larger roots. & I did revert  to the old hole digger when I wanted to jam out some rocks. I also used a trench shovel to break lose some rocks out of reach and then pulled out the rocks with the old hole digger. It worked for this little old gray haired lady. What was particularly nice is that you can slow down or work a bit easier with this auger when you get tired.  The old way is either a constant strain or not getting the job done.
5.0,"Wow. Wasn't sure about it at first but using it sold it, great product better than regular post hole diggers."
4.0,Used it for the 1st time to dig a 36 inch hole.  Worked well through the hard clay.
5.0,"This thing is amazing for planting 4x4 posts! I did 4 holes in 10 minutes, with very little adjustments needed to the hole. Love it."
5.0,works as advertised.
5.0,Works much better than the 2 handle type hole diggers. Went through sandy hard compacted clay easily. I have both type diggers. The two handled lever one would only penetrate a couple inches of clay even with a lot of downforce. So this one saves time. Good for 4 inch posts but sides may need shaving for 6 inch posts. I only use my two handled one now for cleaning up the hole and removing loose dirt.
5.0,Really enjoying the ease of use.  Looking forward to fence repair this summer now that I have this auger.
5.0,"Ok, this tool easily did the job.  Well worth the money!"
5.0,Got it afternoon about 2pm;Got it to hand dig shallow well in Alabama with ft and a half of clay;Already brought 5 lengths of 4ft threaded gas pipe and couplings;Have dug aprox 12 ft in an hour;Am 66 yrs and my back an legs are killing me tonight;have already rigged some 4x4s and 2by4s for pulling it out of hole with my chain falls;Have hit water at 9ft;Am going to continue to 16 in morning;Expect to be pumping water tomorrow afternoon;Cant beat for digging around here;gonna pump mud out and get it clear with my roller pump attached to power take off on my bigger toy;Tractor an backhoe; Tickled pink;Am drinking bud to quiet my ole ass aches;Great digger
5.0,I loved it
5.0,works even better then I thought it would
5.0,"This guy is amazing! Just twist yourself to a nice post hole. It'll tear through small roots no problem.
Rocks are more of an issue, but no worse than a standard post hole digger."
5.0,Holes dug fast.  Fine dry or wet muddy clay is frustrating.  But most of the year this is the tool of choice and this so much fast than the old clam shell.
5.0,"Used this auger to dig 20+ 18"" deep holes in my back yard and loved it.  I would recommend a good strong pry bar for rocks, but when it has clear dirt it goes through very quickly and easily.  I've used a regular clam-shell post hole digger in the past and didn't think it was as bad as other people were saying, but when I received this I don't think I would go back.  Seems well built and no issues with the last hole compared to the first."
5.0,Much easier than the two handled diggers.
5.0,"I love this style of post hole digger which uses a twisting motion vs just up and down.  I used one like this when I was a kid over forty years ago and loved it.  I am glad that Seymour Mfg still makes a well made model  This is a very professionally mfg. tool and made my fencing job go so much easier.

Kevin"
5.0,"Used this tool to dig the post holes for our vineyard.  Regular diggers would have us out there for 8 hours or more.  We dug all 14 holes in less than 2 hours, including pouring concrete and packing around the posts.  Love this digger."
5.0,"Made short work of the holes I needed to put in a new fence.  Dug easily through layers of different materials; gravel, clay, shubbery roots...

It would be nice if they had a pre-drilled hole to attach the handle, but that is only a minor quibble (I never actually fixed it in place and used the tool just fine)."
5.0,"I bought this for doing 3 fence posts, and then didn't need to do them. But while planting a couple lilac bushes yesterday, I started with a shovel, and that was feeling like it was more work than I felt like doing at the time. Grabbed this post hole digger to see how it did - made digging the holes a breeze, and actually almost fun and I dug too deep. Definitely worth it. I'd even like to see one that digs 8"" diameter holes. I had to dig a hole for my mailbox post a few years ago, and used a clamshell hole digger. That was a lot of work. Wish I had this digger back then."
5.0,Rugged and versatile tool.  Delivered promptly and without damage.
4.0,"I bought this auger to dig shallow well. It is alot faster than a clam shell post hole digger, but, if you hit a single rock you have to start all over. I gave up after the sixth hole and used a backhoe. So, don't even try if the soil is rocky or hard Alabama clay."
5.0,"Marvelously efficient in cooperative soils.  Rocks and serious hardpan require mining methods.b  Barring those,  I couldn't get along without it."
5.0,"This is a great post hole digger. Works easier than the clamshell variety. Just needs downward pressure and turning, much less effort than the other style. This looks like the same tool my Dad had 60 yrs ago. As kids we sat on the crossbrace handle for weight as he turned it. Served two purposes back then!"
5.0,"Just what I needed to dig post holes through clay, stones and roots.  While this will not go through thick roots it does loosen the dirt and stones enough to cut them away or remove them.  A fine product."
5.0,"Well made.  Perfect for digging post holes or holes for pouring deep caissons/footings.  Can add lengths of pipe to extend depth of hole.,"
4.0,"Works very good. The quality of the main components are good. The handle is a bit rough to the point of splintery; I have a very rock soil, and it did a fairly good job of making digging a post hole easier. But, I can imagine this thing will work awesomely in soils that are not very rocky. It did a good job in dislodging rocks up to the size of a large lemon. Make sure to wet the soil so that it can lift the dirt out."
4.0,"This thing is wicked looking. It just sits there on my porch. The neighbors have started looking at me strangely ... as if they're thinking ""what's he burying?"". I haven't used it yet as the ground here in the mountains has already frozen a few times, and I am not as strong as I use to be. So there it sits, on the porch, looking wicked. But I have a gut feeling that it will dig wicked holes ... perhaps there's an oil gusher is in my future (just call me Rockefeller)."
3.0,"It's alright, not the strongest materials as it bent rather easily when I hit some roots. I wouldn't expect it to tear up rocks of thick roots, but I also didn't think it would bend so easily. If you're working in an environment with rather soft soil I'm sure it will do a great job."
5.0,"An amazing tool.  I am 59 years old and walk with a quad cane or walker due to a bad left leg.  I dug a perfect 18-inch deep hole in about five minutes and that's because I was going slowly and cautiously.  No mess at all.  I had a plastic bag next to the hole, the auger held the dirt securely as I pulled it up, and I just shook it out into bag.

One thing:  It comes with a nice 21-inch wood handle that fits nice and tight.  However, I needed to dig the hole within five inches of the fence.  So I got a slightly thinner wood dowel from Home Depot (1-11/16 in. dia.) of the same length that I could pull through, and shorten either side as I came up against the fence when turning it, and used that as the handle.  Worked great.

Seriously, folks.  If you need to dig a post hole, or a well for that matter, this is the tool for you.  Don't waste your time with, and your money, on a pick, spade and clamshell."
5.0,"Fantastic product, my brother in-law had one of these that I borrowed for years. I finally broke down and bought my own. It was a great price and delivery was quick....and free with Prime. Quality made tool. Dug my needed three holes in 30 minutes and had my poles set in 80 minutes start to finish."
5.0,worked great just as I expected
5.0,"This worked better than I expected!
Let me lead off by saying that I used this tool along with a post hole digger. it made digging 15 post holes, 3 feet deep a lot easier.  Neither the Auger nor the post hole digger were the perfect solution for getting the job done, however, together, they really made a difference.  I was digging in kind of sandy soil, with some roots and some rocks.  Roots and rocks are a recipe for disaster regardless of the tool.  Here is what I did.  I started my holes with the post hole digger, this helped get the hole started in the right place.  if you go straight to the auger, it will walk all over until it starts to cut soil.  for me, the top layer of soil had the roots etc, once I made a few inches of progress, I switched to the auger, I was able to dig down 8"" at a time quite quickly if there were no roots or rocks, and getting to a 3 foot depth was much easier with the auger.  When I did encounter issues, I switched back to the post hole digger until it cleared the area.  Had I just used the post hole digger I would have been exhausted in no time.  The auger could cut small roots as well.
I do not want to give anyone false hope that this is a silver bullet and you will fly through post holes likes you had a power auger, but, I can say that you will get better results much faster and with less effort using this tool.  This tool will also work great if you do a lot of planting in the garden or the landscape and makes a nice clean hole."
5.0,"Quite amazing product.  I added 3/4"" pipe extentions and bored an irrigation water well by my garden.........got to 21 feet down then the rock stopped me cold."
5.0,Awesome piece of equipment!
5.0,"I dug 22 holes in 3 days with this. It worked WAY better than the stab and spread post hole digger that couldn't get me a clean and neat 3 1/2 foot hole without having to dig the sides of the walls to accommodate the spreading action. The only trouble I had was with roots over 1 inch in diameter or an occasional rock, but it ate up most anything else and those issues were to be expected. You need a good bar to cut the roots and dislodge some rocks, but otherwise this thing is amazing!"
5.0,Was not sure if this was going to do the trick but has worked out way better than i expected.
5.0,"Best post hole digger on the market. A friend of mine has one that i have Burrowed off and on for 20 years. Found one on Amazon. Identical to his . Same quality craftsmanship. Will be passing this one on for generations.
Thanks
Dave"
5.0,There is no other way to dig a post hole!  Be sure to have a sharpened long metal bar handy to help remove larger rocks and roots.
4.0,"This works pretty well.  I like not having to stab a clam shell type of digger, which I also have."
5.0,"This is my first auger. Was thinking about gas-powered auger for fence post holes... but now, we decide to use it for all holes. It is very easy to use. You need to spin the handle clockwise. We spent like 5 minutes to dig a 2' deep hole. Very happy"
5.0,"Used to dig a 25ft deep well.  I am not in the best of shape, but still managed to hit my target depth within about 2 hours!  The hardest part was removing hard clay from the tool.

Would definatly recommend to anyone."
5.0,"Excellent posthole digger.  Works about 4 times faster than the inconvenient clamshell style.  Works better than clamshell in normal soil, sand, gravel, or just about anything else.  The one thing the clamshell is better for is grass roots.  With sand, it helps to wet it down for easier removal.
Worked great for digging sideways as well, to run water and power under a driveway.  You just have to add lots of 2' extensions as you go, and it uses standard 3/4"" gas or water pipe, so ever inexpensive to do.  When you are up against a wall, you have to constantly remove and insert the handle, but it is still better than the clamshell type even then.  Very strong, sharp, and fairly indestructible even if you hit a lot of rocks."
5.0,This thing is great. Sturdy and works as advertised
4.0,"The Seymour AU-S6 Auger is reasonably heavy-duty and was exactly what I wanted for digging fifteen, shallow exploratory well holes.  The comments of other reviewers regarding the screw that Seymour supplies is correct.  You'll want to supply your own screw and drill a pilot hole in the maple handle, if you want to use the screw.  However, the wooden handle is heavily lacquered and a bit oversize, so I was able to attach it snuggly without the screw simply by banging it on with a large hammer.  It works fine without the screw.  As for digging, forget about digging thru roots over 1/4"" or gravel over 1"" or very wet soil.  Otherwise, it's great and fast, although you'd better get a beefy assistant if you want to dig holes more than 20 feet deep. My biggest headache (besides the roots and gravel) was that the pipe thread that attaches the auger head to the metal handle rod is not standard.  We only have NPT (normal pipe thread) pipes and fittings in my town, so I had to cut the handle rod in half and thread each end with NPT in order to add extensions.  Not a super big deal if your local hardware store is able to do this for you."
5.0,"just what I wanted works great, well built"
5.0,It was build well. It worked excellent.
5.0,"I live in sandy soil and can get a deep hole very quickly. I have NO rocks and very little clay or other hard soil. I feel this uses less of my energy and makes greater progress than the 2 handle ""stab"" and pull style post hole diggers."
5.0,Excellent tool ... had to dig 30 post holes ...  only took morning ... alot faster than scissor type digger and a heck of a lot easier on my old bones
5.0,"This is the best investment I have made of late and is the most amazing hole digging tool I have ever used.  In the desert, with hard pack clay and rock for ground, I usually use pick axe, pike, and shovel to plant posts and such.  My regular post hole digger cannot make it through the ground by itself at all.  As a petit woman who does most of the physical chores on our property, I can attest that this auger has made fencing, planting, and digging a breeze. I can get down 24"" in 5-7 minutes without breaking a sweat, which allows me enough energy to complete whole projects in a day.  I can only imagine how quick and easy it would be in damp ground.  I highly recommend this Auger!"
5.0,"complete, would tell friends .love Prime amazon.com"
5.0,"The Seymour Post Hole Auger is better than I expected. Works perfectly. This is the third auger I have owned, and this is easily the best one. This one should last a lifetime."
5.0,"I turn 60 this year and I am not thin.  You get the picture.  I also live in Florida and the heat is still in the 90's.  So when I decided to put up 40 feet of grape trellis with 4 eight foot posts sunk in three feet deep my wife started a neighborhood pool to predict the nearest time I would give up or collapse.  I guess I won because with this tool augering the post holes was one of the best parts of the job.  I don't mean there wasn't work or sweat involved, but it was a breeze compared to prior uses of a standard digger.  I cut a couple of thicker roots with lopping shears and in Florida there is no large hard bedrocks (so I can't speak about that) but this tool really worked well.  So the post project is history and at least I'm not history.  I would definitely highly recommend this tool."
5.0,It works great.
5.0,Works great. Haven't had an auger type PhD in years.  Sure like it better than the clamshell type.
5.0,Much faster and easier to use than the ordinary style post hole digger.
5.0,"I like the tool it sure beats the hell out of the  scissor action style, that will work u to death!! I used mine to try to dig a shallow water well. Hahaha.. Yea!!! What a waist of my time I dug 30!!!!! Feet!!! Yea! I dug 30ft didn't hit s***! Other then sand and clay. At 30ft or even 25ft it feels like your pulling a person up out of the hole. I didn't disconnect my pipe while coming out of the hole and with that much length and weight the pipe just snapped off in the air haha it broke at the threads so I could just go and have the pipe threaded again but if I had to guess the water is prob 50-160ft deep. Needless to say I'm done! And I do not  recommend !!! Anyone try this! Your just pissing in the wind. And for 4-5k to pay someone to drill it?? Just go buy a 4wheeler and a tank on a small trailer and drive to the creek and load up lol. Or get a rain barrel pipe your gutters into it. Way way cheaper. Then 100Plus dollars for 30ft of 3/4 metal pipe. And not hit s***."
5.0,Nice
5.0,It was such a help for us! It makes things SO much easier. My husband got it and used it that night! He is one happy camper! ;)
5.0,"Works great. Putting in a shallow well, went 11 feet in less than one hour."
4.0,Makes digging holes much easier
5.0,"If you don't mind hard work, this is the best thing since the wheel."
5.0,Works as it is supposed to.
3.0,"This is a sturdy, well built tool but it didn't work in our terrain. I was able to get one hole dug to one foot after 15 minutes and others I barely got to 6 inches. The was less about the tool and more that we have VERY rocky soil. When I gave up and rented an hydronic auger, it still took a day to dig nine holes! I gave this auger three stars because it seems well built but be aware of your soil type. I'm sure it would work very well in anyone elses yard:)"
5.0,"Great design. Dug a 3 ft deep 6"" hole in mud dy soil within 10 min."
3.0,It is a nice hand tool.
2.0,Standard two-handled post hole diggers work much better and faster.
5.0,Exactly what my husband needed.
5.0,This works very well and is extendable.  Clam shell post hole diggers do not allow you to get beyond a few feet.  These are relatively unlimited in their ability to dig deep.  I could not find these locally.
5.0,"As a satellite field technician I get to dig post holes every week in a vareity of soils.  This hand auger is simply the easiest way to get a hole in a short time without using a powered device.  I can get a 3 foot deep hole dug in just a few minutes.

I'm not sure about all the complaints dealing with rocks and roots...what would you do with them with a different tool?  It's the same here.  There's no mystery to a post hole.

In short, a great tool.  Don't be a whiner."
5.0,Works good
5.0,"Works great !!!! Made digging 3 foot holes for my fence post  a piece of cake never knew about these and normaly used shovel or ""similar"" device initially is was turning the handle in full clockwise rotations which was easy enough but soon realized left and right quarter turns did the job even better and remember when you dig keep ""emptying"" the tool as it fills. So easyI wanted to keep digging even deeper !!!!"
4.0,"Pro:  I dug three fence post holes down 3 feet with minimal effort.  I've use post hole diggers in the past, and will never go back to one.  This auger was so much easier to use.

Con:  The handle didn't fit very nicely.  One end is tapered and slides into the tool, but I couldn't get the handle to slide all the way to the center.  I was still usable.  I'd have to shave the wooden handle a bit to get a better fit or remove the of the paint from the inside of the auger handle holder.  Not a huge deal, just not perfect."
4.0,"The ground in central Texas is horrible (Austin). I basically live on some limestone deposits that when dry are as hard as rock. So when I needed to dig a new hole for some fence posts I was not looking forward to it.

This item is far superior to the clam-shell post-holer. Does it make hole digging as easy as digging in butter - no. You still need to use a good amount of force and effort. But it does do the job.

The construction is also very solid, I am pleased with its capability and design."
5.0,My father owned one 65 years ago. LOST  No surprise just a great purchase. Six year grandson  now digging big holes.
5.0,Fantastic post hole auger. Makes an approximately 7 inch hole. Takes 20 to 30 minutes in our sand and clay soil to make a 36 inch post hole. Hole can then easily be expanded if needed with clamshells or a post hole spade.
5.0,"works great, where`s the engine ??"
5.0,"65 years old and dug 38 post holes in four days, great tool"
3.0,"It's ok.  I have compacted, very hard clay soil with rocks in it.  This tool made it easier to dig holes to plant some bushes and small trees.  Every once in a while, I have to go in with a trowel to remove the dirt and rocks from the hole.  So I alternate the Auger with the trowel while digging.  It's not a miracle hole digger, but it does make digging holes easier."
5.0,I was skeptical when my husband decided to buy this. But it works really well. I can dig a whole in under five minutes that is two feet deep as long as I don't run into rocks or roots. We live in Missouri and the dirt has a very high clay content. This will make you sore if you dig many wholes though. We are building a 200 foot fence. I would recommend this product to someone that doesn't want to use an automatic auger.
5.0,works as advertised....  only needed it to make a hole for my silverback basketball post i bought off amazon.  hole was easy to dig with this..... it is now being used by a friend to dig holes for his fence posts.
2.0,Not very effective going through small roots.
5.0,Great product!
5.0,Easy hole I ever dug! Rocky hard NC piedmont soil in the woods with roots... 5 to 6 times faster and easier than the clampshell / pick axe combination I was using before this purchase.
5.0,Does exactly what it  is supposed to do. It allows the digging of postholes to be a simple task.
5.0,Nice quick beater.
5.0,Just right for the job..
5.0,Believe it or not this digs holes pretty fast. Less work then a post shovel. Easy on the back just keep spinning the handle and it digs right in
5.0,"Works GREAT. Easy to use, fast, efficient. Digs great, neat, straight holes for fence posts. My original purpose for this tool was to dig a shallow well around 15 feet, and it worked perfectly for that. Definitely one of the best tool investments I've made!"
5.0,This is so much easier to use than the clamshell type post hole diggers - especially if you have hard clay or rocky soil.
2.0,"Bought this auger ... guess not suited for the Rocky soil in Folsom  Ca... last for a few holes made ... top handle broke ... I think if the poleand handle were welded aluminum it would be a better auger

otherwise its a pretty neat way to dig a hole ...."
5.0,I used to dig a shallow well 25 feet deep.  Worked great.  Think i will put another in at 50 feet.
5.0,where was this thing when I built my fence 25 years ago. the ONLY way to dig a post hole
5.0,Exactly what I expected
5.0,Thank yoy
4.0,A little difficult to maintain dirt when lifting out.
5.0,This tool is awesome. No pounding the ground. Here in Fla The ground is very sandy and i just dampen with a hose and this tool cut it like a knife. I would recommend this to anyone with multiple holes to dig. Cut my time and energy way down.
5.0,works well
5.0,"works well, well made"
5.0,My husband loves his christmas auger!  Works well in heavy black clay.
5.0,Beats the dickens out of a standard clam shell digger. Works well in rocky soil where a powered auger just spins. Don't dig a post hole without it. Easy to extend the length with black iron pipe.
5.0,Works great
5.0,meets all expectations
5.0,"Very good within one our we dig 25 feet, it met my expectation"
5.0,Christmas present to son
5.0,This was my best purchase all year. Five minutes of light work equals a two foot deep posthole.
5.0,This is just what we were looking for.  It doesn't take brute strength to dig a hole any more.
5.0,"Many years ago, I dug many post holes with a clam shell digger ... very slow and strenuous.  With the Seymour, I did not dig away the grass first, so the start was a little slow.  But then this thing digs so easy.  There is no pushing, just turn in the direction of screw.  You can go as slow as you want.  You will have to pull the digger out of the hole every several turns to empty the dirt out of the digger.  It also seems to dig vertically without worrying too much and checking with a  level.  I did add an 18"" pipe to I could get below the frost line in Illinois.  A couple pipe wrenches are needed (or one pipe wrench and someone to hold the handle) to get the digger off the pipe and to add an extension.  The added pipe gave me over 5 feet.  Because of the added length, I will need to stand on a stool to get it started for any future holes.  Great product.  I want to go dig more holes just for fun."
4.0,worked well. But bent when I hit a root.
5.0,great product. digs holes fast.
5.0,"I love this thing!! One of my favorite tools now. I need to put a lot of downward pressure on it because of my heavy clay soil, but it's a million times better than any other post hole digger I've ever used! I have friends wanting to borrow it all the time. I used it to dig 100 holes in an afternoon while planting a hedge row."
2.0,not the best angle for digging on the auger
5.0,"Absolutely amazing tool, put up 9 posts in Eastern Pa soil - which is thick clay junk with rocks everywhere. Was able to cut through minor roots and didn't have too many issues with rocks. Awesome tool for post hole digging!"
5.0,Great it does what I want it to do
2.0,needs a motor.
5.0,Did what I hoped for.
5.0,Far superior than the clam shell style post hole diggers!! A must for any home owner!!
4.0,Received the auger quickly and work as expected.
5.0,It really works I have heavy clay soil I thought  it would be a waste of time but I need help getting a hole in this ground . I use to use the old fashion post hole and it took forever to punch a 10 inch hole .
3.0,"The shovel looked great and it is just what I wanted. One problem was the wooden handle was chipped and ( the handle ) should
not have shipped in that condition. Next time use better quality control on items that are shipping. I will rap tape around the wooden
handle where it was chipped to protect my hand. Thanks for the product.  Dewayne"
5.0,Really works great.
5.0,"I didn't purchase this for heavy duty use, but it has held up for making post holes and planting bare root trees without any issues. It is rugged and durable even in somewhat rocky ground."
5.0,very nice item sturdy
5.0,I like the fact you can add length to the handle with 3/4 inch pipe
5.0,Used to put up 191 ft of fence.. priceless!!!
5.0,So much easier than the Simple Post-hole digger that I've used for decades
5.0,Excellent.
4.0,"Have you ever thought about planting a tree, and then realized the tree roots would go all over and ruin your sidewalk, or foundation?  Have you ever wanted to drill a well on your property?  Have you ever thought your yard didn't drain properly because of some buried layer of clay or something?

Then you go to dig a hole to deal with the issue, and it occurs to you that digging a hole is backbreaking work, especially because in most of these situations, the hole has to be wide enough for you to fit in, almost all the way to the bottom.  Or, you look into renting a power auger, and it's ridiculously expensive.

Well... in the right kind of soil*, this is just the thing you need.  See, it's got a little open-sided bucket on the bottom.  You just screw it into the ground, and pull the dirt out.  Yeah.  Turn that T-handle on the top, and push a little, and down it goes.  When the bucket gets full, you pull it out, and dump the dirt.  Then you put it in again.  You can keep going until that T-handle hits the ground.  That's five feet deep in this model, which takes me about 20 minutes to dig.  They make others that you can add sections to.  I probably wouldn't try going more than 15 feet deep, but how many times are you going to need a hole that deep anyway.

No more dirt falling between the two jaws of those silly post hole diggers.  No more widening the top of the hole so the levers can close the jaws.  No more lugging a heavy power auger bit, and motor, and then realizing you've flooded the engine, or bent the shaft.  just use this thing, and do it the old fashioned way.

*Yeah, you need the right soil.  Not every too is perfect for every job.  In very hard, dry soil, these will take a very long time, so be sure the dirt is nice and damp.  In very sandy soils, the sides of the hole can collapse inward anyway.  Also, if it hits a rock, it may get stuck, or churn through the side of the hole.  You can try smashing obstructions up with a good digging bar, but these tools work best in pretty uniform soil, like good farm land.  Best of luck!"
5.0,"I'm not a handy person.  But I need to drill a well in packed rocky soil. This auger is very easy to use. It handles rocks of up to 2"" in diameter."
5.0,"Much easier to use than the traditional post hole digger. Just turn and the auger drives into and collects the dirt. Tore right into our clay like soil in Illinois. It's a lot less physical to use than a post hole digger. Very well built. Steel auger, steel shaft and thick wooden handle. And you can't beat the price, I thought it would cost more. I only have two complaints. The shaft could be a foot longer. After digging past two feet, it was a little tough on the back. And even though it was stated in the description it was not adjustable. You're stuck with one size hole with this one. But still good enough for a post."
5.0,"I read the reviews and thought it can't be that good but I'll give it a shot.  This device is awesome.  I'm 47 years old in decent shape and dug twenty feet in three hours in southern red clay.  You only need to buy 3/4"" extensions and couplers at your local Lowe's or Home Depot, add another one and keep on digging.  This is a well made American product."
5.0,"Dug a couple of 30"" deep holes for 4X4 posts in moist clay loam using this auger.  Sledge and digger/tamper bar to break up roots or rocks really help the auger keep grabbing soil.  This tool made short and clean work of a job that would not be fun with a shovel."
5.0,great product - fast shipping!
5.0,I had a similar hole digger that I had loaned out and can not remember to whom.  I had no hopes of finding another but this post hole auger is  just as good as the other.  you can take the handle apart and extend the length with another piece of pipe and a connector if you need a deeper hole.  Friends did that to mine and dug the holes for  the foundation of their log cabin.  I love the thing and so do the people who work with or for me.
5.0,I was using post hole diggers before buying this auger. This device cuts the work by at least 75%. Buy them if you want to save time and effort when digging post holes.
5.0,My husband has waited YEARS to buy himself a post hole digger. Always borrowed one. Thought they cost too much. But this one is exactly what he's wanted!  I finally got my laundry line put in the right way! Thanks for a great product at a great price!
5.0,"If you're still using scissor-action post hole diggers... do yourself a favor and stop!  (But keep them, and set them aside)
With this auger, I was able to dig the dozens of holes necessary to install our fence.  My first few holes were done with the traditional digger took forever and required a great deal of energy.  In the time it took me to dig 3 holes with the old digger, I easily dug two dozen holes with the auger.
I did keep the traditional digger handy, to scoop up the loose soil at the bottom of the hole that the auger dropped.
It's quick.  It's easy.  Even for a feeble cubicle-dwelling weenie like myself.  :)
If you're dealing with dozens of holes (or less), save your money/time/effort and buy one of these.  If you're looking at hundreds of holes, then perhaps the expense and hassle of a power-auger would be worth your while."
4.0,"This auger does the job. I added extensions on to it to do a self made well and did not work out all that well. It did go down very far though. Would of got allot deeper if I had some help but it gets kind of heavy after thirty feet or so. The only problem with this is your hole will not be completely straight and has a hard time digging through roots. If your digging fence post holes stick with a regular auger and save your self allot of time and effort. This will be great for Hiding things of value under the ground as ground penetrating radar does not go that deep and has a difficult time with mineral rich areas with high electricity ( heavy salts.) I would dig down to 30ft and cover your cache with half a foot of dirt, and then fill the hole with a bag of Epson salt, refill have your stash attached to a string and your good to go. Will take a while to excavate but that's kind of the point right?"
5.0,"Helped to dig those post holes I needed for two fences.
Good price. Good tool. Happy Customer.
Consider this instead of the standard post hole digger.
It's easier on the joints, your back, etc.
And, its *almost* fun to use."
5.0,"Take your time Seymour the auger can work you.  3/4 "" threaded pipe fittings ,nothing high tech here.
Watch the wooden handle if you drop Seymour  in the hole he could come on down and bopp you a good one."
2.0,"It was shipped in good order, the product is not good if you have clay with small stones, very hard to use, was able only to dig 2 feet after about a 45 min. turning and twisting."
5.0,"Working in Georgia I discovered red sand clay.  It is hard as nails when dry.  We had a wet spring, so I broke this bad boy out and I drilled 38 holes 4' deep over the weekend and I am a 58 year old IT guy so I am no ""weight lifter"" if you know what I mean.....  The simplicity of use and the clean hole are just extra benefits.  BUY IT."
5.0,"Very happy with product and shipper. Used to make 16, six inch holes 3 feet deep for a pool fence. At first I was disappointed until I figured out how to use it. Make about six turns and empty. You'll be surprised at how fast it works. Here in Arizona the soil is rocky and very hard but it did the job much better than the clam shell style."
5.0,"Quick and easy. And no more smashed fingers from the post hole digger. So easy you'll want to keep going, so mark the shaft for the depth you want."
5.0,"If you need holes for fencing, this is what you want. I have heard about people putting on extensions and boring wells with it, but haven't tried that yet. Buy this and a solid rock bar and you'll be good to go. The only thing that stops it is solid rock. Dry, hard soil is no problem. It tears right through it. If you hit a rock, bust it with a rock bar and keep on going. I couldn't be happier with it. I have no clue how it's not broken. I really torqued it down on some rocks just trying to work them loose out of the soil and was SURE I had bent the claws on the head. It scratched the paint. That's it. Five stars and highly recommended."
5.0,Performs very well in our sandy loam & clay soil. It holds the soil together better than regular PHD for removal from the hole. Small rocks were not a significant problem. The consistency in hole size and the ease of use are both big advantages.
5.0,I have used this to dig many post holes and two wells so far.  I have had up to 15 feet of extensions on it.  Held up very nicely.
5.0,This is a great product; it makes digging post holes much easier.  I highly recommend it; you won't regret it.
5.0,"I haven't used it yet, but it looks like a sturdy well built tool with a fair price. Get one."
5.0,I used this auger to dig a well 22 foot deep and it did an excellent job. It cut through adobe and clay like butter. I used 3/4 inch five foot long galvanized pipe extensions. This is a great product and I gladly recommend it.
5.0,"I use IT to drill 41 holes, 12 ft Deepth, in Soft clay soil And hard shale. IT was very good  And the cost per hole was too cheap. THe machine is good yet to Other 49 hotel, 12 ft Deepth. Very good machine. The hole was 7 in wide. I ought Other Saymour And buy Other Saymour to drill 14 in holes x 15 ft Deepth."
5.0,"I bought this auger because I HATE using a regular post hole digger. It worked very well, although I wouldn't say it was ""fun"" as a another review said.
In my opinion this auger was much easier to use than post hole diggers, cut through small roots pretty well, and digs pretty fast, but kind of a pain to get the dirt out sometime. BUY IT!"
5.0,"I have 40 fenced acres and needed something that I can easily carry with me to replace fence post because not able to get a tractor to. This auger seemed liked what I needed and glad I purchased it. Between my wife and I, we  have dug several holes 2 plus feet for 6"" post and it works great. It cuts really well and easy to remove the dirt from the hole. It will give you a workout when cutting through sandstone, but will do it. It doesn't do well with rock but soil or clay, will do the job."
5.0,"I purchased this for installing fence posts. My boyfriend decided he also wanted to rent a gas auger to drill the holes. Due to obstructions in the soil (tree roots, old metal posts, rocks) this hand auger actually worked better than the gas auger! And the holes were tidier too! I'm sure I will use it for another fence in the future, but for now it also works great for digging holes for plants. I have used it quite a bit since the fence install. Great purchase!"
5.0,"I bought this auger based on reviews here.  It worked like a charm!  I used a one man powered auger to dig some holes and, honestly, this tool was just as easy to operate.  Doesn't do well with large roots, but neither does anything else!  Highly recommended!!!"
5.0,This is the best post hole digger i have ever used ! the one I was left by my Grandpa is a bit worn but still gets the job done. Not nearly as fast as the new one. I highly recommend this if you are working in sand but keep some water around to helpstick the sand together to get out of the hole.
5.0,"I attempted to wash down a well and ran into gravel/sand at about 10 feet.  I came across the auger idea on line and made the purchase.  I was able to get down to 20 feet, which is the water table.  The sand kept collapsing in on itself so I switched over to driving a well point.  I was amazed at how well the auger worked.  It was a juggling act pulling 25 feet of 3/4 inch pipe, but it work quit well.  A relative watched the progress and is now in the process of doing the same.  If you have a post hole to dig, this is the way to go.  A very well designed and manufactured product."
5.0,"This thing is built like a tank and takes a lot of abuse in digging in harder soil. but the main thing is it is still being built in America by American workers in Seymour Indiana for the last 100 years plus!  Their pride shows in the Company name.  My Dad had one of these augers 75 years ago and dug many wells with it. it got lost over the years, but Dad would be happy to see the quality is still there.  And I got it at a great price, and very fast shipping included in the price.  Beware the knockoffs, your quality will be what you pay for, and if the head breaks off 30 feet down on the cheapo one, you will learn a hard lesson.  The Seymour auger cuts the earth like butter and stays in the perfect designed cup to get it all to the surface with no spillage."
5.0,Great product. Makes for easier digging on dry ground. Much quicker than the regular post hole digger that I used in the past.
5.0,"This is a fantastic manual hole digger.  I was able to dig a 3.5 foot hole in about ten minutes.  All you need to do is turn the handle while pushing down fairly gently.  Then you pull out the digger every few turns as the 'claw' section fills up with dirt and empty it out.  Then simply repeat.  The only thing it doesn't handle well is large rocks, but that makes sense if you look at the auger and consider that it is manually operated.  Beyond that, it's cost is about half of what a weekend rental for a power auger would cost!!  Awesome digger, especially if you are using a clamshell style post hole digger now."
5.0,improvement could be made  on the extension bars so it will not be so heavy to pull out so it could be used for greater depth.
4.0,"I did not understand why verified amazon purchasers talk about this product as if it was a godsend to post hole digging. the soil was dry and fell when I tried to pick it up. Then I used logic and started screwing, ""in one direction"", the auger deeper into the ground and the utility of this equipment began to shine. I was digging a few inches a minute after figuring out the mechanism behind the hole auger. I would definitely recommend or let my neighbors borrow it if they wanted to start a fencing project.

I took off one star because it was not easy getting the screw into the handle. Would it hurt the steel economy to use a Phillips head instead of a Flat Flat head screw? The quality of the steel was good but I had to get out a few extra tools besides the flat head just to pre-bore a hole into the handle before I inserted the screw in. My recommendation, please use a Rounded Philips Screw or even a star screw."
5.0,"I purchased this to dig 31 post holes for a new fence. The holes each needed to be 2.5 - 3 feet deep. In good soil without roots and rocks this tool performed great. Hard work, but I could dig a hole in 10 minutes. Roots or rocks jam it up, and I ended up using various tools (crowbar, saw, hand) to cut and remove them. I also ended up renting a gas powered auger to do some of the holes. The gas auger did better with roots and rocks, but it was no fun to use (heavy, noisy, blew exhaust in my face).
Overall I'm very happy with this tool from Seymour. Using both (the hand auger where I could, and the gas auger when needed) was a good combination, and is how I'd do it again. In good soil the hand auger took a little longer to dig a hole, but that was more than made up for by not having to deal with the exhaust, noise and weight of the gas auger."
5.0,"I bought this post hole auger based upon the reviews that I read on Amazon but I honestly had my doubts that I would be able to use it.  I am happy to say that my doubts were unfounded.  This thing works remarkably well.  I should mention that I'm a 61 year old female with wimpy upper body strength, so you don't need major biceps to use it.  It took a little while to get used to it and let the tool do most of the work.  But it's still work and I found that 2 holes a day were my max.  Like any manual post hole digger, it will not bore through big rocks, but smaller stones can usually be jiggled out by rotating the auger back and forth.  When that didn't work or when I hit a larger rock,  I used my narrow, long bladed transplanting shovel which was the perfect auxiliary tool.  A pry bar or some other long narrow tool would work as well, but my point is that unless your soil is totally stone free, you will probably need some other prying tool in addition to the auger.  The shovel also came in handy when the soil for some of the holes was fairly dry and trickled out of the auger before I could pull it out of the hole.  I used this auger to dig 2 foot deep post holes for a split rail fence.  It was the perfect size for these posts.  I am completely satisfied with this tool and can recommend it whole-heartedly."
5.0,"This tool is GREAT! I live in E. TN where all we have is red clay everywhere, but once I was able to get through the first layer of dirt I would get carried away and dig holes further than I wanted to. Very easy to use"
4.0,"I have one of these that was given to me by my late
granddad.  Was afraid to use it since it's probably about
a 100 years old.  I was amazed that they could still be found.
Will knock out a fence post hole in a heartbeat.  Can also be
used with 3/4"" gas line pipe if you want to dig your own well."
4.0,"Before I order, I was kind of a doubtful. Actually it works very good. Deeper the hole, easier to dig. I've a back pain and I can not twist too hard. The reason, I gave 4 star, because of handle. It needs to be redesign. I think, wooden handle can be replaced by fiberglass. The screw on handle is poor quality. Other than, it is a excellent"
4.0,"I'm really pleased with the quality of this auger. I've managed to dig a couple dozen holes in about a third the time it would have taken with a traditional post-holer. The only problem I've had is with the screw that it shipped with for holding the wooden handle in place. When I was screwing it in, the head twisted off, rendering it useless. I was able to use a rotary tool to file it down and slip the handle all the way out. I then bought a steel screw to replace it with."
5.0,This tool was worth every penny. To think I've been without it all these years. So much better than a shovel for planting.
5.0,"The post hole auger was purchased to drill a 6"" shallow well.  It worked perfectly and I now am pumping a moderate amount of nice clean ground water for my vegetables and fruit trees."
5.0,Just what I needed.  Everything that I expected it to be.  Have wanted to get one for long time. Does a great job!
3.0,We bought this item after borrowing an earlier model from our neighbor.  We were impressed with the construction and durability.  The new one we got isn't quite as robust.
5.0,"This post hole digger works well for deeper holes, but not good for rocks and roots. You will need a separate tool to deal with anything that gets in your way."
4.0,"This is my first auger post hole digger and it works well. It doesn't like rocks and my two-handle post hole digger does better with small rocks. It would have gotten 5 stars except for the sticker. The auger has a sticker with an American flag that says it is ""assembled in America with foreign components"". I personally think this is misleading because it is NOT American made."
5.0,We purchased this tool to use for my son's Boy Scout Eagle Project which involved placement of many posts and for use in the yard.  It quickly cut through the tree roots and into the subsoil to the required depths. We used it in conjunction with a pry bar to remove large rocks and made short work of the job!  Highly recommended
5.0,Faster than other kind of post hole digger tools ! Digged fence posts 2 ft deep in less than 15 minutes in wet clay. The handle is top quality wood and the tools is well made.
5.0,I had to do a garden fence and when asking for some quotes form contractors I was blown away... This auger did the DIY trick. It is worth every penny... easy to use and sturdy. I dug over thirty holes some 3' deep and it was a breeze. I do highly recommend it!
5.0,"I've used gas augers a few times, sure they're fast, but they take a toll on your arms, especially when you hit a root or rock.  This auger is probably a little slower, but at 1/5 of the price, it's well worth it.  If you're just digging a handful of holes, you'll be done in half an hour, and that's in lousy ohio clay."
5.0,I was able to get down 15 feet with a 10' extension easily. I could have gone down further. This is the way to go for a shallow well.
4.0,Does a great joj on post holes and easy to use. In sandy soil just add some water and the dirt stays in the digger untill you dump it out. Drills holes fast and easy.
5.0,"amazon as usual had a great price with free shipping.  i wanted to pioneer a well before investing a lot of money in sand point, pipe, couplings and the effort of driving the thing.  i easily got to 12 feet thru sand and that is where i first encountered water.  the post hole digger worked great, was easy to use, and packed the sand in tight.  never lost a scoop full even below 10'."
5.0,"I have been looking for a post hole auger like this for years.
My uncle had an old wooden handled one that I used for many years digging my horse fence poles.
It takes no time at all ....so easy !!!!
Just planted some pine trees..took me 15 minutes to plant 4 trees.
So worth the price..would recommend this to everyone."
5.0,"I've used a traditional post-hole digger (the kind with concave blades that sort of ""tweeze"" the dirt out with each thrust) and a gas-powered one-person auger. The former is just about as laborious as it gets and the jarring motion is grief on the arms, while the latter is heavy, noisy, dangerous, and difficult to work with because it can get trapped with soil and roots. I dreaded using either. Enter the Seymour Auger!

This auger is beyond being a pleasure to work with. It is almost effortless; I dug 18 post holes 4' deep for our garden fence in about an hour total - an hour! I was fortunate enough to not encounter any large stones in my digging; I think that might have presented problems, so I can't vouch for this auger's ability to work around or through rocks. I did, however, hit plenty of roots up to maybe an inch in diameter. These presented no significant problems, maybe require a bit more force to cut through and past. The auger works with both a radial and lateral scooping mechanism. You push it into the hole, turn it, and it scoops dirt from the sides and bottom of the hole into the central ""holding"" area, which you then pull out when it's full and dump. It does this exceedingly well. I saw from other reviews that wetting sandy soil might be helpful, and I can see how that might be. I think it's important that the dirt be cohesive enough to remain in the central ""chamber"" to be able to pull it out of the hole.

There are few tools that have impressed me with improvement on design like this one. The price is a bit high for a lawn/garden tool, but the savings in labor and enhanced safety is immense. Can't recommend this highly enough!"
5.0,I USED THIS TO INSTALL 35 4 X 4 FENCE POSTS ACROSS THE FRONT OF MY PROPERTY.  IT WORKED WONDERFULLY AND SEVERAL OF MY NEIGHBORS INQUIRED ABOUT IT AS THEY HAD ONLY SEEN THE CLAMSHELL TYPE POST HOLE DIGGERS. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND I AM ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT JOB.
5.0,"I've dug many hundreds of post-holes in my life, and this tool is the greatest aid to accomplishing that task I have ever used. Put aside your clam-shell diggers, buy one of these and a sixteen pound pry bar and set to work. You won't regret it."
5.0,Cuts a whole lot better than I thought it would considering its a 6 inch diameter hole.  Impressive.  They should take the screw out of the end of the handle tho - it has snagged several fingers and t-shirts.
5.0,"I have dug over 60 post holes on my property over the past 5 years with a clamshell digger.  Faced with digging another dozen, searched for a better product and I found it i the Seymour Post Hole Auger through online search.  I have loamy / clayey soil and it can cut a 40 inch deep hole in less than 10 minutes if I don't hit a major obstruction.  Make sure you have you pry bar/tamper handy for the occasion root or rock standing by.  Recycle your clamshell digger, it is worthless in comparison.  Gas auguers are heavy and dangerous, I won't ever rent one again.  If you have a larger project, rent a Dingo.

Hats off to Seymour, I can't figure out why the big box stores don't carry these."
5.0,"I am a woman, not very strong or young, and I was able to dig  holes in hard clay soil.  Note, it helps to clear off turf grass before starting to dig, also, chop the soil a little bit so you can get your hole started. And you may have to lean your weight onto the handle as you turn, if the ground is very hard.  But it does do the job. Rocks did not stop it, just made the job harder.  For someone without much upper body strength, this tool makes it possible to dig post holes.  ,Makes digging holes in softer soil a snap."
5.0,"Great tool ,I used it to put in holes  for the foundation of a small building I built in my pasture it workrd great ."
5.0,"Very easy to use, manufactured in the US.  Makes digging fence post holes very easy and quick.  I did find that when encountering buried debris (old plastic planter) the auger would tend to skirt around the obstruction.  A few minutes with a gardners hand shovel fixed this.  Our local soil is about 18inches top soil, 3 to 4 inches clay then sand.  I found the auger so easy to use I had to govern myself to keep from digging the holes too deep.  What a great product and I don't understand why its' not available at our local hardware super centers.  I'm inclined to buy another just so I have one as a spare to lend, etc."
5.0,"this is the best HOLE digger ever, i used it too dig a well 24 feet, and worked like a charm. it can get heavy as i was using gas line pipe, but until i hit about 12 feet, i did it by myself before incorperating  help to pull it up as the water would cause a sucking u would have to break free of. but in the spring i'm gonna dig another one, an plan on using lighter pipe, i don't know what yet, but i will update if i find something that works.but also i'm a 51 year old female. the neatest tool in the shed."
5.0,"Well worth the money.  Much easier and faster than traditional post hole diggers.  I've used it quite a bit: planting trees and building fence.  The only problem I had was when I tried to auger out a post hole for my dog run.  I needed the post right at the corner of the house, but couldn't use the auger because the handle would not clear the corner.  Not a big problem.  I just borrowed a post hole digger for that one.  Speaking of borrowing, my neighbor borrows my auger quite often.  I'm sure he'd give it 5 stars as well."
5.0,"I had a big ? at first, but once it learned to use it,WOW. Get the hole stared and get the ground moist and dig dig dig."
5.0,I originally bought another type of post hole digger and was super disappointed. I was putting up a fence in my free time so I didn't want to rent a two man gas operated one due to time constraints. This auger is great and easy to use. I highly recommend it to anyone.
5.0,"This is an exact copy of the one i had many years ago. That one as well as this makes post hole boring a ""breeze!""."
5.0,The auger works great.  It digs in hard clay with ease.  I dug a hole about 18' deep with no problem.  Adding and removing pipe extensions is no problem.
5.0,Aside from a gas auger this unit performs well. Don't forget to buy the extra pipe lengths at Home Depot.
4.0,"After lots of reading, an an aborted attempt to use a power auger to dig a shallow well I decided to try this auger.

It is very well made, but there is one problem:  the pole is firmly and very well painted and attached to the shovel.  I was not going to be able to remove it to add extensions. After due consideration I took out my small propane torch, heated the offending area and commenced to whack on it with a three pound maul. I was concerned that I might crack the metal, but finally I managed to unscrew it. I have successfully used the auger to dig down to water, so it is well worth both the price and the exercise."
5.0,"As a kid, I had a job building about three miles of fence. I was handed a pinch type post hole digger, a tape measure and turned loose. About half way through, I was grumping with a friend about the accumulating blisters and he loaned me his dad's Seymour auger digger. What a revelation! The rest of the job was magnitudes easier using this tool. Plus the posts fit better.

For digging post holes, the only thing easier than this tool would be a powered auger!

When I encounter roots, I use a tool called a Mutt, a heavy, wide, sharp, steel chisel blade on a long handle. Big rocks? There is no easy way to handle those no matter what tool you use short of dynamite. Every time I use the Seymour helping friends, their reaction has always been the same as mine was years ago, ""Where was this tool when I needed it before!"""
5.0,Went down about 25 feet in about 5 hours.  Hit two big rocks and it managed to work them out along with some help from the garden hose.
5.0,"Digs holes quickly. I set aside an entire day to dig posts for a new gate, and was done in about 15 minutes. It's able to dig quite a deep hole; the ones I dug were about 3 feet deep. The only problem I encountered was the wooden handle it came with. The handle is very sturdy but I had to really hammer it to fit into the hole at the top of the auger"
1.0,"I was impressed with the review on how a well was dug with this tool.  Based on that review I purchased one through Amazon.
I know that it is not a backhoe and did not expect it to dig through roots and stones and it did not disappoint me one bit on this point.  Even the smallest roots and stones were too formidable for it to dislodge.
I planned to use it to dig 12-18 inch deep holes for a large number of plants for our landscape.  Seemed much better than a post-hole digger, but I came to realize that it wasn't.
Don't know how the well diggers got the soil back to the surface from so far down, but with the powdery soil I have here, I could not extract soil from a 12 inch hole.  I tilted the tool to the long sides in an effort to remove the soil, but it just ran out the openings in the sides.
Had to resort to using a narrow, long blade spade to cut the roots, move stones, and remove soil.  Can do this without an auger.
Based on this experience, I really don't need this very expensive auger when I have to use the garden spade I already owned as a backup."
5.0,"We used this for building my deck.  Unfortunately if you are in an area with a lot of rock this will be of no help to you.  But my yard did not contain much rock so it made this the perfect tool.  It works great, and even better if you start the first couple of inches with the clamshell diggers.  After about 4 inches it pulls itself into the ground with minimal effort. I would have to say the hardest part was knocking the dirt out of the shovel, not getting it out of the ground.

The tool is made mostly of metal and seems like it will last a lifetime.  The handle is wood, and even if it breaks it seems like it would be inexpensive and easy to replace.

I would recommend these to anyone."
5.0,"Used the item to dig a shallow well to 34'. I just added 3/4"" pipe and couplers and dug away. The auger did get heavy but a tripod and assistance from the wife helped."
5.0,"I bought this for digging holes and that is exactly what is does. This tool probably shaved a couple hours of digging for a new fence I installed around my house. Of course there is always the possibility of hitting a rock or thick tree root but that is the case with a post-hole digger or tradtional shovel. This will cut some smaller roots. I found the best combination for digging with this tool is to have a pole saw - hit a big tree root, drop the pole saw down the hole, cut, continue digging. Digging amongst a variety of pines trees with numerous shallow roots I average about 5 min/hole. I also found this tool is perfect for planting potted plants. Overall, this is a quality product that should be added to any do-it-yourselfer's or gardener's shed."
5.0,"I'm doing post holes in Aiken, South Carolina with a couple of inches of sand and then clay. With this tool, it is WAY easier to dig the holes than using clam-shell post hole diggers."
3.0,"If there are any rocks in your way, you are SOL WIH THIS THING!

Ohterwise it's no better than your standard post digger!"
5.0,Very easy to work with. This post hole digger makes precise holes with little effort.
5.0,"Took me about 10 minutes to dig two neat 3-foot holes in soft soil. It can punch through clay too, but that takes more effort. As other reviewers have pointed out, you can extend it with 3/4"" (1"" OD) steel pipes.

One shortcoming I noticed is that the shaft is a little too short (3'). If you're only going to use this to dig post holes, 3' is enough. If you want to dig a deeper hole, you'll drill as deep as you can with the original shaft, and then swap the shaft for a standard 10' pipe from Home Depot, and the top end of the pipe will be 7' from the ground - most likely out of your reach. This could've been avoided by making the standard shaft just a little longer."
5.0,This is the most amazing hole digger.  Excellent design gets the soil/clay/stones out easily into the middle of the digger - you pick it up and dump it out a bucket at a time. So easy compared to spade digging or those double spade diggers.
5.0,"Helped us put up our entired fence!  Safer than a powered one, not too heavy, definitely did the job.  And for a decent price too!"
5.0,"This is the best post hole digger ever.  It actually makes the process fun. I find it much easier than the scissor action of a regular post hole digger. I had used one to help my sister build a garden trellis.  My cousin had lent us an ancient Seymour auger.  It made the hole digging so much fun I had to purchase one for myself.
I am a 60 year old female, so if I can do it anyone can."
5.0,"I've just punched a couple of holes with this, but it cuts like a champ.  I felt it when it hit the clay hardpan layer and thought I was just into the normal red clay since it went through it rather easily.  I was shocked when I actually looked at some of the clay, it wasn't the plain red, it was the brick quality clay we have in pockets around here.  Now I'm really impressed.  Cannot tell about how much sharpening it will need, but I expect it will.  Also haven't tried it with extension pipe on it yet."
5.0,"If you want to dig a post hole, this is the only way to go.  No matter thesoil, sand to clay, it is easier to dig and you will get a better hole.  I heard about a guy around here that dug a 30 ft water well with one.  They work great."
5.0,"My Dad, purchased this item 60 years ago, and I sold it at a garage sale 20 years ago because I did not need it anymore. Recently needed it again and could not locate it. Lucky to find it so I purchased it and my job was as easy as pie.
If you need an easy way to put up fence posts, this is the tool."
5.0,"This sprayer is made of thick plastic, and does not leak, even when dropped down the stairs. It sprays evenly, and doesn't seem to clog up.. The spray is adjustable in various ways. The bottle has a write-on label which can be used to note the contents of the bottle. It performs very well, overall.

The sprayer only has graduated markings up to 24 oz., so be aware of that if you need a specific measurement."
5.0,"I've had other, significantly more expensive store-bought spray bottles that sprayed more per pull, were made of thicker, heavier, plastic, and generally felt more quality than this one.

That is not to say that I'm at all disappointed by my purchase - I picked up two of these, one for watering some plants and another for spraying a water/vinegar mixture to clean up around the kitchen and bathroom, and both work great.  The spray is fully adjustable from fine, wide-angle mist to single jet, and the entire thing seems to be made out of decent materials.  I will update if I run into any durability issues, but I don't expect that I will anytime soon.

This will do what you need it to.  All I'm saying is that, somewhere out there, there's The Perfect Spray Bottle, and I don't think this is it.

=== Update (2012.03.25 - 2 Months)
Still spraying!  After daily use, neither the vinegar nor the distilled water spray bottles have encountered any problems.
=== Update (2012.05.14 - 4 Months)
Still spraying!  I had the crazy idea of putting vegetable oil in one of these to spay on popcorn.  It kind of works, if you squeeze the trigger fast and hard enough... I guess the lower surface tension of oil prevents it from atomizing as well as water does!"
5.0,It's sturdy and sprays just like it's supposed to. I purchased several of these and they all work well. I've encountered no problems at all with any of them.
1.0,"Partially worked (but leaked) for 10 seconds and then stopped working completely.  Returned immediately.  I don't know if item I received was a rare, defective one or if it's just poorly made in general - I cannot make that call."
5.0,"I live in an area with extemely hard water, so I filled this up with vinegar and water and it's been doing the trick.  Much cheaper than buying store bought chemicals."
4.0,"I love this piece! I've found tons of uses for it. As my master allows me only small pleasures my choices were limited. I chose this item over a lint roller and string of Christmas lights. I was very pleased.

The 32 oz size is just enough to bathe myself, The fine mist setting is great for this. I also use the harsh jet to punish myself when I've been insolent or to stun small creatures that have burrowed through the dirt walls of my cell. I've sprayed all manner of insect an small mammal and can vouch for this items integrity. I also like the noise it makes when there isn't enough pressure to get the water out, sort of a grunting goat-like noise that I get a tremendous amount of enjoyment from.

I wouldn't have been against a little more lenient filter on the intake hose, sometimes I had larger granules that I would have liked to have sprayed from the device. Some simple modding takes care of this at intake but boring a larger portal for the water to leave the head was more than a little work.

I still recommend it, my master bought one to spray water into my basin without sullying himself by entering my cell and he really seems to be enjoying it."
5.0,"I bought some Sprayco brand 32 oz bottle sprayers at a local store. These work well for my car detailing business. Spray mechanism and bottle are well made and spray well in all positions.
I like that Sprayco items are made in the United States and not china. They are in Detroit!"
5.0,Its fine idk what to say about a squirt bottle I use it to spray my snake enclosure once a blue and for that its perfect
5.0,"works well, decent construction, good value for money, useful for watering and misting plants. I would recommend buying this if you need a misting bottle for plants, laundry, detergent, etc'."
4.0,Sturdy and strong and I believe it will last a long time. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a long lasting trigger sprayer
1.0,"Unfortunately, this arried broken.  The spray nozzle was detached and cracked so I couldn't even assemble it.  This was an add-on item to my order, but you're better off going to a $.99 store to purchase a spray bottle."
5.0,"Great price, and I haven't had a problem with it!  I adjusted the nozzle to mist, and I used it to make a wash to spray my veggies with.  I've been using it every other day with no problem."
5.0,This is a well made sprayer and I would recommend it to anyone who needs this kind of product for cleaning.
5.0,"The best feature of this bottle, in addition to the adequate capacity, is the intake nozzle at the end of the intake tubing.  It has a fitting that prevents any solution impurities from entering and fouling the spray head, the problem that damaged the previous bottle I had."
5.0,Bought these because they work well - far better than the pump spray bottles that carpet or window cleaners come in.  We have canines so we are frequently spot cleaning the carpets - the pump spray bottles that carpet cleaners come in are awful when they get about half empty.  This work great even when there's just a small amount of liquid left in the bottle.  Also very good when filled with water to discipline the pups when they get too rambunctious.  Good reach too when the spray is adjusted to a stream!
5.0,This is an excellent product. I have bin looking for a good long lasting spray bottle for some time. this is it. I use it in the kitchen and on house plants and anything I need moistening. I thoroughly recommend it.
3.0,"Frankly I've purchased better quality sprayers at Target for a similar price, but this sprayer does the job, and while not the best quality sprayer, it is certainly not of poor quality.  I'd say it was middle of the road, quality wise.  I would buy another one, mainly because Amazon offers it for free prime shipping.  If I had to pay for shipping I'd go elsewhere for a sprayer bottle."
5.0,I would recommend this for anyone that needs an all purpose spray bottle. I use it for cleaning my tanning bed.
4.0,"This is a good spray bottle. I needed one that was 32 oz. It would have been better if it had oz marks but I put one in with a sharpie since I make up Fizzion stain remover in this sprayer. And with 3 dogs I use a lot of Fizzion and so far the sprayer has held up quite well. When I needed one I couldn't find one locally and then last week I was in the grocery store and they had these spray bottles - now they show up!

Good sprayer."
4.0,"It sprays water.  That's what I bought it for, so I guess that's good.  Not sure what else I can say about it."
2.0,"Just ordered this product and it has not even been a month and the spray heads are loose and and one does not work at all.  Need better made spray nozzles, have to shop for replacements already."
1.0,"The first time I (tried to) use this sprayer, the spraying mechanism broke.  I subsequently purchased one for 79 cents at Home Depot that works great.  If I could give minus stars in the rating, I would.  I don't recommend buying this item."
1.0,One major flaw in the design of this product! The screw ring/thread at the neck of the bottle.  There is only 1 thread!!!!????  normally things that have to screw on have multiple threads - like a coke bottle cap you have to twist multiple times to secure it.  Well the geniuses that designed this must not have ever used it- there is only 1 thread which does NOT secure the nozzle to the bottle well at all! during first use the sprayer top popped off the bottle and the bottle fell hitting the floor shooting out a large portion of the contents- forget this product!!! DONT BUY!!!!
1.0,I got a spray bottle that only arrived with the bottle portion. the spray part was missing. I contacted the seller twice and never heard back. All i needed was the top part of the spray bottle.
1.0,"It seems that my and Amazon's definition of ""heavy duty"" are far different from each other. When I ordered these bottles through Amazon, they were described as ""heavy duty"" spray bottles, but they are very far from heavy duty. The last sprayers I had lasted over 10 years (no exaggeration, and they were used for some very strong chemicals and solvents. Regardless, I decided to try these. They are a big disappointment for the price of $4.28. WalMart sells better junk that this junk and at half the price. I will forever buy USA made ""Bottle Crew"" brand spray bottles, which is the brand of bottle that lasted me over 10 years, and a 6-pack of their bottles is only $16."
5.0,This spray bottle actually works really well. It's much better than any other spray bottle I've ever used. Very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"I was looking for something to disperse my Star San for beer brewing purposes.  This works just fine.  I managed to spray everything that could be sprayed (instead of soaked) and sanitized it all properly.

What do you want from a cheap sprayer?  I wanted something that created a direct stream or a moderately spread stream.  I got just that.

Works well for me."
1.0,the sprayer was very flimsy/poorly constructed. i had to be very gentle when using it because right from the start you could tell it wouldnt hold up. after about 2 min of use babying it it broke. a plastic piece that held the spring shot off. do not buy this item.
5.0,"We had a vintage galvanized can that was missing the rosette, this fit perfectly and works well. We were pleased."
5.0,"I have an old watering can made of galvanized metal from the 1950's. This year the original rosette rotted out, Saw this one and figured I'd try it. It fit my  old watering can perfectly. yeah!"
1.0,"Picture clearly depicts a red rosette with a BRASS face. I received a simple, cheap galvanized one. False advertising. Rip off."
5.0,"For years, I tried to repair the original can rosette on a watering can with little lasting results.  May local gardening store said that this part was not available.  When I found it on Amazon, I was excited that I finally had a lasting solution.  Worked great on my old watering can!"
2.0,"The one you show is brass, I got a galvanized one, not the same quality. Will not order again and you need to change your pic a false representation."
4.0,"My galvanized rosette arrived on time. It was a tight fit on my watering can. I re-drilled six of the holes to a widen the diameters,to increase and improve the outflow of water. Each morning and evening I water our gardens by dipping my watering can in our pond. With my can in hand I was today mistaken for a farmer by nearsighted nieghbor."
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these rosette heads for my watering cans. The illustration
depicts a head with a copper top. Apparently, they like to misrepresent
their product. Of the 2 heads I received only one would screw onto the
spout, the other too small. The label on the rosette said Made in Mexico.
I know at one time Dover Products were quality products. Most of the older
cans you run into today have rusted out heads. It would be nice to see
someone make a nice quality replacement rosette head. Perhaps, too much to
ask though."
5.0,We have gone through a few of theese over the years that were NOT galvanized.  This should last us for the rest of our days.
5.0,As a gardener one of my tools is a metal watering can. Metal makes you look cooler. The rosette as they call it on my watering can had rusted off. I thought I would never find a replacement. Well there it was on Amazon. Bravo!!I should have bought two. The rosette fitted perfectly.
2.0,"Not a bad watering can head... but smaller than it should be, and it's not brass like in the picture. Its galvanized and I'm ok with that, but the advertising is legally obligated to represent the product. They did not. Your old one is probably just as good if not better, if you enlarge the holes with an ice pick or small drill bit."
5.0,We have purchased a number of these from local stores only to be disappointed.  This one is better than the original on that was on this base.
5.0,"I have Rain Bird impact sprinklers and in ground rotary sprinklers that have been in service for 18 years running on lake water and they are still going strong! These brass impact sprinklers work great and are hard to kill.  I run my sprinkler pump at 30-40 pounds and I get plenty of coverage.  My 18 year old impacts and my new ones look about the same and they work the same!  Thanks, Rain Bird."
5.0,"For years I have purchased impulse sprinklers that work for a while, then plastic parts broke.
Now that I have the Rain Bird I am certain that this well made sprinkler will outlast all the others.
It is easy to adjust and gives good coverage."
5.0,"The Rain Bird all brass impact sprinkler is simply the BEST!!!  It doesn't corrode, rust, or plug up.  They're easy to adjust for various coverage patterns.

I go back 40 years (I sound like an old codger) to Central California where Rain Birds were used by homeowners and farmers alike.  I've tried the cheaper brands (I couldn't find Rain Birds at my local Big Box) but they don't even last a single season while the Rain Bird will last for years.  I purchased some Orbit Sprinkler Bases to go with the Rain Birds.  They make a very functional combination."
3.0,"This is fine product--Rainbird sprinkler heads are well-made and function well.  However, the chart next to the photo on the Amazon site is deceiving.  It lists the precipitation rate in inches per hour that this head can deliver.  Unfortunately these numbers are way off--by a factor of six!  This is the result of a small part of a chart from the manufacturer's website being recreated here without the footnotes: this rate assumes overlap from other sprinkler heads nearby--a 20' spacing if your spray radius is 40'.  So instead of putting down a half inch of water per hour, you're only putting down one sixth of that!  The snippet of a chart here defies physics.

I give the product 3* because it can't meet the numbers as advertised by Amazon."
5.0,"Replacement head for rainbird tower sprinkler, this was better than expected. It replaced the original plastic and metal head and is 200 x nicer than the original head. Seller shipped fast. I am very pleased."
3.0,"Need good pressure on the line to full make use of them, they don't wheart so well well have to repalce the in a year or 2 and I only use them during the summer/spring to boot.."
1.0,"Malfunctioning.
Stay away. No customer service recourse...S.o.l"
5.0,Great product!
5.0,"Still the best sprinkler available. Infinitely adjustable to cover just what you want to have watered. Reliable? These things are good for decades.
And... I love the sound they make."
5.0,"I purchased this sprinkler to see if it would work better than some 2"" pop up sprinklers that I was using to water native grasses and flowers in the back part of my property. The pressure in my waterline was a little low so the pop-up sprinklers would frequently not fully extend, dumping water all around the base rather than spraying around the desired area. This impact sprinkler was much more effective, distributing water evening throughout the area even operating at a low pressure. I will buy three more and replace all the ""pop-up"" type sprinklers in the area.

I found the impact sprinkler easy to adjust too, requiring no tools."
5.0,Rain bird is simply the best impact sprinkler.
5.0,"Well made, works well, would buy again."
5.0,This is an excellent sprinkler and is very easy to change the settings when using.
5.0,I purchased this to replace a faulty head that came on another unit. It works perfectly.
5.0,Strongly recommend.
4.0,Works well
1.0,"Not a good product, it stopped working after 2 months of use."
5.0,"Nice quality, works just as expected, good price."
5.0,good
4.0,Solid and reliable replacement for an earlier model.
5.0,Work's great and sprays farther than any other sprinkler I had.
5.0,good quality
5.0,Easy to use and works great...Really waters a huge area of lawn and we have a big lawn .
5.0,"Finally!  A sprinkler made of metal, that has a chance of lasting more than a single season.  This little guy has performed flawlessly so far."
5.0,This is the best sprinkler that I have purchased in years.  It beats the box stores brands.
5.0,"One season down and this sprinkler head is working great, even with our hard well water."
5.0,Does everything it is expected to do and does it well.
5.0,works great
5.0,A good product!
5.0,"Covers 3 times the area of my occilating sprinkler and is adjustable for dense spray or stream. I have a very large area of re-seeded grass that only needs water for a few weeks until the winter rains, so this is very helpful with that bigger coverage. There is no irrigation except a long hose, so moving this around on the base I got is the only solution. No one said what they used for a base if they had no tripod, but I bought a metal base from Orbit that is heavy enough to keep this sprinkler head in place:  Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base 58030. It is dark green metal, Holds the head just above ground level and does the job without the sprinkler head shaking or moving the unit, and is less than $12, both work great on my level lawn area and are good quality construction, all metal parts. Small enough to store easily, not too bulky."
5.0,Fantastic sprinkler head compared to the plastic ones I've used. I wish the clips were easier to remove for 360 degree coverage.
5.0,Cheaper than Gilmor and works well.
1.0,returned
5.0,Wonderful
5.0,Works as expected.
4.0,"Good product, well made. There are a lot of ways to adjust it, still learning. Doesn't seem to go as low as I'd like but again, just may be a learning curve. Love the feature of not doing a full circle"
1.0,This only rotates for 1-2 minutes before it gets stuck in one place.  Yard sprinklers shouldnt be high maintenance.  I'm surprised there's so many positive reviews.  I got sucked in by the reviews and bought it.  Skip this sprinkler - it needs constant babysitting.
5.0,Nice sprinkler head. Puts out a lot of water and covers a fairly large area. Appears to be well built and durable.
5.0,Best sprinkler I have ever bought.  Very well made.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"High quality, easy to adjust spray pattern, fits on the orbit sprinkler spike.  Max height on spray is around 3 feet if you need to spray under small trees.  Max distance is variable from pressure, I'm near a water tower, full pressure gets around 35 feet out, lower pressure sometimes has trouble getting the mechanism to work but once it does, the minimum distance is between 15 and 20 feet."
1.0,"Hmm, I am trying to find a right sprinkler for my yard and decided to give a rain bird a try. For some reason the sprinkler gets stock in one position failing to move clockwise.  I have tried other brands and they complete the right and left turn just fine. I have 50 psi pressure. Not sure why this sprinkler is not working as expected. It's going back to ad return ,  very surprised since material quality is really good. Looks like some reviews mention the same problem. I think I got a broken unit."
5.0,Fantastic Sprinkler. It keeps my Boyfriend busy for hours.
5.0,"Best sprinkler head I have ever purchased.  Heavy duty brass construction and easy to set up.  They do require purchasing separate mounting apparatus, but  found them easily and have been using them heavily since I received them with great results."
3.0,Note this sprinkler does not come with the spike that holds it in the ground.
5.0,Well built and works great
5.0,Greatest
1.0,"Broken spring, returned the item."
1.0,"Junk! Lasted 1 week. Bottom broke off!
Don't waste your money!"
5.0,best sprinkler ever.
5.0,Have tried so many different sprinklers and usually they stop rotating and end up in my junk pile..this has worked perfectly under different conditions
5.0,These are just the best. Very sturdy and everything fits so well they last forever.
5.0,"I just received this sprinkler and it works  wonderful, easily adjusts for angle and distance.  This is replacing a Melonar sprinkler I bought from a local store that cost more. In a few days it was extremely hard to adjust and would not rotate each time.  This Railbird sprinkler  does all of that easily and is quieter. Great sprinkler."
5.0,"When I was young, I work on a golf course every summer. The ONLY sprinklers we trusted were Rainbirds. They always worked, they never clogged or broke, and we could count on them summer after summer. That's why I chose Rainbirds for my own yard. They will never let you down!"
2.0,"I do not understand how you attach this thing.  For sure you cannot attach it to a hose.  Also, it just doesn't look, to me, like it is made all that well."
5.0,Well made performed as expected.
5.0,Quality sprinkler head rain bird is quality products
5.0,"The best impact sprinkler head by far. Have replace all my ""generic"" heads with Rain Birds and have been very happy. They just plain work as they are supposed to, no more messing with sprinklers. Adjustment is easy, and they are built like tanks, so they should last a very long time. No wonder professionals use Rain Bird."
5.0,"This is a great sprinkler - I have used one like it for years.  I think Rain Bird is the best of
this type as I have bought others that work like this but did not last."
4.0,Arrived quickly and matched what was presented online for purchase.  However wished it had the ground spike too.
1.0,"This unit lasted one season, then would not rotate as designed. POS."
5.0,perfect
5.0,"Great replacement for a sprinkler Tripod that I had purchased elsewhere which had an inferior sprinkler head.  Good spray pattern and adjustable.  I ordered another one after receiving this one.  There are two sizes available.  Make sure you order the correct size.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain-Bird-25PJDAC-Brass-Impact-Sprinkler-Adjustable-20-360-Pattern-20-41-Spray-Distance/dp/B00002N8NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain Bird 25PJDAC Brass Impact Sprinkler, Adjustable 20 - 360 Pattern, 20 - 41' Spray Distance</a>"
5.0,"Excellent. Just top of the line. I expect to buy another. Fully adjustable impulse sprinkler which sends water shooting wherever you aim it, in whichever pattern you choose. How comforting to get what you pay for."
5.0,Wonderful
5.0,Quality. Works.
4.0,Easy to adjust watering pattern by moving wire stops around base. Watering quantity is good to excellent with great overall coverage.
5.0,"I bought this by mistake, but item seems very durable."
5.0,They are the best!
4.0,"This is a very sturdy sprinkler head. The one down side is that because of the weight of the metal, water pressure is very very important. My sprinkler system didn't have enough water pressure to make this one work properly. It worked, just not how it really should have. Honestly I had to go out and buy the plastic model (from the same company) to get it work with my system. I should have looked into the pressure issue before i bought it, but i don't fault them for that, that was my fault. Even though I don't have it currently set up in my sprinkler system i am holding on to it because its just such good quality that it makes no sense to get rid of it just yet."
1.0,Useless and disappointing! The spring breaks after one week of use. On all 3 one I bought.
5.0,now  this is a sprinkler there is no substitute for a rain bird....
5.0,Product was found as expected. The coverage area is as mentioned. It is very well built and sturdy. It has become my adhoc solution and have suggested this to many of my friends and neighbors as I just moved in a new community and all are new home owners.
5.0,"excellent sprinkler very well made, I'm very pleased with the product and service"
5.0,This rain bird has some of that range
5.0,Love my rain bird! I can water my entire yard! Very happy!
5.0,Works just like a rain bird does and should
5.0,"Far better adjustments, smooth action, solid feel and apparent quality, than all the many others I have used.  Only have a few dozen hours on it so time will tell about durability, for under $20 I'm very happy so far, even sounds better, inspires confidence it will just WORK.  (I paid $17)  I would only ask for a bigger easier to grasp/twist adjustment screw head."
2.0,We have terrific water pressure but this struggles to water a 10' circle - whoops - maybe they count this as 40'.  all spray no matter if you adjust the screw to 0.  You can buy 2-3 plastic ones for the same money and they work terrific.
4.0,"It's a good product, however it's a little difficult to understand how it works and to get it to spray the way you want it to because there are zero instructions."
5.0,"I LOVE THIS SPRINKLER. WORKS EXACTLY LIKE I HOPED IT WOULD. SMOOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, EVEN WITH LOWER PRESSURE. VERY ADJUSTABLE AND NEVER HANGS UP. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5.0,"appears to be a quality sprinkler head, have not used all the functions, hope it lasts"
5.0,"Great sprinkler, heavy weight and easily adjustable..."
5.0,Works every time and doesn't get hung up in one spot. Excellent sprinkler for the money.
1.0,"One star because it was delivered on time ,otherwise POS."
5.0,"incredibly well built sprinklers, would recommend"
5.0,these seem to be very durable compared to others we have had
1.0,"I am very disappointed with this. The metal pin that is supposed to hit the bottom two clips to change direction often gets stuck. It hits the clips ""too softly"" I guess and it just sits there, if you force it with your finger it will switch again.  The result is that often the sprinkler gets stuck in a constant position. Essentially, not useful."
5.0,"works great, great coverage"
1.0,Broke after only 1 week!
1.0,"Stopped working after less than a month. Running twice a day for about 20 minutes each time, was wondering why my plants were drying up, turns out the thing stopped turning. Sprayed it with wd-40 to get it going again but 2 days later same issue. No point in this all metal design if it literally rusts out in a month. Return window closed 5 days ago but wish I could get my money back."
5.0,the best you can get period don't waste your time buying a sub-par brand that will no longer turn in a month
3.0,Typical hose pressure of approximately 55 psi makes these impact heads sing. Try to run one of these heads with another head that requires less pressure and it's a no go.
5.0,"Seems like a quality product.  This sprinkler head really shoots out the water quite far, much father than I would have expected."
5.0,"Works great and well made, being made out of brass it should last forever"
2.0,Worked for about 30 days then stopped rotating. Thought I was getting a Cadillac but got a Yugo. Beware.
5.0,Works great
5.0,Better than the plastic ones
5.0,"Good quality Brass sprinkler.
It fit my base without a problem.
Of course easy to install.
Works great with just a little adjustment.
Will be getting another one to use and one for a spare."
5.0,Rainbirds are the best
5.0,I thought we had poor water pressure but it turns out our cheap impact sprinklers were just wasting water.  These work great.
4.0,"This sprinkler does the job and works well. I have only have two small issues with this sprinkler. First, after each use I need to reset the spray direction the following day, even if I did not move or touch the sprinkler. The second is the two adjustments for setting the spray direction have two prongs making it a little awkward for setting the direction for the sprinkler. I do like having the on/off valve when moving the sprinkler to another location in my yard, but never use it to turn on and off the hose. I have this sprinkler for about one month. For the price if it lasts one season I will be happy."
5.0,Best head by far
5.0,Worked better than the Rainbird heads that came with retail purchase of sprinklers from last year. I purchased multiple heads and replaced on all old and new Spike Bases.
5.0,Absolutely the best impact sprinkler there is. Our garden is 75x55' and one of them on a tripod nearly covers it all with lower pressure. Don't waste time with other products like we did!
5.0,they work & they're NOT plastic!!!!
5.0,Excellent distance and easy to adjust.  Great product.
5.0,Fast shipping works great!
5.0,Worked perfectly and an awesome product we have used for years.
5.0,Best impact head on the market!  Built to last!
5.0,Works.  I mounted it on a plastic milk crate.  You need a 1/2 inch coupling pipe thread and a  female hose end adapter.
5.0,I've had lower end impact sprinklers gum up after a couple years. these are still going strong.
3.0,This head spreads more water farther than the head used Bosh. If you have limited supply like a well pump you will have to decide if using multiple sprinklers (Bosh better) or limited larger area Rain Bird is better.
5.0,"works extremely well, easy to set and comes with directions which some do not.  Got it to replace the crappy sprinkler head that came with a really good tripod.  Would definitely recommend it."
2.0,"Most have worked well for me over the years, but most recent purchase failed in a month.  Rainbird support pushes back a lot instead of accepting I got a bad sprinkler.  Exchanging was a pain as I would have to go to an authorized landscape supplier.  I expected better service.  Will try another brand next time."
5.0,Excellent distance.
5.0,"We tried a less expensive sprayer that was supposed to be ""just like this one"" !! NOT !! This is a very good industrial sprayer. It handled the job of spraying concrete sealer with absolutely  no issues. We would definitely buy another one if needed some day."
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised to see this product still made in USA.
Solid and rugged....built to last
I used it to spray a 28% solid xylene based sealer on my pavers...It did a great job....price is also very good for this quality of product"
4.0,"I use this sprayer to apply a very thick sealant on my stamped concrete sidewalk once a year. I also use it so apply a slightly thinner sealant to my concrete flat work around my house.

Overall, the sprayer is very dependable and durable. It applies sealants very evenly and does not require constant pumping to retain pressure. My only complaint is that the wand does tend to drip fluid when it's at rest, so you have to be careful where you set the sprayer when you're taking breaks during your sealant application."
5.0,Performs as expected.
5.0,I put the rain bird on a home made sprinkler and it's working great
3.0,Works Good
3.0,It is well made of quality material.  However the reversing lever should flip  up and out of the way to allow for an uninterrupted full circle sprinkling.  I am keeping it as can I can work around this engineering defect.
3.0,Most rain birds come with a spike to put in the ground and to hook up to your hose.  This one did not.
5.0,Bought for use in a hot tropical claimate with dry periods where plastic sprinklers perish due to the strong UV light. This sprinkler is well made and should last long. Works very well too.
4.0,good
5.0,Well made. Highly adjustable.  Much better than buying $5 heads every year.
5.0,"Unable to unscrew my old spike, so I had to order for the brass impact head.  I'm sure it will be fine."
5.0,Great product and works great.
5.0,These are good heads. I have a lot of iron  in my water that ruins the plastic ones in one season. These last for years and clean up easy. I buy these now.
5.0,Great
5.0,Great quality!
5.0,"Solid, much better than big box store models."
5.0,Great sprinkler.
5.0,as advertised!
4.0,I cannot give a review until I use it this summer.  It appears to will made.
5.0,BUY THIS SPRINKLER IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!
5.0,"I used these sprinkler heads on my aerobic septic system.  They work fantastic to evenly discharge the water, and are super easy to adjust to change the spray pattern and location.  Before using these I used regular plastic in ground sprinkler heads,  seemed to always have issues with them."
5.0,It works really well.
1.0,"Interior epoxy coating peeling after 1st use.
Returning and buying the smith which is stainless steel inside and out."
5.0,This worked great to spray concrete sealant on my patio.  This will come in handy when I do the fence also.
5.0,I operate a concrete pump truck. I have used different sprayers over the past.  This is by far the best sprayer that I have used.  The only complaint that I have is at check out I was given the option to have it packed in an Amazon box. I chose the Amazon box. It was shipped in the original box. That is amazon's fault not Chaplin's fault.  I am still giving the sprayer 5 stars
5.0,"Everything I heard it would be, great product will definitely be buying another"
5.0,"This works great, we use it to stripped wall paper and for removing popcorn from ceilings. Large tank, great pressure and is built to last."
5.0,Excellent product just as advertised.
5.0,Great smooth transaction! Product is perfect.
5.0,"This is a quality sprayer, I had received the original and it had a leak in the weld on the tank. I inquired Amazon about the issue and it was quickly replaced with a new one."
3.0,This is a super nice very heavy duty tank sprayer.  I do have 2 gripes about it.  The first is that the nozzle that comes with the sprayer is not adjustable and one is available but purchased separately.  Paying this much for a sprayer it should come with an adjustable nozzle or it should be a select-able option at the point of sale.  The second concern I have is that there are no markings on the tank indicating the amount of liquid in the tank.  Whatever you fill the tank with needs to be guessed at or measured by some other means prior to pouring it in the tank.  Other than these two inconveniences its a great little sprayer.  I use it for fire control when burning remotely as well as spraying all kinds of chemicals.
4.0,"Just have to be careful when you to close it before spraying.  Practice with something like water first or empty.  Make sure the triangle piece is all the way over clockwise before you start to twist it tight.  Can be a headache if you get the ""lid"" jammed.  I didn't but my wife and friend both had problems so had to walk them thru how to undo it and do it correctly.  As I said, its not difficult but its not simple either.  Its the only thing I know that will spray diesel fuel or petroleum based driveway sealer.  Great once you have it figure out."
5.0,Replaced a knockoff sprinkler with this one. Ran great all summer.
5.0,You get more quality when you pay more money - rainbird BRASS products are the best.
1.0,Used for less than a month and it broke.
3.0,It fit. Good purchase.
5.0,My old rainbird (25 years old) finally gave out so I bought two other spinklers. Neither one of them were worth the money I paid for them so I bought another Rainbird and now I'm a happy gardener.
5.0,"I have a large yard.  I get tired of moving the sprinkler around multiple times to water my grass. But this sprinkler head, which can water out to a 40 foot diameter, makes watering my yard much easier.  I've mounted this on an Orbit tripod.  It's reduced the number of sprinklers by about 75%.  It is durable, works well, and as long as it is maintained, it continues to function properly.  Some reviews have stated that sprinkler head stops functioning or oscillating properly.  If you use the sprinkler a lot, especially in an environment such as mine with hard well water, minerals and other stuff can build up on the head and it will stop oscillating.  However, I found that if you clean it and spray it with a little WD-40 it works just perfectly.  It also needs to be stored inside during the winter.  This is a great sprinkler head if you do need to get some distance."
5.0,well made
5.0,"The best there is, & hard to find."
5.0,"Finally, a sprinkler that can cover my entire backyard!"
4.0,Works!
1.0,GUESS AMAZON WILL ONLY POST POSITIVE FEEDBACK
1.0,"Connection through the tank where the hose connects was loose. Did not realize until I had $140 worth of sealer in the tank. Called Chapin and talked to customer service and it was not possible to fix the item and they instructed to return. How does a $100 sprayer come with a leak? My neighbor let me borrow his Chapin 1949 sprayer and it worked great. Great it if works, terrible if it doesn't. I recommend testing with water before starting actual job."
5.0,"Worked great, no clogging in the 5 gallons of sealer I sprayed"
4.0,I just did a test patch seems to work pretty good be nice if the hose line was longer and would also be nice if it could swivel; I will probably buy another one so I do not have to keep swapping dyes.... Its worth the $100 I paid for it yes you can get a plastic sprayer for $50 but I say pay the extra for this unit .......... I also bought a cone tip
5.0,"I bought this sprayer for use in sealing my concrete drive, which worked well. My only advice is when using concrete sealer use the spray tip with the larger orifice to prevent clogging of the tiny hole. After I switched tips there were no problems. I also used the sprayer to spray herbicide on the back part of my lot that was mostly weeds. The wide spray pattern is way better than the pattern from my little plastic sprayer."
5.0,I bought this to seal some concrete and while I had some initial doubts and considered not buying because of the price I'm glad I did. This made the job so much easier and I'm sure the final product looks better because of it! I used Eagle sealer with BonWay Gator Grip mixed in; never had an issue with the stream and always made sure to rinse out after use.
1.0,Not worth it.
1.0,"The rubber o ring seal expanded and now it is too large to seal the unit. I was using sx5000 driveway sealant and got three five gallon cans onto the pavement. The fourth one wouldn't seal because the print swelled up and enlarged. I put it in the sunshine to bake put any moisture and now have it in a plastic zip lock bag in the freezer waiting for that to work. One would think the company would use an o ring material like Viton that is resistant to oils and solvents. I suggest you pull out the o ring after every application, make sure it's dry. And, perhaps storing the o ring and pump out of the tank until everything is dry so you can use it later on. That might not work but it is an idea worth trying. They should sell o rings for this separately for solvent based liquids. I would have bought one. Thoughtless. I,will try this trick, look for another ring and if that fails, I will return the tank."
4.0,"This sprayer works wonderfully. I love that I only have to pump it up two separate times during a spray and it will continue to spray a fine mist. The handle extension is great for reaching and pulling the spray trigger is easier as you can squeeze grip it. The cannister comes with a plastic gadget holder to put the hose end and tips into so they don't get lost.

The only thing I can say that I didn't like was the tank was really heavy to move around while full. It was easier for me to set it down and spray as much as I could before moving it. The spray is very powerful but the hose itself could be a little longer making it easier to reach spots without moving the cannister at all."
5.0,Fast shipping and good product!
5.0,good as needed
1.0,"Despite the good reviews, i've had a bad experience.  There's so much water lost from the head of the sprinkler, it washes away the soil and newly planted seed around the sprinkler.  Thought it was a faulty head, Rain Bird was nice enough to send a replacement (6 weeks later) and the issue remains the same."
5.0,It's a rain Bird! Very good quality. I've run it the whole season. Very good results!
5.0,work very well.  Just what I wanted.
4.0,"good quality and made out of metal, worth the extra to upgrade from plastic in my opinion"
5.0,"This is the first Sprinkler of this type (in 4 years!) to actually work longer than a few weeks. NO plastic on these = YAY!!!  We had lost hope of finding a good quality, durable, ALL METAL Sprinkler."
5.0,used to retrofit a sprinkler with low quality head.
5.0,I bought this to replace a plastic impact sprinkler that I've been using.  This is SO much better and higher quality.  I bought this with the Orbit metal ring sprinkler base 58030 and the combination is perfect.  I don't have to use extra weight to keep the sprinkler in place.  Its sturdy and does the job.  Easy to adjust the spray pattern as well.
5.0,works great
5.0,I replaced the sprinkler head that came with my tripod sprinkler with this product. What a difference. This sprinkler head projects water farther and in a much tighter spray pattern. Even better than expected.
5.0,top of the line sprayers
2.0,Acetone causes seal to swell.  Once it dries out it returns to normal......but what's the point if I can't reseal it for a full day after exposure to acetone?
5.0,works great- very happy with the product
1.0,Used once with acrylic sealant and now the top won't screw back on. Wondering if the seal became enlarged and is preventing it from properly fitting.
1.0,Piece of s***.
5.0,"I have always been a guy who says, ""use the right tool for the job"". This is it. I applied a 26% solids concrete sealer to my driveway of paver blocks and it worked flawlessly. I initially tried my plastic garden pressure sprayer and all it did was shoot in a solid stream, no fanning. It didn't cover evenly so I then tried to roll the sealant on. Rolling worked ok but I wasn't happy about the little amount of sealer making it into the joints. And I noticed rolling was going to take a VERY long time. I bit the bullett and order this Chapin. What a time saver and a much better way to apply my sealer. I love it!"
5.0,"Jeez where has this been all my life.  When my old grandpa's metal can sprayer bought the farm, like most people all I could find in the stores were those cheapo plastic ones from Roundup or whatever.  But this is so well made, so easy to clean, that I'm thrilled each time I get a chance to use it, just like my Makita drill.  I love the nozzle rack that doubles as a wand mount.  Mine came with two fan nozzles, and they both sprayed very consistently but too wide for my purposes.  So I got their 0.5 GPM fine spray nozzle that isn't really a mist but is a nice 20 cone.  The all brass wand on this sprayer is the only somewhat weak link.  It's easy to bend it if the sprayer falls on it for example.  Not a big deal at all, just sayin' you might want to avoid that.  One person who reviewed this sprayer here I believe warned people how the lubrication inside the pump was not suitable for use on plants.  I'm not convinced by his argument because the manufacturer's package specifically states that the sprayer is designed for and intended to be used in Agriculture among other things.  I'll probably call Chapin at some point to get the straight answer, but my parsley and tomatoes show only happy responses to it at this point."
5.0,"as described, easy to use and makes the job a lot easier"
5.0,Works great!
2.0,THE TIP KEEPS CLUG UP WHILE IN USED
5.0,works great and customer service is outstanding
1.0,"This is the first time in 20 years that I have felt compelled to write a review. This product is good, that is if you like frustration, bad construction, non-performance, throwing something in the trash can 20 minutes after you open it, and pouring your sealer back into the bucket after all the preperation to get ready to do the job. Recommendation - buy a cheaper plastic one and throw it away after one use (in my opinion)."
3.0,"My husband has some issues at first, the end kept getting clogged with what looked like fluff of some kind, not sure if it was there from manufacture, now that its cleaned out it seems to work well"
5.0,Nothing better in the market
1.0,"Pumping mechanism detached from itself. Just after 3 months of fairly consistent use. Not daily,  but several times a week.
The cheap sprayers last about the same time. So unless Chapin warranty replaces this; I do not recommend wasting the money on it.
Will update how they handle my warranty claim."
4.0,"COMES PACKED WITH GREASE if using for horticulture make sure you clean it first, also try replacing the grease with some kind of plant safe lubricant."
5.0,Workers like it should
5.0,great sprayer.my last one is almost 25 years old
5.0,It's heavy but it works better than the big box store sprayers. Pump it a few times and it allows you to spray until it is virtually empty. Really like that it comes with two nozzles.
5.0,I used the sprayer on my 30 x 20 paver patio and it exceed my expectation.  When it arrived I took it out of the box attached the wand to the trigger shut off filled it with a solvent based sealer and was finished with my project in two hours.  The secret to my success was that I went to Chapin's website and watched a video on the tri-lock system and did some research before I made my purchase.  Now that I own this sprayer I will never have to buy another $10.00 plastic sprayer again.  So over a period of time it will save me money and time.
4.0,Sure beats the junk you get at most hardware stores..... The limit clips stay where you put them and they seem like they are going to last... So far so good....
5.0,"I've tried many impact sprinkler at my farm.  The extra cost of Rain Bird is always worth the long, reliable life."
3.0,Requires a 4 year degree in engineering to operate. Well made though.
5.0,We had four Orbit H20 sprinklers.  All the H20 heads failed when we did work on our water system.  We replaced the heads with the Rain Bird 25P impact sprinklers.  They work great.  I'm having to spend less time watering because of them. He also added half-inch O rings to eliminate the leaking.
5.0,Awesome impact sprinkler.
5.0,"I have been struggling with finding a great sprinkler all season long. With extensive research I have found that all metal construction will yield the best results. I have seen other metal sprinklers from not so reputable suppliers for a smaller price. I have decided to go by the saying, ""You get what you pay for"" and purchased the Rain Bird as they are a leader in the sprinkler industry. I could not be happier with the construction and functionality of this product. The sprinkler moves very smooth, has great distance, and with the proper care should last me for years! I would recommend this sprinkler head to anyone that wants a top quality sprinkler!"
5.0,Good product.
5.0,"Good sprinkler head-all metal construction. I have water that's 70 PSI with a 3/4"" hose feeding this. I'm getting at least a 30 radius spray."
2.0,"The spray pattern is not as good as others.  other products I have owned have a more consistent ""rainfall"" effect accross the entire arc.  this really only waters towards the end."
5.0,work much better than the plastic ones - excellent product
4.0,"It sprays concrete sealer but no where near even, sprays heavy on the outer edges leaving lines but can be easily taken out on your back roll."
5.0,First time user. Great product and very explanatory. I would recommend this product highly!
5.0,Outstanding product.
5.0,Excellent product
1.0,"Sprayer did not do the job I needed it for. The aggregate that is in the product clogged in the nozzle even when the company, after a phone call to make sure, said it would not.
I wasted $130.00."
5.0,Very good deal
5.0,"I used this sprayer to apply concrete sealant to all of the concrete around my home.  Worked better than any other sprayer I've used for this purpose.  You will need to back-roll after spraying to ensure uniformity, but that just takes a few minutes.  Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Excellent piece of equipment.  Well made.  Used it for several different applications ir different materials and  it worked like a charm.
1.0,POS
5.0,Good sprayer
5.0,Works as described.  A full circle of water that is more than 80 feet in diameter driven by the pump on my well.  Well made and hopefully durable.
1.0,It is broken and I need to send it back.
5.0,"Here's the deal, there are two other brands of impact sprinkler heads that look exactly the same as this one,  to the point where I thought they came out of the same factory but we'e just  a less expensive brand.  They are not.  The casting, machining and gasketry  are noticeably better and so is the functionality."
4.0,You need good water pressure for this to work  50PSI
5.0,"Worked great on an old sprinkler, I just unscrewed the head and put is on the old body, I didn't know you could do this and I am happy since the sprinkler was expensive and just the head was broken, I'd buy this again.  Also it's great because you don't need to replace the entire sprinkler and are helping to save the earth."
1.0,Terrible! Sub-standard product that quit oscillating after 2 months. I will return for a full refund.
5.0,Good quality sprinkler you cannot get in big box store.
4.0,These are fine for use with municipal water they but tended to clog when using lake water even though I had a filter on the intake.
3.0,"The sprinkler itself is solid and sprays well but the lever that moves up and down to control the travel of the sprinkler head is a very poor fit or design.  It required pliers (and I'm a strong guy) to move up as it continually got stuck in the down position where it's wire frame catches on a rounded steel component at the lower end of it's travel.  I took a tool and spread the wire but it still caught every time.  I had to use a rotary tool grinder to smooth off and further round the metal component that was catching on the lever. That corrected the problem but I didn't like having to do this on a new sprinkler.  Another thing I don't like is that the dispersal or spray control screw is far too small and tight to easily manipulate by hand, that's made even more difficult when it's wet..  I used a molding clay like rubber glue product to craft a knob to correct that annoyance."
5.0,working great. shoots water about 25 feet using my well pump.
5.0,"Finally, a sprayer that is built to last. As stated from other reviewers, this unit is not light but if you are used to a lot of physical work then it won't be a problem. Water weighs roughly 6 lbs per gallon so if you put in 3 gal of whatever you want to spray then you are roughly going to be carrying around 30 lbs at first.  I like everything about it, the pumping action is very productive.....what I mean is that when you pump it up you can tell all the air is going into the tank and not bleeding out around poorly made seals. There is no pressure valve so you can pump it up as much as you want. It didn't come with a carry strap but since I have never used a carry strap it wasn't an issue but I figured it was worth noting in case this is important to you. I wanted an adjustable nozzle so I also bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5SOM4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36 as an add-on."
1.0,"Returned,  didn't work."
1.0,The first time I used it a few days ago I thought it was wonderful for sealing concrete. Today on the other hand when I went to pump it up I got sprayed with sealant form out of the top of the pump.  When I loosened the pump and removed it the large sealing O-ring had swollen up and the rubber gasket on the pump was slimy brittle as well.  hopefully Amazon can make me happy without his sprayer again
5.0,Nice
3.0,"very nice pump,but it leaks out the wand even after you take the pressure off,not a very good  on/off valve very very hard to tote around when it is full!!!! thanks"
5.0,The best.  Ordering another one
5.0,Very heavy duty this prayer last a long time
5.0,I use this as a garden sprayer.  I love it.  I did order a pest control nozzle for it and it works great!  The two brass nozzles that come with the sprayer are very nice.  The holster is a great idea and works great for holding the extra nozzles.  The can can be heavy but with this extended wand it really isn't a problem for me.
1.0,This product did not work! Apparently this company does not test their products before they send them out. Mine arrived defective and unable to seal. I purchased this product well in advance of being able to use it and by the time I started my project it was already too late for a return. I will never purchase from this manufacturer.
5.0,Well built. I'm using in my garden and grove as a regular sprayer. It's perfect. Will never use a plastic sprayer ever. Would buy again.
5.0,Love it bought 2nd one.
5.0,Appears to exactly match the Rain Bird head I bought probably 30 plus years ago. Looks and works perfectly. The old one was getting a bit worn (but would still be fine if I knew where to buy some parts). I'm very happy their quality and materials have held up after so long. It's so rare nowadays.
5.0,"The Real Deal - made in Mexico, I think, but top quality.  Get this one, and forget all the Chinese look-alikes."
5.0,"Infinitely adjustable sprinkler head (depending on your water pressure).  Strong cast brass should last for years. Mine works great and the Rain Bird product line is one of the best.  I did have to adjust the ""trigger"" that moves with the sprinkler and is what sets it moving from one direction to another once it hits the adjustable bars as it was hitting the bottom of where the sprinkler attached to my base.  It was an easy fix though with one small bend with a good pair of pliers."
5.0,very pleased with spray pattern waters area very well
5.0,"Great sprinkler head. I recycled the one that came with the Orbit tripod sprinkler when it didn't oscillate (I tested my water pressure at 50lbs) and replaced it with this one, keeping the Orbit tripod base. I now have a great system for about $45 total."
5.0,Best sprinkler head I have ever purchased
5.0,came as advertised.  heavy duty
5.0,It works.
5.0,Sometimes gets stuck :(
5.0,As superior products.
4.0,Great product.  I wish it came with more nozzles.
4.0,Of all the products I've reviewed I have the most experience with this. I have used this commercially  since 2007. Use it almost daily. Some days for 10 hours straight. Many many many gallons I have sprayed with this. With the kind of use it gets from me I'm lucky to get a year out of it. But that's okay. I just keep buying it because I love it. It does not and as far as I know has never came with an adjustable nozzle. Comes with 2 fan spray tips. They're all you need. For home use you'll probably never wear it out.  Buy it.
5.0,"best investment ive made in my garden. it completely changed the way i water and helps tremendously with my IPM schedule. I recommend buying the fogger nozzle for IPM though, it sprays an ultra fine cone instead of a fan and makes less go further. This WILL be the last sprayer you ever need, EVER."
5.0,"As advertised.  This is perfect for sealing concrete, even with a heavy solids siloxane."
5.0,works well thanks
5.0,Well built
5.0,"Great sprayer.

Not much to say.  Built like a tank. Sprays like its supposed to. Simple, good.

This feels like it was made 50 yrs ago. Metal, sturdy, and solid.  Should last a lifetime."
2.0,"Somehow (a word I love) the top stuck at the top of the threads and wouldn't seal to the container.  Had to get a friend to assist and use a hammer to tap the locking threads free.  After that, worked great; but all the time I ""expected"" to save, I spent fixing the locking top.  No mention of this with the instructions."
5.0,"sprayer works great, a pain to clean after spraying pavers with acrylic, but worth the cost."
5.0,it's worth every penny! no disappointment in this item at all. highly recommended!!
5.0,Heavy duty construction! Worked we'll with curbing sealer.
5.0,"Great product, instructions are not so great.  I googled youtube and found instructions that helped out a lot."
5.0,"Plastic pumps like you can buy at garden centers and home-improvement stores don't even compare. This is built for decades of use, if properly cared for."
5.0,Just sprayed 12 gal. of stain on a fence today in four hours with this unit and it never clogged or didn't have a nice fan spray. I did need to get a .2 gpm  spray nozzle for my application (Chapin has great customer service). While your spraying a second person needs to back brush the stain on the fence. This thing was 2/3s the cost on Amazon as my local box store. Its a beast at what it does.
5.0,"Purchased this to spray a sealant on my stamped drive and patio, but have not used it yet as I wait for cooler weather in mid-to-late September. Got tired of paying $900 every two years -- last one lasted only through 2013 summer. I researched this Chapin product and found it to be top-drawer. While consulting with a local supply house that sells concrete sealants, etc., the tech helping me asked what sprayer I had to do the job. When I told him the Chapin Industrial 3.5-Gallon Concrete one, he commented this is the ""very best."" At that supply house I know these sell for well over $100, so buying from Amazon.com was a great deal for ca. $80 +/_. For long-term use the sprayer MUST BE CLEANED PROMPTLY AFTER EACH USE, which for the sealant I'm using is zylene. Should last for years and avoid paying for poor workmanship by those who claim to be ""professionals."""
3.0,"Still had some issues with the seals breaking down when a degreaser was kept in it. Chapin tried to get answer, but making sure it was emptied and rinsed out after each use wouldn't be possible with all the mechanics that use it daily. Would work great in other applications though!"
5.0,extcelentttttttttttttttttttt  sprayer strong pressure  i am  handy man
1.0,"to whom it may concern: since you asked, the unit broke down on my first professional usage and i had to run to home depot for a $30 plastic bug spray usit to finish the job...when cleaning it out for the return i found an 0-ring in the tank that seemed like it might fit, but no...somehow being soaked the the concrete sealer caused it to expand such that it would no longer fit and seal the cap...the $100 dollar tank cost me $200 of job time with its failure...based on performance giving it one star is overrating it...i can only wonder what the company will say and do when i get around to asking to return it...disgruntled and broke, i am...wayne goodlin"
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Great product don't for to order the spike
1.0,This sprinkler head broke within a month of use (used once every 3 days).  I bought the Metal Pulsating Sprinkler with Step Spike by Melnor at the same time and the Melnor sprinkler head has outlasted this Rain Bird sprinkler head.  Would not by this Rain Bird head again.
5.0,Excellent product! Works better than any other sprinkler we have ever had. Fast delivery. Very happy with this company and product.
5.0,Very Good Product
1.0,I bought 2 of these and each one lasted about a week before the metal started to rust and they stopped rotating.
5.0,"Just a quick note for you guys. This sprinkler is awesome just be aware it takes pretty good
water pressure to run it. If I try to run 2 sprinklers it takes to much water pressure so the rain
bird will not cycle. I would do some checking if you want anything bigger than the 25 series."
1.0,Stopped rotating after 2 weeks use
2.0,I bought three of these and one of them has seized already after just 2 months of use.
5.0,"perfect replacement, fit it perfectly."
5.0,"Works just as described.  Pulled out of packaging and right to the lawn, setting up is easy. Covers lawn nicely. Rain bird is used several times a week, works flawlessly.  Very durable.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new pulsating sprinkler."
3.0,"Very well built but it came with a limited nozzel selection. For the cost I would think they could have provided more. The only real problem I have is it has a problem with leaking from the nozzel when you want to stop spraying. This becomes a problem if you spray something, then it continues to drip (like weed killer onto other plants). For as well as it is built, you would think the shutoff valve would have been better."
5.0,worked Great and the price was the best I could find
5.0,"High quality sprayer.  I used this primarily to spray sealant on stamped concrete and works great.  Make sure after you use it, do a thorough job of cleaning the entire unit especially the hose and the tip.  If you do not do a good job cleaning it the spray tip may get clogged.  Feels very durable and looks like it will last for years."
5.0,Great price... Great product ..
5.0,I have used these sprayers for commercial construction applications and for personal use.  They are of good quality construction and are very reliable.
4.0,It working great and get the job done right
5.0,Excellent Sprayer and well made.  You won't be disappointed.  However be sure to review the Chapin video on how to open/lock the sprayer if you are not familiar with it as you might have trouble.  It's very easy to operate and does a great job.
5.0,This product was received as expected and works as advertised. My research surrounding competing products was well worth the time. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for this exact solution.
5.0,"After sealing our concrete a few years ago mostly using a roller,  I decided to order the Chapin 1949 when planning to seal again this year.  I got a pretty good deal on one through Amazon and was excited to receive it.  Upon receipt of the item, it was immediately obvious that it lived up to it's stellar reviews.  As one reviewer noted, this thing will outlive it's owner.  The sprayer has a simple yet smart pressurizing design.  It comes pre-assembled so there is literally no prep work prior to spraying.  I was honestly a little disappointed with the performance once it started spraying.  It was immediately apparent that the ends of the spray fan was coming out heavier than the rest of the fan.  So I ended up spraying in sections, followed by rolling what was applied simply to make sure there was no streaking.  Although this method was still faster than a roller with a paint tray, it was still not saving me as much time as I had hoped.  After finishing the original job, I ended up contacting Chapin about the nozzle issue.  As previously reviews have noted,  they responded in a very timely, thorough, and professional manner and sent a replacement nozzle within a few days.  I have yet to use the new nozzle, but their response to the issue redeemed my favorable view of this company."
5.0,"It is heavy duty easy to pour into, does not leak or drip easy to open and close. Was delivered fast and on time had no problems"
3.0,binds up every now and then but when working proper it works well  ---------look for something better  would not buy again
5.0,Worked as stated!
5.0,Anyone who has used a Rain Bird knows how well they work and are constructed.  Solid brass with a 20-40' distance.  Easily adjust it to your required spray area.
5.0,Wonderful
3.0,After a season it showed some inefficiency. Its it not sprinking. Seem to show some internal rust based on the water that dripped from it. I plan to have it cleand.  Will go with the plastic sprinkler next time.
4.0,Satisfied customer.
3.0,"Water pressure does not stay consistent with this sprinkler though it will with different sprinklers we bought for half the price. This sprinkler is solid and appears well made, but not worth the money. It also does not include the spike so there are additional costs.  I would not buy again because you can find other sprinklers at a better price that do the same thing or better!"
2.0,"Not much output.  While built to the expected Rain Bird standards, this sprinkler head put out a very thin stream of water which means it has to run a lot longer to adequately water an area."
1.0,"Nothing was said about NEEDING AN ADAPTER to use this item! Nothing! So, I am unable to use it so,
I am going to return it. I went to 3 different hardware & garden stores & there was no adapter's available
that would fit since this item has a 1/2 inch opening verses a hose that is a 3/4 inch opening. What a waste
of time & energy."
5.0,"good quality sprinkler, as are all Rain Birds.  However, it seems to be made for a sprinkler system.  I wanted it for  a solitary
yard sprinkler.  It had no spike base.  Luckily I had saved my old broken one, and could cannibalize it for the part."
5.0,This is a very well built metal sprayer.  It holds the pressure well and the nozzles and O rings seal the tips perfectly for an even spray.  It is a little pricey but there is no comparison with this sprayer and those plastic ones you see in the big box store.  This sprayer can handle harsh chemicals and just about anything else the normal homeowner will need to spray around the house.  The adjustment nozzles have a great range so you can spray back in those deep corners from a good distance or set it to fan and get the up close spots without it leaking all over the place or on you.  The unit is well sealed for leakage at the wand end.  There is a bit of a learning curve on using this sprayer - the top seals in a different way so read the directions before you fill it up so you won't get a face full of chemicals.  Amazon shipping etc. was good as usual - they are the best.
5.0,Easy to use. I use it for a garden sprayer. I brew compost tea ant use it to spray my soil and plants. Best hasn't sprayer I have ever owned and also the most expensive. Money well spent.
5.0,No complaints . Chaplin make the best sprayer on the market I believe .. Can't Jo wrong with this . U will love it
5.0,"Wow, a quality built product! I love the wide-spray pattern of both nozzles (I use it for spraying roses with compost tea). The pump works as it should, the extension wand allows spraying down by my feet, changing the nozzles is easy. And storing the nozzle(s) that you are not using is easy and secure enough you won't lose them.
Virtually every piece is metal and therefore the sprayer is heavy. Fully loaded it is even heavier. But the handle is large and lugging it around hasn't been a problem. A smaller person might not feel the same way."
5.0,"The first sprayer I got was defective.  The screw mechanism in the handle did not work properly.  I discovered this by the video on Chapin's website, demonstrating how their TriLock system works, and for which Chapin should be commended.  Great video.  I emailed Chapin and got no response after three days (actually no response ever).  I emailed Amazon, describing the problem, and within one hour, while I was still answering emails, I got an email back from customer service, telling me a replacement order was already placed, one-day shipping, and a link to a label for printing out to send back the defective product.  How can you beat that for fast service.  Amazon is GREAT!
The replacement sprayer has been working perfectly, but I really had to learn how that lock system works. If any other purchaser does find it frustrating to figure out, go to the website and watch the demo video.  Once you get the hang of it, it's really so simple and super.
The quality of construction and metal material is tops.  The tank is nicely enameled on the outside in shiny red that appears heavy duty durable.  Coated on the inside as said in manufacturer's description.  When filled with solution (I bought it for weed spraying exclusively about my 2.5 acres), it is too heavy to  carry around.  I use bungee cords to strap it on my little garden dolly and wheel it around.  I looked for a better option than hand pumping, but found only one portable battery operated which is all plastic (hate plastic anything) and the ATV 12-volt battery kind are overkill.  So I reluctantly settled on the Chapin because it is advertised as professional quality.  And it is.
20 fast and easy pumps last over half the 3.5 gallon tank.  Doing all my acreage takes only pumping 20 pumps twice, when the old 2 gallon Solo took 30 and more pumps over a dozen times.  The Solo took over 30 pumps even when new, but as it got older required more frequent exhausting pumping until it just quit.  Even the ""feel"" of the pumping action of the Chapin substantiates a precision-made product
The wand is not so long as I like, 24"", but better than 18"" as on so many box-store sprayers.  It is all quality metal and too well made and its performance too good to replace with the 36"" extension wand I bought for the Solo, which has a plastic nozzle as opposed to Chapin's brass nozzles.  There are two unadjustable; one broad spray, the other spot spray.  There is a handy holster attached to the side of the tank for carrying the wand and extra nozzle or more.  It is black plastic, but even the plastic appears durable.  I don't like Chapin's customer service (they could have at least acknowledged my email).  I love the product.
And once again I have to laud Amazon for its professional integrity and superior business policies of standing behind the products it sells, which make just about all other giant corporations small in those qualities."
5.0,Great product for a great price! We have used this sprayer  daily and put them to the test two words great products
5.0,"I just received this item and I am very impressed upon initial inspection.  Quality craftsmanship, minimal plastic, looks like it will last me a long time.  I intend to use it for gardening and applying compost teas, and I was tired of spending money on crap sprayers from Home Depot or Lowes that just clogs up everytime or the wands go bunk.  This thing is solid!"
5.0,"The first time I received this product form Amazon, it had a huge dent in the side of it. I called the, the same day and they quickly overnights me a new one. Outstanding job. I know the dent came from the warehouse because the delivery box was just fine from UPS. When I opened it, the cylinder was in its own box with a dent in the cardboard where it translated to the cylinder. All is well with the new product.m"
5.0,Bought at a very Good Price.. Everything I expected. This is really a good quality product.. I would buy it again.
5.0,This sprayer was recommended by someone in the concrete business. I needed a sprayer to seal my concrete. this worked like a charm. also used to seal my kids wooden playhouse outside.  with proper care and maintenance this sprayer should out live me. the quality seems superior. it is a little heavy but I would expect that.
4.0,"This will be the go to sprayer for me when I""m concerned about good, even coverage. The lid seals tight, keeps pressure longer and is easy to clean."
5.0,"Works great!!!

I have used this model in this past and am please.  I would purchase again if in need."
5.0,"Tired of buying throw away products sold at chain stores.  This American made product is well constructed and performs flawlessly.  I especially like the wide mouth opening, which makes it easier to mix chemicals (I use it for insecticides and weed killers) as well as the 3 gallon size. I also ordered a different adapter from Chapin customer service, which was in my mailbox in two days.  Well worth the money."
5.0,"You won't find anything like this at Home Depot or Lowes.

This thing is built well and it looks like it will last a long time.

Very happy with it."
5.0,"this product is well made. not the cheap crap you find @ lowes,menards and those types of stores. i would buy this again."
5.0,"I've used this sprayer for my lawn and garden this past season.  It has made my work easier.  I also added the adjustable nozzle as I use it for different purposes, like spraying compost tea.  It allows me to spray the tops of my dwarf fruit trees that I could not reach with other sprayers.  I use it a lot and recommend it if you are considering a sprayer for similar use."
5.0,"Used the tank for sealing concrete pavers with acrylic sealer.  Product handled thick solution with a breeze.  Had a problem tightening top (my fault), called company and had answer in 5 minutes after making call.  Outstanding customer service from manufacturer.  Would highly recommend product."
5.0,"QUALITY SPRAYER,GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM CHAPIN ,NEEDED A SMALLER SPRAY NOZZLE FOR JOB I WAS DOING,CHAPIN SENT IT OUT NEXT DAY NO CHARGE.ALSO MADE IN U.S.A. THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT."
5.0,"Was a little reluctant to buy this item from a vendor on the west coast (Reliable Hardware and Supply) for shipment cross-country to the Wilmington, NC area, but the price was great and Reliable had good reviews.  Bought it for $[...]  delivered, a great price (saved about $[...] over Amazon's price.)  Received on time, and in perfect condition.  Pump is obviously superior to any ""Home Depot"" pump I have ever bought and used, including stainless steel pumps. This review is a little premature, since I have not used the pump yet, but thought it worthwhile to comment on the price and delivery from Reliable Hardware.  Will rate the pump after I have used to to spray wet look sealant on 450 square feet of pavers.

August 8, 2012
I've had the sprayer over 1.5 years now, and used it to spray the pavers, mentioned above, plus used it to spray copper napthanate on a long wooden stairway, and used to to spray insecticide and weed killer.  Plan to use it to spray Hyperseal roof sealant and reflective coating on my southern roof (which no one except aircraft  pilots can see.)  Excellent hardware.  Even spray, and great coverage from one tankful.  Easy clean up.  Will likely last a very long time, thus worth the additional cost.  Will save $ in the long over the junky made-in-China throw away sprayers sold in home repair stores."
5.0,"This is the sprayer my concrete contractor recommended, and I must say it did not disappoint.  The sprayer is well constructed and sprays a very nice strong, broad pattern."
5.0,"I love this Sprinkler, I bought two of them to go with 2 of the Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base...Both are ideal with each other. I also bought 2 of the Orbit 62061N-91213 Single-Dial Water Timers. My yard never looked better, I get a lot of compliments on my yard, I set the timers to go off early in the morning. One goes off in my front yard at 4:00 AM runs for an hour and then the back yard goes off at 5:00 AM so by the time I get up I can move them to another area in the yard and run for another hour. Easy, peasy and the yard looks marvelous. Highly recommend. so well made on all accounts."
5.0,"Excellent product, you will NOT be disappointed. Great value for a $16 sprinkler head. I have 3 acres of grass to keep watered in South Ga, and this is the best sprinkler I have purchased. Well done Rain Bird!"
5.0,Best area sprinkler made!
5.0,"Solid, heavy duty brass impulse sprinkler, means this Rainbird is going to last me a long time. Super easy to set distance, and to set diffuser so it sprays evenly. Overall a great high quality product!"
5.0,"Used this to replace an Orbit impact head on an Orbit tripod, the difference is like night and day!  Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks and get this one.  Longer range, easier adjustment, and smoother action."
5.0,"I irrigate my lawn using surface water pumped out of a shallow lake behind my home.  The additional solids present (i.e. algae, sand, debris, grit), as well as the inconsistent pressures seem to play havoc with most of the impact sprinklers I have tried.  Many store brand sprinklers will not even oscillate right out of the box, as they often hit the first stop and stop, literally.  I finally found the Orbit 56667N Tripod Base Impact Sprinkler on Amazon, which worked at the required pressures; but then it stopped oscillating after the first season.  I ordered this Rainbird (with  inch male fitting) to replace the Orbit head on the tripod, and the difference is staggering.  The Rainbird is by far the highest quality sprinkler head I have tried yet.  I have used specialty Rainbird heads in industrial applications, so I knew they were a well-made product.  Rainbird doesnt make many sprinklers that aren't for use in irrigation systems, which is why I didn't go with Rainbird from the beginning.  I am glad I found this replacement head, and I will be making another base connection, so that I can order an additional Rainbird head for use at my second spigot feed.  See below for additional details of the Rainbird 25PJDAC.

MATERIAL QUALITY  5 STARS
The difference between the brass Rainbird and the Zinc Orbit was staggering.  The Orbit brand sprinkler was made of junk Chinese potmetal, whereas, the Rainbird had high quality brass fittings with bronze and stainless steel.  The Orbit model was based on a similar design, but taking the two apart revealed that the materials were not even close.  Even the washers on the male fitting were far superior on the Rainbird model.

COVERAGE AREA & OPERATING EFFICIENCY  5 STARS
Best coverage are of any sprinkler yet.  This model sprays at least 10 feet further than the previously mentioned Orbit sprinkler.  The stops also stay put better, but yet somehow are easier to adjust with a single hand, compared to the Orbit.  Rainbird is also capable of true 360 degree operation, whereas, the Orbit model is not.

DIRTY WATER CAPABILITY  5 STARS
As previously mentioned, this sprinkler head handles surface source water better than any model I found.  If you irrigate from a pond, creek, lake, or other surface impoundment, then this is the sprinkler head you are looking for.

VALUE  5 STARS
Fantastic price for such a high quality sprinkler.  I haven't seen high quality materials like this one has in residential grade sprinklers in years, yet the price is cheaper than most plastic impact sprinklers you could find at your local lawn & garden store.  You will need to make or purchase a base for the head, but even still, at this price you cant go wrong.

THANKS
Thanks for reading my review."
5.0,great item
5.0,They work great and last well. Best price I've found for a sprinkler that actually lasts.
5.0,"Good quality, work well."
5.0,Works much better than the plastic version!!
5.0,Great  replacement for sprinkler heard that have seen better days
5.0,"Rain bird invented the impulse sprinkler and they still make a quality product today. I had a zinc 1/2 sprinkler before getting this and the difference is night and day. Brass just lasts longer, and I can set up a pattern to fit any part of my large yard. Now all I have to do is crack open a cold one and watch the grass grow."
4.0,They are Rain Bird and work great!!!
5.0,Sturdy and great distance. No complaints. Attached it to an Orbit base.
5.0,Awesome. Has really good spread and consistency.
5.0,"You catch beat this sprinkler head! I've tried and tried, but others just hold up. Built to last."
5.0,don't waste your money on the cheap sprinklers been there easy to use easy to set they will out last Mr. cheap
1.0,Completely unsatisfactory. It works in one direction and then stops and will not reverse. If you nudge it it will do another cycle and then stop again. Completely useless. I would give it no stars.
5.0,"Works like a champ.  However the first time I used it, like others mentioned, it got stuck and would not flip back the other direction.  It turns out I had a kink in my coiled hose reducing water pressure.  Once I d the issue and straightened the kink the sprinkler began working flawlessly.  Well constructed.... use with an Orbit spike."
3.0,"I'm not exactly sure how these vary from one manufacturer to another, but the quality, coverage, and operation of this is superior to the head that came with the tripod sprinkler I purchased. I will buy these again as the others begin to fail.
Below is pictured the 2nd of these heads I purchased and was delivered today. Unfortunately, the middle wasn't installed or included and it passed quality control. I called Rainbird immediately to get a part sent. Not so lucky. I need to go through Amazon and initiate a return.
My review went from 5 star to 3."
1.0,Who sales a sprinkler like this without a spike? I mean really come on. No idea how it works so can't rate that. THERE IS NO SPIKE
5.0,"Way cheaper than buying new tripod sprinkler. And, the rainbird DOES fit the orbit tripod."
5.0,good product
1.0,"As a mechanical engineer, this is a poor design. Yes, it is made from durable metal but it doesn't function worth a dang.  If you know this design, then you know it has a piece on the bottom that flip it's direction based on the boundaries you allow it to rotate.  The problem is, this area doesn't create enough leverage (i.e. moment force) to change the sprinkler's direction so it gets stuck hitting just one spot while you're gone. And, you can't flip the directional piece up, like cheaper sprinklers, so you're left with a worthless, over-priced sprinkler UNLESS you're goal is to hit exactly one directional spot then this sprinkler is made perfectly for you."
5.0,These work real well and it's nice to have a few on hand as many of my sprinklers are old.
5.0,Great engineering. Love the sound too. Works flawlessly.
3.0,"I like that this is all metal, but it is not uncommon for it to get stuck in one position.  Also, any claims to distance of coverage is misleading.  Yes, you can reach a long distance, but only by not watering the lawn between the sprinkler and the farthest distance.  If you want even coverage, the distance is cut in about half."
5.0,I have 14 new ones running along with many others that have run for years. Rain Birds have always been quality.\
5.0,"This sprinkler is so easy to set up and adjust.  Plus, it creates the sound of summer when I was a child. Reminisce on your childhood while you get your watering done.  I know how corny that sounds, but honestly it does give good coverage and is a pleasure to listen to at the same time.  Rain Bird is the go-to name in the business for a reason."
5.0,Great product and seller!
4.0,"Great Sprinkler Head! - But the over-spray out the sides and wherever would rot my wood House-Siding or wherever I put the lil Devil! - Perhaps it was just the unit I received but the sparay nozzle that screws into the center body was loose. So I turned it all the way into the threads and it was not working like it should and only sprayed a few feet out wards, etc. So I experimented a bit and found the spray nozzle head worked best if only turned in a few turns on the ole thread! - I immediately grabbed my thread sealing tape and thank God I had some and turned the head nozzle in a few twist and was more than tight than, and than the real event began! Hehe

This lil dickens sprayed a stream at least about 40 feet or more! - Out of all the sprinkler heads I have in the 1/2"" size, The ole Rain-Bird wins the overall distance!

However, the over-spray out the sides with this Sprinkler-Head I could not find a resolve in why, and its particular design as to why it performs the way it does regarding the side over-spray. - With that said, I will use this head to cover very large areas, but yet stay away from employing it in say a Quarter section of the lawn area due to its nature, in which is a negative for this model by Rain Bird unfortunately.

Overall due to the distance this model can achieve and beat em all and also adjusted per the stream, I have to knock off a star or two due to: I do not believe that the head nozzle threads are matched to the body, thus taking out the guess work like in my particular case.

Perhaps it is just the model I received, but, one is at guess as to how far we thread in the head nozzle for the best mathematically performance, especially when it arrived with a loose threaded nozzle head.

Overall, I am impressed with this model by Rain Bird Mfg., but at the same time, I think they can improve it by putting on a head nozzle per thread length actually needed to seat that part properly. Again, perhaps it is just the model I received.

That issue along with side over-spray knocks a star or two off my review, BUT, Please Don't let that stop you if you are looking for a 1/2"" nozzle head to cover a very large area, like we have, Because, this model wins Distance by far, Hands Down compared to all the 1/2"" Sprinkler Heads we have!!"
5.0,You don't find many ( ANY ) products made like this.  Solid broze and SS.  Works great and should last forever.
5.0,Product showed up on time. Works as advertised. My only caution is make sure you have sufficient water pressure to make it work correctly.  This head takes less water pressure than some cheaper units to work but you still have to have fair water pressure to make it work 100% of the time. I had no problems with order or delivery. 2 days on prime.
1.0,"I ordered this because I was tired of replacing the cheap plastic sprinkler heads every year or 2.  Well, this one just didn't work at all.  The flow as great but it would not oscillate counter clockwise.  It would either not start to return or would stop in the middle of the pass.  Very disappointed.  I am returning it to Amazon who is great about returns. I guess the quality has declined since production was moved out of the USA  FYI, I checked my water pressure and I had 65 psi at the hose bib."
5.0,smaller than expected but I am sure they will last.
5.0,I have left these in my goat pasture with the animals for summer and winter irrigation. Through freeze and drought they continue to function without flaw or adjustment. This spring I will pull them and oil them up for another full year of use. Orbitz ones only last a few weeks. These are champions.
5.0,"Don't even bother with the other brands, Rain Bird is just better. Twice the range in the same sprinkler base. Turns properly even with low water pressure."
5.0,Really covers a lot of area. It needs to be bought with a flow thru spike base. It does not work on its own
5.0,Works perfect and very sturdy.
4.0,"Having been in the landscape business for 30 yrs, truth is that all sprinkler heads are temporary.  They tend to be balanced mechanisms and if the is just a little too much friction due to rust or the spring loses tension or the metal adjusts due to heat expansion and cooling, they no longer return or get stuck in one place.  A little love and care with new washers and grease extends their life a little but eventually they get out-of-balance and don't work.  Metals one like this one, always/always last much longer than plastic which is why always avoid plastic parts.  This is why I also purchase a sprinkler stands (also metal) that lets me trade the heads out the heads as they fail.  This latest one has lasted two seasons which in my book is good.  Poor quality heads last one or less and great ones last 4 or more.  We shall see if this one makes it.  In any event it has lasted long enough so I feel I got my money worth and will purchase this again when the latest fails."
5.0,"Great range, much larger than the plastic versions."
4.0,"Two of them I put back together because some of the springs fell off and they were used, but I saved some money."
5.0,Nice sprinkler heads.
5.0,what can you say it works and then works some more
5.0,Great quality materials...should last a long time.
4.0,"Good sprinkler but needs more water pressure than plastic sprinkler to function properly, well made"
3.0,Sometimes gets stuck in the far right position.  Otherwise disperses the water well.
5.0,This worked great for me all summer long.  No issues at all.
1.0,"Didn't function as well as my OLD model....kept going around and around...the metal clips were not working
until I figgled with them....but still not very good."
5.0,A good product. I purchased two and attached each to an Orbit base. I have tried other brands only to have them fail after a season or two. I find that Rain Bird products are built to last and work well. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a quality impact sprinkler.
5.0,"The impact sprinklers are great - we have about 3 acres that are landscaped, so watering efficiently is a must - the rain birds do the job for us!!"
5.0,"This sprinkler is very adjustable for a variety of distances. It is very superior to the Gibson which I have 3 of, unfortunately. It's not cheap but it works well."
5.0,five stars
4.0,I love the build quality on this sprinkler. Hopefully I get many years of use out of it.
5.0,Works great and gets the watering done!
5.0,This is an expensive commercial grade sprinkler head for a cheap price.  Buy it. Don't make the mistake of buying the plastic or aluminum ones.
5.0,Works great with Orbit Metal ring base
4.0,I received this yesterday and used it last night.  I mounted it on the Orbit metal ring sprinkler base #58030. The sprinkler worked just fine.  I ran it for about 2 1/2 hours and put down about 1 inch of water.  I was happy with this amount of water in that period of time based on all my many past and different types of sprinklers I've had over the 35 years.  I can't imagine this sprinkler not working for many many many years.  My last one lasted about 30 years. No joke!  Actually had two of them.  A metal like this one and a plastic.  The plastic one last about 20 years.  I do not leave them out in the sun however and may be the reason they lasted for so long.  I refer the metal one as it's more versatile.  It'll do what the plastic one does meaning it'll spread out a good amount of water for about 15-20 feet plus it'll allow you to water beyond that range for another 10 -15 feet.  The only time I'd buy a plastic again is if I only wanted to water a small area.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"This sprinkler is the ""best of the best"" for effective coverage, trouble-free operation, and long life.  I'm planning to get a second one for another sprinkler base I'm building.  Don't waste your time and money on anything else."
3.0,"Purchased two. One works fine, the other does not rotate for some reason."
1.0,Very bad sprinkler head. Would not rotate no matter what.
5.0,"wonderful, nice range"
5.0,"Replaced cheap plastic sprinkler head with this - been working great, used daily, for 2 months.
Seems built to last"
5.0,Classic design. Sturdy. Works. Need a spike or a stand in addition to this head
5.0,"Great product, easy to use and the price is right."
4.0,Great price and well made. We bought a few extra in case they did not last long and have not had to use them yet.
4.0,Easier to adjust them original
5.0,Excellent quality and performance.  Worth the extra buck or two.  Frank in Colorado
5.0,Great replacement heads for the price!
5.0,"This one is the bomb!  You'll love it. Durable, easy to adjust, lasts for years, and it produces that beautiful music. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. You could buy a nice Toro head and it would be better, but you'd have to part with a lot more dough.

Get this one. You'll see."
3.0,Not really impressed. There were no instructions and I've spent quite some time trying to figure out how to adjust it but I've yet to figure it out. I've used cheaper versions of these that you staked into the ground and haven't had issues figuring those out. I bought this one because I live in west Texas and I'm tired of buying sprinklers and them rotting in the sun. I'm sure this thing works when you know how to use it but it's not very useful to me...I give it 3 stars because I know it works but it definitely needs instructions...
1.0,Very disappointed with these sprinklers.  Ordered two of them due to the good reviews.  The top spring fell off of one of them after about two hours of use.  Neither of the sprinklers will cycle on the partial circle setting.  They will go clockwise but will not go counter clockwise.  Will be returning both for a refund.
5.0,This is a very good one.  Works like it should.  Will buy again.

I placed it on a tripod and it covers my whole garden easily. You can see from the photo and video what a large area it hits. The sprinkler is made of heavy brass and feels solid and like it will last for a long time. If you are tired of moving sprinklers around, invest in the Rain Bird!

**I have relied heavily on reviews for years, since I do most of my shopping online. I've finally starting trying to return the favor by writing reviews of products I love. I hope my review was helpful to you!**"
5.0,I have an old model my dad bought that is 50 years old and works just as well as the new one. It is a life time investment that doesn't require much in the way of maintenance. The plastice rainbird version worked ok but were not dog proof. My English Setter destroyed two plastic versions in one week. The brass model is a winner my grandsons can fight over.
5.0,Great Sprinkler..... I'd buy again!
5.0,works great
5.0,Product received on time and as described.
5.0,"Great product ,prompt delivery!!!"
4.0,We bought this to replace a head that was on an old tripod sprinkler that had quit working. It is easy to setup and works great. We have used it for three seasons without issue. It covers a 30*25 garden very well.
5.0,"After spending too much money on impact sprinklers at the big box stores, I ordered two of these from Amazon.  In my opinion, nothing I've tried before comes close to this quality!  These sprinklers rotate smoothly, are easy to adjust, and they have a very well-built feel to them.  I paired mine with the Orbit 1/2 inch curved tube sprinkler base, model 58030, and the results are great.  No more driving spikes into the ground!  I added a five inch nipple and coupling between the Orbit base and sprinkler head, along with a liberal amount of teflon tape.  It keeps me from having to bend over so far to fine tune the adjustments on the sprinkler.  This is a quality product!"
5.0,"Works great...I get about 40  foot radius and it hasn't gotten stuck once.  Since water pressure varies, your mileage might be different.  I expect this one to last a few years...it's not a disposable."
5.0,"I always using rain bird for last 30 years, and I loved it !"
5.0,"heavy duty, finally a sprinkler head that will last!"
1.0,Not worth the money!!!
5.0,"My husband thought the price was way too high.  So..... I kept checking Amazon for cheaper ones.  I finally said to heck with it, most of the time you get what you pay for!  Boy was I right!  This Rain Bird is a great product.  Yes...the hubby was super impressed my my purchase.  Every time he uses it he comments on how much better this one is.  It replaced a different brand that came on a tri pod.  The tri pod still works and this new sprinkler pit on it perfectly."
5.0,Great product
5.0,"Great. Still the champ. I bought a Melnor and Orbit for comparison. Rainbird wins, but also the most expensive."
4.0,"OK, I asked the question what size nozzle do these come with, no one answered, I bought one of these just to check, 5/32"" nozzle which puts out aprox 4.5 GPM at 40 lbs pressure. Just what I need but I need to buy in bulk, not the packaged deal they come in."
5.0,Works great!
5.0,works well
5.0,"Solid brass construction, will last for years. Easy to change angle of rotation."
4.0,This sprinkler is well made and works well... But does not come with a stake. Rainbird doesn't even sell a stake so I had to buy a cheap plastic sprinkler to get a stake.
5.0,Smaller size.... great yard sprinkler.
1.0,"I thought this would be a great sprinkler based on the reviews and the Rain Bird reputation, but mine is a dud.  It gets stuck in one spot causing a flood and will not rotate the opposite way.  I read on another review that the position of the stops matters and I've tried switching them so that the top stop is on one side and the bottom the other, and vice-versa, but that did not resolve the problem. I might try some light grease on the stem but if that doesn't resolve then I'm out $15.  I'm using this sprinkler on the Orbit sprinkler base (#58030) and there is plenty of water pressure.  Similar Orbit impact heads I bought do not have the problem I'm having with the Rain Bird. I'm disappointed as I was hoping this would be a great product."
5.0,Arrived on time and is as advertised. Performs well
3.0,"Good quality and function for its design, however the spray pattern is far too large for an urban yard. When it says 20'-40' it really means that the sprinkler sprays 20'-40' each way which actually equals 40'-80' circle spray pattern. Will also note that they claim is a new design that keeps splash off of walls and sidewalks, I find this to not be true at all. I use this on a portable stand and while it waters very well I would advise a swimsuit when adjusting the spray pattern"
5.0,As promised!
5.0,"The raintower heads got crushed by a truck, AMAZON had the replacements at great price."
4.0,These things work better than my 20 year old ones. That's just exactly what I expected.
5.0,"Even though it arrived late in the season, brief testing showed it did what it advertised."
5.0,It was exactly what I expected and arrived in a timely manner.
5.0,Do I need to write anymore?
5.0,"I have one of these that my father had for a while.  They hold up well and work as advertised.  A little pricey initially but really pays for itself by not having to buy replacements.  I have one on the curved pipe base, one on a spike, and one on a base another now defunct plastic head came on."
4.0,"Work great if you have a lot of pressure. If you only have about 30-35 psi, forget it."
5.0,Very sturdy and durable and does a great job at watering a large portion of my yard that just had new sod placed. Place on top of Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base 58030 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S24U/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 and added a timer to automatically water my yard for me
5.0,"By far the most reliable, long lasting, and even-watering impact sprinkler made.  I replaced all the cheaper brands bought over the years which leak, get stuck, fail to reverse, or have broken in one way or another in normal use."
5.0,"Just awesome.  Set up on a 18"" pole and waters the yard as it should.  Adjustment holds, no issues with pattern or coverage area changing over time."
4.0,It is what I was looking for.
5.0,"They work Great, I bought three of them"
5.0,"Excellent coverage, good range with decent water pressure and very well made."
5.0,This is a great sprinkler head. Put it on and old base I had and works wonderful.
5.0,Great sprinkler.  I put it on the Orbit 1/2 Metal Ring Sprinkler Base 58030.
5.0,it's a Rainbird. Nothing to complain about.
5.0,Does its job
5.0,They work fantasti. Easy to use and set water spray pattern.
5.0,"It's great.  Rainbird had the marketfor many years until (apparently) their patent expired.  Then the cheap plastic imitators entered the market with their leaky junk.  We trashed a couple of them when we received and began to use this well-made (en Mexico) device.  It's made of metal and well-crafted. The only caveat is that this product does not include the spike to anchor it in the ground.  It appears it is meant to screw into an existing 1/2"" pipe already installed in the ground.  Fortunately, we were able to adapt it to the spike from one of the cheap products we trashed and it works fine.  My advice is to pay a bit more and get this well-made device."
1.0,"Can anyone out there help me?? I ordered this sprinkler based on the glowing reviews it got.  The second day of usage it stopped going back and forth and just stayed in one place, watering that one place!  When I looked it over and figured ok, I will just use this one to go around in the whole circle and flipped the paper clip looking thingy up, so it could go around and around it didn't!  It just stayed in one place. What am I doing wrong??  I really want this sprinkler to work.........do sprinklers need oil?"
5.0,"I have tried many of the impact sprinklers some brass and some just alloy. These are by far the best of any I have ever owned. The spray pattern is further that all the others, more precise, precise adjustability, etc."
5.0,"Brass and stainless construction. They are old school and proven by time. Solid built. Currently ""Made in Mexico"". If impact head is what you are looking for, this is a great buy."
4.0,"I like it, still trying to perfect the sprinkle mode. My wife thinks she does a better job."
5.0,"High quality materials.  I considered other more ""fancy"" sprinklers that were made out of plastic however I am very glad I went with this one.  I expect I will have this sprinkler for a very long time.  I has a lot of flexibility with regards to how far the spray goes.  It provides a nice even spray that will help make the lawn look great.  Nice job Rain Bird!"
4.0,"This item that I bought on Amazon, was great for what I wanted. I don't think I could do better? So go ahead and give it a change. SW"
5.0,"That's the sound of the official, rainbird sprinkler, the best watering system I've ever used.  Over 50 years.

 pfft  pfft  pfft  pfft  pfft  pfft  pfft  pfft  shooshooshooshooshoo

You hear it,  you""ll never forget it!"
2.0,I have some other rain bird sprinklers that I bought awhile back. They work a hell of a lot better than the new ones. The new ones turn to fast and I cannot get them to water only part of a circle. They just sit in one spot instead of reversing direction. Will not buy rain bird again if this is the best they can do.
5.0,"My wife and I just love those ""old-fashion"" brass sprinklers, and their, ""Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pffdfffdfffdfffdpfft"" sound. They do an excellent job of concentrating the water just where we want it and the sound harkens back to our youths."
4.0,"I replaced my older plastic sprinkler head with the Rain Bird copper head. What a difference, moves easier and has a larger spray area."
5.0,What a pain it is to get a sprinkler that does a good job and lasts.  After lots of plastic ones I decided to get two versions from Rain Bird.  This one is a fine metal one and has worked well for the larger of our two patches.  I also bought one of their plastic versions and that one has also worked well for the smaller of our two patches.
5.0,"Used these for years and years... unfortunately they are hard to find attached to a sprinkler base or sled anymore.  So we buy sprinklers with sleds, toss the head that came with it and attach these rain birds.  (reason is that most heads sold with sleds and bases do not work very long!).  Can't do without our rainbirds!  (and the Amazon price is really good!)"
5.0,Hard to beat for large coverage and ease of pattern adjustment in a standalone sprinkler. Works best with the Rain Bird base but also fits on other sprinkler bases as well. I would highly recommend it you are replacing broken head on a sprinkler of this type.
3.0,NOT VERY WELL BUILT AND THE SPRINKLER HEAD QUIT WORKING AFTER A FEW WEEKS SO I HAD TO PUT ON ANOTHER BETTER BUILT ONE.
5.0,The answer to my wife's landscaping dreams.  Our old sprinkler would stall because of our low water pressure.  Not this one.
5.0,I like this durable easy to use sprinkler.  I only got to use it for one season so I can't say for sure how well it holds up over time but so far I am very happy with it.
5.0,"Great sprinkler head.  You need good water pressure for these to work properly, but they'll last a long time because they're constructed with brass and won't corrode."
5.0,"Built good and works good,  the best type sprinkler made as they don't plug up....  Very good price on Amazon"
5.0,"OK, so I had my entire yard (very large) overseeded this fall, and I began to pull out and deploy the various sprinklers I've collected over the years.  My main sprinkler was a 3 foot tripod with an orbit sprinkler head, 1/2 inch impact.  After much fiddling, I could never get it to recirculate, so I replaced the head with a Gilmour head that I had from another sprinkler. It worked fine, but the spray pattern and water delivery was definitely not as robust as I needed. Knowing that I needed a replacement head anyway (as I need to deploy all my equipment), I headed to Amazon to see what was available. After seeing the reviews for this rainbird head (which is typically not available at the big box stores), I decided to give it a try.  I installed it today, and BOY, what a difference! Definitely the cadillac of sprinkler heads. Two things stand apart: One, it dispurses water way more effectively than the other two (spray pattern is better). Two, the impact cadence (speed of rotation) is faster - both of which mean you're getting more water where you need it in a shorter period of time. When you have several sprinklers that you have to set up on timers so they're not on at the same time, that's important. I was so impressed I just ordered two more to replace the heads on my other sprinklers - I don't want to sound like a rainbird homer, but there's no comparison."
5.0,"Again, I've had it with plastic heads that break.  Spent a little more and got this RainBird.  Put it on a pole base that's easy to move and have been very pleased. It gives good coverage."
5.0,"I have a number of plastic Rain Birds and they generally do the job. I feel that the brass Rain Birds I just bought are worth the extra money. It seems as though they have more mass and are less likely to get ""hung up"" watering one spot than the plastic version."
5.0,I believe from previous experience that Rain Bird is by far a superior product compared to others on the market.  This head works flawlessly and should last for years.  For anyone interested they do make one that cost a little more and goes a little further in distance.  For us this product was perfect.
4.0,"Item as described, well made of quality materials, installed easily and I expect it to perform for years without problems. Far superior to the plastic products sold at most retailers these days at similar cost."
1.0,"I've bought metal, plastic, ...($3 - $25) every kind!  None work after 3 times!

SO .. I called 'help line' to ask if they make a specific impact nozzle for low pressure.  'Help Line' charges $10 for ANY answer - they get name and cc# before even a general ? .. BS; I just wanted to know if they manufacture a product that is designed for low-pressure.  THAT ENDS MY RAINBIRD PURCHASES OF ANY KIND.

I must run 200' of garden hose from my frost-free hydrant for a sprinkler .. I water 1 acre and I want large radius so it can run for 3-4 hours without me having to change positions.

Anyone have suggestions?  I'm evadu at yahoo dot com.  One forum suggested P2-R .. and I learned that it had been discontinued."
1.0,"I was disconnected four times today.  I bought this sprinkler head and worked for two hours trying to get it to work.  then I discovered it was missing a trip pin, part 105720, (a tiny cotter pin).  I cannot order it on Rainbirds website, nor will they pick up the phone.  I have spent 4 hours now on one product, trying to get it work, looking up the problem and trying to connect with Rainbird.  Pretty outrageious really."
5.0,"These sprinkler heads are well made, very functional and easy to use; changing the settings is quite simple; highly recommended"
2.0,It just does not perform as good as older heads.  Too many places where water pools instead of being more finely broadcast.
5.0,"I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation."
5.0,"We have an old metal Rain Bird with WHEELS and when the sprinkler part went bad, I looked everywhere to replace the whole unit. Thank you Amazon, you have EVERYTHING! We're back in business."
1.0,had to return this item.  had to figure out how to get the range that you want and the output was disapointing as well.  Sent it back after the first day.
5.0,"We have unfiltered irrigation water - and the sprinkler heads get clogged with weeds, etc.  This one seems to be more tolerant of that - and it really has a reach for distance.  Good weight also helps keep the sprinkler in place"
4.0,I rated this sprinkler before I actually TRIED to use it. I installed it on three different bases and it would not work. I'm very disappointed because I've used rain Bird sprinklers in the past and they have always been excellent.  I could not figure out why it wouldn't work. Do not buy this sprinkler.
5.0,"Easy to adjust, big drops of water don't evaporate as fast.  Quality construction, easy to clean if bug get inside"
5.0,"I really like this sprinkler. It works great, the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would. Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long. I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality. Kind of rare now days."
5.0,"I bought this one, liked it so much I bought another one. Like most people, all I want is a product that does the job and will last long enough to make the price worth it. Now that's not too much to ask. Like lots of other people, I'm sick of buying disposable sprinklers that don't tell you that they're disposable, nor are they priced like it. All different types of sprinklers use a certain method to distribute the water. But it doesn't matter if the cheap product breaks. And metal to plastic connections WILL break sooner than later. So all-metal looks like the best option. paired with the Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base 58030, I'm optimistic this tandem will last."
5.0,"Works Great.  Well built, gets the job done.  For the size of my yard all I have to do is place it in the center and let the sprinkler do the rest."
4.0,I love the universal sprinkler head replacement.  They install easily and have a much better spraying radius than the originals.  The adjustments are not as solid as the Melnor 3900H but they work fine.
3.0,"My adjustment pens got warped.  Don't get me wrong it's a great sprinkler, but some rubber ends on those adjustable pins would make them so much easier to adjust and grab.  They are like barbed wire and moving them is painful on the fingers."
2.0,I liked that they are all metal and seem to be sturdy.  I had only one going at a time and they worked fine for a couple of waterings.  Then for some reason they would not rotate.
5.0,"If you have a lawn and don't have one of these, you're missing out.

This is a superior sprinkler head - it's the most effect one I've every seen.  Works really well with yard buttler s-11 stand."
3.0,"I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinkler

Pros: Solid build, strong material construction, quick performer, very easy to adjust the spray pattern.

Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price, I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.

Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird, youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one."
2.0,"I run a bunch of Orbit's 1/2 & 3/4"" sprinklers on a ditch pump. The 3/4 size is great but I've had nothing but headaches with the 1/2 size. They frequently hang up and won't turn, even with a clear nozzle and strong pressure. So far I haven't found a fix."
5.0,"I bought 4 plastic impact sprinklers from my local big box store after re-seeding my lawn. After just one week, two of them were broken - one would not advance properly and the other began leaking from the hose attachment to the point of flooding my lawn where it was placed. I purchased 4 of these to replace them and wish I would have just bought these in the first place. The plastic ones had two zones: one area where the ""main"" jet of water landed (the outer radius), and the area where the water splashed from the impact arm action. The area between the two received very little water. These sprinklers however provide a very nice even watering pattern. Using these to begin with would probably have saved me some money as the grass seed in the old no-water zone has since died. I'll now have to over-seed again!

The only negative is adjusting these results in me getting quite wet. The additional mass of the metal impact arm makes a very fine spray that soaks things in the immediate vicinity. However this is also what makes for such even water distribution, so I will not  withhold any stars, especially considering it's a one-time set and forget operation."
5.0,"Very easy to adjust and set up, perfect for my large yard.  I've ordered two of these and two of the Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base 58030.  I should have been using this combo for the ten years I've been in this house.  Better late than never.  You won't be sorry with this purchase.
UPDATE May 1, 2013: The second one I ordered refuses to reverse direction. I've compared the two sprinklers side by side, and can see no physical difference between the two.  After reviewing the website and reading the on-line owner's manual, I was still unable to get it to work.  I will be returning the second one for a replacement."
5.0,The original plastic one that came with the Rain bird did not hold up and this one is metal.  I'm very happy with it.
5.0,"It takes a little practice learning how to set this sprinkler head up to cover the ground you want watered, but who doesn't like getting a little wet on a hot summer day? Ha! Actually, it is simple to adjust this sprinkler head once you do it a time or two. The coverage is excellent. It works best on large yards since water pressure activates it, and it doesn't function well with low water pressure."
4.0,"Feels durable and well made.  Don't know about a 40 ft radius, but it probably would do that if elevated on a tripod. One simple quirk, mine tends to need a relatively high flow rate to start/continue to oscillate. If you reduce the flow to shorten the throw it may freeze or advance intermittently.  At plus 50% flow it works fine.  Also helps to lubricate moving parts with a little silicone grease when stored over several months.  Guess it helps reduce oxidation."
5.0,"I've had other brands of sprinkler heads, and they all seemed to wear out prematurely, didn't adjust properly or any number of other things.  I purchased my first one of these, and liked it so much that I purchased another when I had another Amazon.com order ready.

Good coverage, no assembly other than mounting it on the stand.  Appears to be well made.  My broccoli,"
5.0,"The metal Rain Birds are the best sprinklers I have ever used for large areas.  They are sturdy and well made.  The country of origin is Mexico not the USA.  In the case of this sprinkler the quality of the item is first class.  Very well made and well assembled parts.  These sprinklers are vastly more durable to most cheap plastic rain bird clones.  IMHO.

One thing to keep in mind if you buy one of these is that there is a rotating part that goes in the connector you screw it into.  You need to make sure that part does not scuff the edges of the connector.  I found that when I bought the Butler stand to mount this sprinkler on the supplied plastic part did not work well.  I had to get a metal coupling from the hardware store to get the Rain Bird to rotate freely."
5.0,"This is a great replacement sprinkler head! GOes back and forth like its on turbo, and is supposed to last longer than other brands! Love it! Want more!"
5.0,"IMO, the gold standard in impact sprinklers.  Buy one (OK maybe four) and be done with it.
Rain Bird has built this right for decades and it's a wonder why so many other companies cheapen this simple design."
5.0,"All brass construction and high quality make this a great replacement
sprinkler head. Reliable and easy to adjust. Will buy more next season."
4.0,Perfect replacement for an old damaged sprinkler head
5.0,These items were returned to the seller..
2.0,"Can't go wrong with RainBird, right?

Very disappointed - leaked all over the place, won't pop up at all. Replaced with the RainBird 1800 series which are a bit pricier and they worked fine - no leaks whatsoever.
Had to readjust all the risers since the 1800 are taller... such a waste of time."
5.0,Works great and covers a fifteen foot radius. I purchased the 180 degree and 360 degree at the same time good well built product
1.0,"Water leaks from all sides, also found them to be very cheaply made. Already found one cracked and they've only been in a week"
4.0,"Used as replacement heads in lawn area where center sprinklers and no perimeter heads were present. There are substantial dry areas around the edges, but that's the way this design functions."
1.0,"Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers. I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years. Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately, any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs. I've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers."
1.0,"Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers. I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years. Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately, any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs. I've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers."
2.0,"I equipped my entire, three-zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers. They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.

Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals."
5.0,working great.
5.0,They make a great replacement for my old Rain Jet sprinklers as they wear out
5.0,This is just the sprinkler head I needed to replace one hit by a mower.  I could not fine it at local hardware stores. The one I ordered is placed in the center of the grass strip between the curb and sidewalk and covers a rectangular area.  Most other outlets sell  heads to place along the side of the rectangle.
5.0,arrived on time and works as represented.
5.0,Works great and covers a fifteen foot radius.
5.0,"Brand new, excellent..."
5.0,Great product!
5.0,Just as described
4.0,Item good to replace my rainjet square heads. I wish rainjet was still around!
5.0,This Rain Bird square pop sprinkler is just what we needed and works just fine. It's getting more difficult to find these in our area so I was thrilled to find them online. We've had no problems at all with it and installed it easily and quickly.
5.0,Worked as I expected.  I needed this to for a corner area area of my lawn.  I wish it had better ability to adjust the distance it sprays to but overall I am happy with the product.
5.0,"Will buy again, great shipping speed."
3.0,Leaks after shut off But it will do.
5.0,"Good deal, item as described, thank you."
1.0,"The square nozzle on this sprinkler head does not work as advertised. The Nozzle Performance Chart on the Rain Bird website indicates that this nozzle with throw a 23' x 23' square pattern with 30 psi and 3.37 gpm. Yea, right. We are running a flat elevation system at 80 psi and 12 gpm and the maximum number of square nozzle sprinkler heads that this amount of pressure and flow will activate properly is one. Useless."
5.0,This was easier to install than expected even though there are many different sizes and styles to choose from.
5.0,"Too fast, excelent!"
5.0,"This sprayer is just what I was looking for.  A good, high quality sprayer made of steel with a brass wand and heavy duty hose.  I have already used it for several different jobs and it works perfectly.  I can see it lasting for a long time as opposed to the cheap plastic ones that I have purchased in the past.  It is well worth the investment."
5.0,"It is a joy to use!!  It works so smoothly and does what it is said to do.
Thanks, Chapin!!!"
5.0,This root feeder helped save my chitalpa trees!  Using it to apply deep watering with fertilizer has reduced the pine needle droppage from my mondale pine trees.  Even my elderly pyracantha shows healthy improvement.  I'm impressed!
5.0,"I live in Dallas, TX so this heat down here in tough on trees. I had a Magnolia tree brought in in May and the heat nearly got it, but getting water right to the roots saved it in my opinion. You don't waste water, the water gets right to the roots."
5.0,"> The ""old"" version of this product was made of cast metal with a glass globe. The ""new"" version (this version) is all plastic.  Isn't that the progression of many products now adays.  Regardless, this product works well and is worth the money.

> A little trick to insert the root feeder into hard soil - Touch the tip to the ground, turn the water on, and slowly start pushing.  Once you've penetrated the soil, you may need to pull it back a little then keep pushing.

> Recommendation, go ahead and buy a box of fertlizer tablets while you are buying this root feeder."
5.0,Item arrived on time and does what I wanted it to do.  My trees look better already.
1.0,"Don't believe this product was made to last more than one season! I've had several of these and they don't seem to last for more than one summer.

The root feeder, or metal portion that gets inserted into the ground naturally rusts quickly, and begins to soften. So taking it out and moving it say around to the other side of the tree, and it will bend very easily.

At the end is 5 holes, 4 outward, (such as north, south, east, & west), and one straight downward. Once you get past the soft top layer of soil, chances are as you go deeper you will hit clay, or harder soil.

Not is it only hard to push into the soil, but most of the time the holes will clog with clay or mud. So what I've had to do was turn the water on full, then push it down a few inches at a time until you get it all the way in.

Then pull it back out and most of the time clean out the holes with a twig or something, then reinsert it, (trying to find the original hole, which is all mud now).

Pulling it out, is no easy task either! Best have a strong back...

The one I have now was purchased last summer, and it's not looking like I'm going to be able to use it this summer. Water is leaking through several holes in the cheap plastic handle.

I would not recommend it!"
4.0,"This product is great for delivering water directly to the root zone. That's where the roots are. So, this product puts water right where it is needed most. I used to water my trees with my garden hose from the top like everybody else. It took a lot of time and I never knew for sure if the water was going down to the roots. Now I know the water is going down to the roots because I put the tip of this device into the soil and down around the roots. Then I turn on the water and my tree(s) say, ""Thanks, I was very thirsty. You are the best caretaker ever."". That makes me feel good to know that my trees appreciate my efforts. My neighbors are jealous because they don't know why my trees look better than theirs. I'm not going to tell them my secret because I don't really like my neighbors very much."
3.0,"I live at the edge of the Mojave dessert in California. The soil is very poor. There is topsoil down to about 6 inches, then a 12 inch layer of ""Calichi"" (hardpan), then silty soil below that. Water does not penetrate the calichi layer. I have grass planted with a sprinkler system. When the sprinklers go on, the soil becomes saturated quickly because surface water does not penetrate the calichi layer. Trees planted in the lawn do not get enough water. The root feeder is the perfect tool to water trees by getting water below the calichi layer. The root feeder will not by itself penetrate the calichi layer so I first have to prepare a hole by driving a 3/8 reinforcing bar into the ground to get past the calichi layer. I then withdraw the re-bar and insert the root feeder. My one complaint is that the threads conecting the plastic handle to the metal rod are too fine, and as a result, after much use the rod separates from the plastic handle. I solve this problem by wrapping the rod threads with Teflon tape."
5.0,"I wouldn't have anything else but one of these.  I've had one before, and ""ex"" got it.  I want to conserve water when watering my plants, not watch it run down in to the street, and this gives my plants the good watering they need in the ""spot"" they need it...the roots!"
4.0,"I have been using ""cheaper) sprayer for years now and just woke up. The Chapin is well the money. It gives an even spray at much less effort. Our driveway looks ten times better now. Would have rated it a FIVE Star if it had a strap to carry it. It is well built and well made."
1.0,"Plastic pieces broke after 6 uses (low-impact uses). Doesn't hold any seal anymore. Seriously, don't buy this. I should have listened to the other negative reviews."
5.0,"What a great quality product!  Something that will likely last a long time.
When I opened the box, I notice I was missing a ""bonus"" package of extra nozzles.  I called the manufacturer and they promptly sent them to me.  Great product, and great customer service."
5.0,Best price and fast shipping! Works GREAT!
4.0,I sprayed my porch and sidewalk one time with sealer and cleaned my Chapin sprayer. Sprayed nice and cleaned up easy. We will see if it holds up in the long run.
5.0,very good product however it was still missing the shoulder strap the second time around
5.0,"I have bought a number of cheap plastic sprayers which either did not work out of the box, or worked for a few months and quit. Most of these would not seal at the fill plug. This sprayer is far sturdier, and appears as thought it will last for years. Can't say for sure, of course, but at least it is well-made. It is heavier to carry around, but if that is the price for having a sprayer that actually works, it is worth it."
1.0,Wand leaks from trigger. Brass nozzle sprays inconsistently. Returned
5.0,Very high quality for the price
5.0,"Works great for the price. We use it for clear liquid release on stamp projects, and it works well even when we tint the release."
5.0,After trying so many plastic one finally I got this very reliable heavy duty very good to use it
2.0,Keeps vloaking the sprayer
1.0,"I purchased this item to seal my stamped concrete. Half way through the job the plunger leaked. I checked the seal, cleaned the bottom of the plunger and can. I couldn't get it to not to leak air when pressurized. I thought buying this brand was the right choice it was not. The result was after trying to fix the unit now the material clogged the made the unit useless. It is now in the garbage can. Disappointed to say the least."
5.0,Using it for spraying concrete stains and sealer.  Works good.
5.0,"This works great for spraying compost tea.  It is super easy to clean and holds over 3 gallons, so you can spray over 1200 sqft of plants without having to fill up. Assembly instruction were a little complicated, but you can use it for spraying many different products.  The nozzle holder will fall off in the garden, so leave it inside and not mounted on the spray hose."
5.0,"So far I have used this 3x and I love the way it pumps easily, holds a tight seal of the pressure inside and the way it sprays.  Some have said that it's heavy, but I've had units which were much heavier.  Hey!  It's got 2 or 3 of gallons of liquid in it and when it's full, it's going to have some weight to it.  Empty, I think it's very light."
5.0,"Sturdy construction, would recommend this anyone."
4.0,"Excellent performance. Was fed up with small plastic units that were a pain. This is a solid unit that should last for years,  Would like to see a pressure relief valve rather than run off pressure through hose."
3.0,sadly no strap which it shows in pictures
5.0,Very good!!!
3.0,works well but requires modification to stop terrible leaks or will spray in face!
5.0,"I use these (i have 3) to water the roots of my trees and some other plants. No wasting water in the air where it can evaporate - I can flood the roots if a tree gets too dry, and put the water exactly where its needed. In this semi-arid climate, its important not to waste water during the hot summer months. Smaller plants are easy to replace (especially if neighbors have some that they can share), but trees take so long to grow here that they get special attention. I have two younger trees that get special watering treatments as their roots are not so deep that they can reach the water well below the surface. Works wonders on perking up wilted trees in 100+ degree days."
4.0,This was a gift
5.0,Bought this after seeing my landscaper use it to deep water new transplants. Makes sense and a new hedgerow seems to have taken nicely before the cold set in.
1.0,I had an older one for years.  This one makes a mess with water comming out the top.  Buy the more expensive one.  The cheaper one is not worth it.
5.0,Works great for fertilizing.
5.0,Works as advertised for deep watering and feeding of trees.
1.0,Garbage. Leaked everywhere
2.0,"Loved the application concept. It worked successfully for 10 trees for me. After that, I found the nozzle tip was worn out 50% and made the hole 50 times the size of what it was. So, it lost the water pressure. I returned it successfully. I would definitely buy it IF it comes with a durable nozzle tip."
4.0,OK
5.0,"Works a lot better than the plastic ones when using certain chemicals. It wasn't too expensive, priced just right."
5.0,Super well made.
3.0,Leaks around top seal
5.0,"I bought this in the hopes that I'd be able to more efficiently wash my vehicle in my town home, where I have no access to a hose. Living in the northeast, with salt on the roads frequently, I like to keep the salt off the car to prevent rust. I bought this product in an attempt to allow me to wash my car in the driveway, without a hose. For that, it works great.

The metal tip works similar to something like a Rubbermaid spray bottle, where the tighter it is, the more spread the spray pattern is. As you loosen it you get a more focused beam. I'm able to get some quite respectable power behind the beam to knock off dirt and grime, and the long wand allows me to point under my vehicle to knock out any accumulation there.

I mix in a non-sudsy car wash soap into the tank (optimum no rise) and mix that up. For this purpose, it's excellent, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who needs to be able to wash their vehicles far from a hose, or on the go."
5.0,Best weed sprayer I've ever used. Holds pressure for a long time and is not very heavy.  I'd by this over the plastic ones any day.
5.0,Great product! This is my 2nd one. It lasted a long time.
5.0,Work great
4.0,It works.... but the nozzles and pieces shipped loose in the box and there is no strap to carry the sprayer included.
5.0,Highest quality sprayer that  I have found. I am very pleased.
5.0,This sprayer is a little heavy but I should have expected this since it is metal. Very easy to use. We like very much.
4.0,Good quality as I expected.
5.0,"Great product, exactly as described. Good steel tank which will last forever.  I will replace the sprayer with an RV shower head and use this as a camp shower!  You can pour hot water in it, add some cold to get the temperature right, pump it up and presto, great shower out in the woods after a hot, sweaty day.  The 3.5 gallon capacity will easily allow two showers without refilling."
4.0,Good unit but sprayer wand was slightly bent and crimped.
2.0,stopped working after 2 months
1.0,"Product sprung a pressure leak *11 days* after the 30-day return period expired (April 24th). Okay, that's their return policy. But it seems wrong that there is nothing we can do to exchange it for a non-faulty unit.

If you only need this for less than 1 month, it's a great product."
4.0,"Quality sprayer, with copper fittings and a nice fine spray. Works quite well, way better then the plastic junk on the market."
5.0,"The best sprayer I've ever had, well built, nothing cheap about this sprayer, should last a long time! For the money that I've spent on a variety of plastic ones I wish I had bought this one first, would of saved a few bucks. The only draw back is if you fill it to the fill mark it gets a little heavy at first."
5.0,"Good overall quality.  Heads and shoulders better than the crap from the big box stores.  This sprayer should last a long time
if you take care of it properly.  Good quality all around."
4.0,"We used it to spray termite pesticide, and it work great. Easy to use, good quality."
5.0,Works as it should and in this day and age that's saying something.
4.0,"I have used this feeder on several new trees I have planted this year.  It has been a hot and dry September in the Midwest and is nice to soak the root ball when needed.  The feeder seems to work well, will have to wait and see if it holds up to use as the plastic doesn't seem very heavy duty."
1.0,"Had the more expensive ""HD"" version for a few years until the plastic hose coupling wore and it leaked a lot. This economy model is a POS. No hose coupling so you have to turn the entire device to fasten the hose. There's a plastic on/off lever that stuck in the open position after a few uses. Very little water flow--tried to clean out the holes by tapping the end on the ground as I did with the other one, but still not working. Tried to do the right thing by contacting the company first because of their ""one year limited warranty,"" but never heard back.
Don't do it."
5.0,In Arizona desert soften soil before using. Works well when inserted
5.0,Amazing watering gadget worked really good
5.0,Tabs dissolve much faster in this feeder vs the small Ross feeder.
5.0,WORKS WELL
5.0,"Works like a charm-gets water deep go my River Butch, Dogwood & 6 white Arborvitae. ."
5.0,Are used one of these years ago and was so tickled to find one again. It reaches down deep to not only watering my trees but to enrich them with the fertilizer.
5.0,My soil is dry right now so it only took about 5 minutes to dissolve the tablets and inject the roots. Very efficient. My mother used to use these back in the day. It a great way to control the depth you water to and there is no waste through evaporation. I'm very pleased!
5.0,"I had an older Ross Root feeder several years ago, but lost in in a home move. The old one was built like a tank - all metal - tough as nails and I thought I might regret getting this newer model. The head of the unit is all plastic and I was skeptical that it would last, but I needed to feed some citrus trees in my yard. The new feeder arrived and I'm impressed. Yes, the unit is plastic, but it is sold and sturdy. I've had to really lean on this to get it to penetrate some dry patches around my trees and there is no sign of weakness or bending. The cup for inserting fertilizer tabs is larger than on my old unit and the whole unit reeks of quality and endurance."
4.0,Like this product a lot. Helps out a lot in terms of watering my trees in the summer time.
1.0,After about 4 months use the gasket failed and will not work without spraying water everywhere. Worked ok at first but eventually became useless.
5.0,I have several of these and all are great.
5.0,Excellent watering tool for young trees to get them started and not die during hot and dry days in the summer.
4.0,"A little smaller than what I had purchased in the past for other brands, but it works quite well"
1.0,Right out of the box I hooked up this item to a hose and turned on the water. Instead of the water coming out of the tube into the ground it went out through the two slots in the handle. No point in trying to contact the manufacturer because trying to contact them is a more faulty system than the product.
5.0,"I live in a very hot, dry area and yes... my trees and larger bushes are coming back to life."
5.0,"For those of us who have large trees, big roots, this is great to get some water under the top say 6' of soil.  My 5 giant greet thujas sit next to a 10' concrete swimming pool, and that exacerbates root problems but the trees are great privacy.  Not only can you use fertilizer pellets in these, but you can also just run it with water dripping......slow dripping is best for all big trees.  Just be careful not to force the shaft into the ground, do it easily, because I did break one.  Not a professional treatment, but I paid $250 to do my 5 trees last year.  So I could break a few and still be a happy camper."
2.0,single ejection port at tip minimally useful - needs multiple ports/holes for optimal watering
5.0,Really makes a difference.
5.0,Very effective and you can buy all the replacement parts from them on the cheap with no strings attached.
5.0,Excellent Root Feeder.
3.0,"Great concept.  But the crust of the Earth can be hard.  My mother's old unit, which I use, has outlasted 3 of the modern ones.  Why, WHY, is the tiny ""tip of the spear"" made of such soft, cheap, pot metal?  After the tip on my first Ross ""Heavy Duty"" Feeder failed on me, I blamed myself, thinking I just pushed it too heavy, strong, into hard ground.  So I bought a second one and watered first with an sprinkler, then pushed lighter, softer - and the tip failed again, almost just as fast.  Because I still have about six boxes of the various, excellent, fertilizer cartridges sitting on my garage shelf, I may have to buy a third one, so that my investment in the fertilizer is not wasted.  Mr. Brightside says buying this unit over and over is still cheaper than hiring a tree guy.  That's why I give this three stars, not fewer."
4.0,Works
5.0,"Works as advertised ,"
4.0,Pretty awesome!  I've seen a huge improvement in my trees which had some crazy leaf drop and looked dead..
5.0,"I really like the Root Feeder Heavy Duty Model.  I have planted numerous trees in heavy clay soil and they were doing very poorly.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get the feeder into my soil, but was able to do so.  Now that there is a couple of feeding holes around each tree it is a breeze.  I have only had this for a couple of weeks, but my trees are doing much better than before in our extreme summer heat.  I also use it for watering and feeding my larger plants or shrubs.  It is definitely saves on water.  It appears to be well made - no problems at all."
1.0,"Leaks, it worst than the metal one I have from 20 years ago.. I would have thought they would have improved it.."
5.0,Excellent quality
5.0,"I live in Northwest Kansas and it can get very dry here during the summer, the root feeder is great but you must have good water pressure to make it work as its intended."
1.0,"Item stopped functioning only after a few uses. It began leaking water from area where hose is connected, the on/off switch would not work, and water would not come out of the tip/spear. Very bad quality."
4.0,"Was not able to find in my area this the second one I have Owen works good for
 me"
5.0,this is a good product. It works great. Amazon was $15.00 less than the local garden store.
5.0,Awesome product. Gets the water straight to the roots.
5.0,"I have always used this root feeder to feed my trees!  Also, I use it to deep water my lawn when it is very dry!"
3.0,"This did the job perfectly. However, it leaked from a spot where there was no access for repair, so I had to return it."
5.0,works great -  shrubs and trees are loving it -  well made
4.0,"Bought my first Ross Root Feeder #1200 over 30 years ago..... Finally had to replace it.  While this new one has more plastic components, it also has some additional features.  Looking forward to 30 more years of healthy trees."
5.0,"Works great.  However, I wish their was a super tough all metal model as i was afraid sometimes i was going to bend it or crack it going into my hard clay."
5.0,Excellent product
5.0,"Just what I needed! I have pets in my backyard and didn't want to risk with granules on the soil. So I purchased this root feeder. I push it deep enough in the soil so the 'fertilized' water doesn't come up! It's sturdy and does its job really well.

Recently I used granules to root feed my avocado, instead of Ross tablets. I poured the granules into the fertilizer chamber. Made a mistake by not cleaning the granules off the rim where you close the chamber with the plastic top. So water was spilling out of the chamber. Learned. Lesson #2, granules didn't dissolve in a long time, so at the end I dumped them. Make sure you clean the fertilizer chamber well and there is no granule residue. I think next time I'll try to mash the granules into sand... maybe that will dissolve."
3.0,"broke at the yellow part near the hose connector, after two years, have EMAILED and phoned JOBES to use warrenty, no luck. Have 3 of these, great when they work,"
5.0,I love it
4.0,"Feeders are an important irrigation tool. We had problems with this one because it's not heavy-duty enough to handle our needs. We have issues with roots and compacted soil that this model can't handle. Also our soil is sandy - which makes it drain well, but the holes in the tip clog up in spots where it can penetrate."
5.0,I've had both of these and they work. My plants look good when I keep up the fertilizing. Thanks!
5.0,I'm using this device to inject water into large compost piles. It also can be used to inject high nitrogen poultry pellets and blood meal into the compost as well.
4.0,Works ok but breaks easily
5.0,This thing is a WINNER!  I've used this product for several years.  Just had to replace my old one with a new one.  My plants and trees are way ahead of my neighbors' who don't use Ross deep root feeding.
5.0,"I have used it in 2016 fall, yet to see the results. However it was very easy to use after a couple of tries. I was able to reach good depth with the water turned which loosens up the soil and then it sinks easily with a little pressure."
5.0,"Works as expected, get deep in the roots.  Not cheaply built."
3.0,"I really like  the Ross Rootfeeder with one MAJOR exception.  That dinky little plastic (black) knob with an even dinkier little screw in it is what is used to turn the water on & off -- and you must do that every time you move the feeder which is REALLY often going around the drip line of each tree.  That little plastic knob is the achilles heel of this product.  The tiny little screw goes only about 1/4 inch into a plastic (the entire root feeder is plastic) hole.  It does not take very many times turning the water on & off & the screw has stripped the plastic.  You are then forced to keep constant pressure on the knob/screw to insure it does not fall out.  Zoom in on the little black knob (right side of feeder before the black attachment for the hose) & you will see exactly what I mean.  I thought of giving the rating of 1 star, but I really like the feeder except for this one feature. & it is a killer problem."
5.0,Best thing to use on small fruit trees. Right to the root is what matters.
5.0,"I always wanted to try it so when it was on sale, I bought it. Best way to water all my shrubs, trees and plants. This is a must have in any home"
5.0,Great product. Works well
5.0,Now this is a handy little tool.  Well made and feels very sturdy.  Used it about 40 times now and it still works like new.
4.0,Easy to use and seems to work well.  Would purchase again.
5.0,"LOVE this product!! What a great way to deep water plants and save water. My trees came back to life after a couple of deep, slow drip, watering sessions."
5.0,Great product
3.0,"It works fine but it's SLOW to fertilize even an eight foot tree. You need 1 fertilizer ""pill"" for every 2 feet of tree, so an 8' tree needs 4 pills. It takes 10-15 minutes to dissolve each pill, so expect to spend about an hour/tree."
5.0,This is the second one I've gotten over a period of about 12 years.  They are well built and last.
5.0,If you have new trees (or even existing ones) this is awesome.  Works phenomenally.
5.0,The little tree out from is smiling due to the regular watering.
3.0,Works Great
2.0,very flimsy for the price
5.0,"Very well made and did the trick saving our fruit trees during the continuing CA drought. It is easy to use, no leaks and quite sturdy. I was worried about the long metal tube but it turned out to be more than sufficient when pressing into hard dirt. The fertilizer feeding feature is really cool, saved our acid loving trees."
5.0,These are the best tool you can have for watering trees and shrubs deeply and quickly.
5.0,"I had never heard of this before until I saw it here on Amazon.  I needed a way to do some deep watering and feeding some nutrients for a wilting tree during the hot California summer days.  This worked great.  I ended up feeding lots of other trees just to get the nutrients into the soil. It's also good to use without adding any nutrients. Our soil is so dry and digging a hole is like trying to dig through a rock that it is almost impossible to dig a hole when trying to plant anything -- especially larger 5-gallon shrubs.  I've tried to just get the soil wet ahead of time but it never penetrates deep enough or the water runs every where except where it is needed.  Running sprinklers ends up getting a larger than needed area just too wet.  This works like magic.  Sometimes I use the fertilizer sticks and other times I don't bother since I'm purchasing good garden soil for planting.  What I do is soak the area with this very slowly a few days before planting and it makes the area soft enough to dig easily without making it too wet where it becomes a big muddy clump of dirt.  I just do it a few days in advance of planting.  And the area around the new planting now has some moisture for root growth rather than being rock solid and when I add some food to it, the soil now has valuable nutrients.  So simple to use -- attach to your hose, slowly insert into the ground and you are done."
5.0,Works great.
4.0,It does the job
5.0,"Awesome tool to feed the tree's roots. However, don't use it with miracle grow pellet plant food, the feeding tube gets clogged up. Definitely use the Ross feeder sticks. The work great and dissolve perfectly (and very quickly)."
5.0,"Solid construction, easy to use. I've had it about 3 months now and it's holding up just fine. Even the instructions are good - they explain how to get the tip of the unit deep into the dirt to reach the roots. Piece of cake."
1.0,It worked great the first time I used it. Now it won't work at all. There seems to be a problem between where the water hose connects and where the fertilizer goes. Water isn't getting to the fertilizer. It only sprays out the slotted sides. Don't recommend.
2.0,Not heavy duty at all.and when the earth is a tad dry this falls apart when you try to dig it in deep..
5.0,great for getting down deep to the larger roots and to encourage deep root growth
1.0,Purchased 1200C heavy duty root feeder from Amazon 7 months ago. Only Ross fertilizer has been used to feed 12-15 trees once per month. The tip on the steel feed tube has already disintegrated and needs replacement.  I have contacted the company regarding replacement under warranty and am awaiting their reply.
5.0,This is a great way to keep your big trees and bushes happy during the hot season without having to run your sprinklers and waste water.  You can pretty easily target the water to particular plants and let the hose run for a few mins until the ground is nice and saturated.  You can usually tell because the water will start bubbling up
5.0,Works well as described
5.0,Glad to have replacement root feeder......really helps summer stressed shrugs and trees. Trees and plants are happy.
5.0,"Great product...I was worried about the plastic handles being sturdy enough, but hasn't been an issue, they are plenty solid enough to get this into the ground.  And the side holes in the tip are key, don't get plugged when pushing it into the ground."
5.0,"We are in a drought, which means that no matter how much you water the trees on the surface, deep below at the roots water is being drawn off by the grass and other plants. This system allows me to get water and fertilizer immediately down to the roots."
4.0,"Besides the picture being wrong, I liked this tool - it's hard to use for a long time, but it's a good workout!  Thinking about saving up to get one of the European styles next!"
4.0,It works as it should. It has a good weight to it and I like the fact that you have multiple blade angle options.
5.0,"This Snath has REVERSED threads on the handles.  Righty tighty, lefty loosy in reverse!  Once you figure that out, it is easy to adjust the handles to your needs.  Just love it!"
4.0,"the Seymour Mfg. SN-1 Steel Clad Snath is well made... just wish the handles were more easily adjustable, the balance is good, overall I'm pleased with the workmanship..."
3.0,"The quality of finish was a little weak. The handle adjustment was not easy; I had to really crank on them to set the position, and the range of adjustment was not as wide as I would like. Once set up, the balance and weight are fine. No trouble with strength/durability yet :)"
5.0,"OK.  Did you really know the handle for a scythe was called a ""snath?""  I sure didn't.  Why was I looking for one?  If you've got a doomsday-prepper mentality, one of the things I've never heard mentioned is that if gas becomes a scarce commodity you're not going to be able to keep the homestead whacked for varmint control, visibility, or just plain neatness.  A scythe will fix that, and this handle is -- as far as I can tell -- best in class.  If you get your stuff at the local hardware store, I'd urge you to stop buying the Chinese junk and get something substantial.  Like this.  It's better looking, easier to use, far better quality, and built to last a lifetime.  Break three or four of your pieces of assembly line junk -- you'll spend more money in the long run and I'll still be whacking away with this one.  If you think planning ahead and creating contingencies for catastrophic situations is a little bit out there, then this makes a great tool for finishing up the edge trimming early in the morning without upsetting the neighbors.  Or saving money on gas.  Or having the coolest tool in the neighborhood.  If you're an honest-to-goodness hard-working farmer or rancher, I apologize for the urban commentary, but you more than anyone should go with a Seymour.  You have too much hard work in your life to be running back and forth for more snaths. [ASIN:B00002NCFX Seymour Wood Snath (SN-1)]"
1.0,I have now red the previous reviews of the item so i guess i have myself to blame. Handles do not turn as tey supposed and you can not change or tighten them. Can not be used in the state it had been shipped. Screws from the handles had been shaved off. It is not usable
5.0,Just what I needed for my new trees.
5.0,"Works good and very sturdy, even if not made of metal and glass like 25 tears ago.  Hard to find, but I knew I would find it on Amazon!"
5.0,Works great for watering my thirsty weeping willow tree; very sturdy and seems like it will last a long time.
4.0,Very needed in California draught.
5.0,"I've used this feeder and refills to good effect in both central TX and central CT. Damaged and/or dying trees often revive after a few feedings of the water-borne fertilizer.

A couple of notes of caution - If the soil is very hard or very dry use a piece of rebar to make the feeding hole and put the feeder in that. The feeder has a spear tip on it but I hesitate to pound it into the ground. Also, if the fertilizer  mix comes up out of the ground, slow the water to keep it at the root level where it does the most good. This fertilizer is a not intended to be a surface application."
2.0,Too restrictive of water pressure. I have an older one that works fine.
1.0,On off switch broke after third use - One year warranty. I am not sure who to contact . Disappointed last one lasted 10 or 15 years using it a few times a years . This one less than 6 months .
4.0,"Works well, but follow the advice other reviewers and purchase the Kink Free house adapter."
5.0,Works Great
5.0,"My third root feeder. I make a hole with rebar first. My bad the others died, will be easier on
this model."
5.0,"How do you describe a snath?  I broke the one I had, so I bought this one to replace it.  I took it out today and managed to destroy the old blade that I transferred to this snath.  (There is a theory among certain folks that you aren't really working hard until you start breaking tools.)  I guess that's probably not entirely relevant, except to say that this snath performed just fine and I have no complaints about it."
5.0,Was exactly what we wanted.
5.0,I've had vintage snaths over the years and this is the first new one I've bought. I am pleased to say this is just as good.
5.0,Harkening back to my agrarian roots.  Perfect tool for creekside trimming and mowing.  It will be used for many years.
3.0,Handles did not stay in place.  Had to use tape around Snath to help handles grip.
3.0,Angle is not correct for my height
5.0,"I paired this with a Austrian brush blade and it makes the best weed eater.  The snath is strong and very light.  Combined with the strait razor of a brush blade i installed on its adjustable head, it makes short work of sprouting bamboo thickets.
Thank You !"
3.0,"Handles slip no matter how much I tighten them.  Have cinched them down almost to the point of breaking the hardware and two or three swaths and the handles are loose again.  On the good side; blade attachment is easy and sturdy.  Overall, the quality is just not there despite ""Made in the USA"" stamped on the handle."
5.0,"Good length, nicely balanced.  Just a bit awkward to get it into & out of a car for transport, but well worth the minor inconvenience.  While it may be more logical to remove the blade for easier transport, there are some tools (this being one of them!) that I prefer to leave assembled.  While the aluminum snath may be lighter, I tend to have ""bad luck"" with aluminum tools.  I reckon that since my ancestors used wooden snaths, they're good enough for me.  Plus, there's times the extra weight of the wooden snath often gives much needed weight & momentum for easier use."
3.0,Wish it was not lacquered and just nude wood. The handles are stuck. Should have gotten a custom made one for the same price.
4.0,"Useful for watering parched trees, especially if the earth has hardened on the surface."
5.0,it worked great and having the built in shutoff valve is genius!  Makes it so easy.  I underestimated how many feed tablets I would need for the size of my trees and had to order more.
1.0,Garbage. Cheap plastic junk that barely works. Nothing like the all steel ones made when I was young.
4.0,works well . The ground in Nm is hard packed & sandy. Small amounts of clay in some areas. Hard to work feeder into the ground at times. Go slow & start shallow . The root feeder is well built however it is not indestructable.
2.0,tip broke twice on me
5.0,Works great. Good value for the money.
5.0,Best way to water newly planted trees.
4.0,"I used this root feeder about 3-4 times and it is working well so far.  I do wonder how long it will work.  Even though this is suppose to be ""heavy duty"", the build doesn't seem that way.  Much of it is heavy plastic.  Time will tell."
5.0,Used one time and saw a significant change in my lawn.
5.0,works great
5.0,good quality
5.0,"A ""taste"" of home.  I had no idea that these things are still produced, leave alone sold through Amazon.  And I could not be happier!!  I know, two exclamation marks is not professional, but I have no other way of expressing how pleased I am.  I live in a very remote place - no power - and a 1/2 acre yard that is entirely overgrown with something that is called ""Guinea Grass"" here locally - 8 ft tall stalks at 0.25 in diameter (rather similar to reed in appearance and density).  I almost gave in and paid for some professional mowing service that would have charged close to $800 to clear this, and then I remembered my grandfather and how he maintained a much larger area behind his house with a similar tool.  I thought if my grandfather can do it, why not I?  Provided I could find the equipment - a scythe is extremely old school - I could try the same.  And here is the fabulous news, not only did I find this tool here, I am almost done - one week of whacking away with the scythe (matching blade bought when I purchased the snath) - I can report that I am a more than proud older female (okay, I am older than 50 - but that is all I am going to admit) - I conquered the weeds with the help of this snath/scythe!  And I literally ""blew"" the minds of my neighbors who had never seen an awesome tool like this.  Not only beats this tool any electric or gas weed trimmer, it provides a nice upper body workout (at least when dealing with the weeds I had to conquer; I am sure for more normal vegetation it would be much easier) and saves the environment (no fuel needed).  I am so happy!  And did I already mention this?  It has the perfect shape for my body (I am 5' 8"") - very comfortable to use, sturdy, and aesthetically pleasing in its looks - of course not an important feature when talking about the functionality of a tool, but certainly important when you want to impress your neighbors.  I am a German transplant and being able to find this here made my ""year"" - I can keep my property cleaned up without having to pay someone.  Yeah!  Additionally, the snath arrived very quickly and without any issues. It does everything I could have hoped and wished for and much more!"
5.0,"It was extremely gratifying to see the ""made in USA"" label on this snath.  The construction is solid, from the manner that the handles are attached to the blade attachment. In the form of a suggestion, I would like more than one metal wedge provided to better facilitate the best angle of the blade to the user."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. It went together well and works just like new.
5.0,very happy with the product
4.0,Item arrived on time would recommend.
4.0,"Great quality, could use some assembly instructions."
5.0,I Love it. Perfect. And it fit my Vintage blade just fine.
5.0,"Great Snath.....The fit of all the steel to the wood was tight, the blade attachment was easy and well fitted. Had a problem with one of the handle adjustments (yes I was turning it properly but the hulk must have been responsible for the initial attachment). It is well balanced and worked very nicely clearing roadside weeds.  Highly recommend it when your old one wears out."
5.0,works great and it is just what I wanted
5.0,Works like it should and as expected.
5.0,"As others I found that the handles were loose and needed to be tightened.  I'm glad that I read other's reviews indicating that the handles have left hand threads.  I found that while the handles came loose, I could not tighten or loosen them by hand.  As another reviewer wrote, you need a pair of channel locks to adjust the tightness of the handles on the snath.

As others - I noticed that the handle bolts are ground flush with the nut.  I assumed that this meant that the snath was defective, I was wrong.  After loosening the handles, I threaded them on backwards to function as a ""die"" to remove the burrs from the bolts.  I then put the handles on correctly, adjusted them to the correct height and orientation on the snath and tightened them up with the channel locks.

It should be noted that the handles do need to be adjusted.  Needing the handles to be adjusted is not a ""fault"" with the product."
4.0,Great snath. Used it on the blackberries with a brush blade and now I need to get a grass blade.  Easy to use and very effective.
5.0,Very well constructed wood snath that is well balanced and comfortable to use.
5.0,Great tool. I lived abroad as a kid and saw this used. I know of nothing else that could do the job.
5.0,"Great Product, Fast Delivery"
5.0,perfect tool and of great quality. Have enjoyed using it since my antique one broke from my over use. OLD FASHION QUALITY.
5.0,"no problems.
works fine."
5.0,"Package received was damaged, as was the snath. No questions asked,...they sent another one which works great.
Ease of handling is phenomenal and blades are easily switched. Kudo's!"
5.0,Strong snath which was easy to mount the blade on.  The handles adjusted easily.
4.0,It is very hard to turn off and on. Plastic lever barely moves. It should not be this hard.  Also the amount of water coming out is very slow.  I do not think it is turning on completely.  I would not recommend.
5.0,"I ordered the ROSS heavy duty root and feeder through Amazon a couple of weeks ago and have used it once so far.  The reason for the purchase was to save a sugar maple in my back yard that may have been planted a couple of years ago. It was there when we bought our house last fall. This summer has had dry spells and the trees leaves have been getting burnt and yellow.  The yellowing of the leaves I suspected to be an iron deficiency. My soil is a heavy black clay and the back yard has a good slope for drainage. Do to the slope some rain or my irrigating goes down the drain instead of soaking into the ground getting to the tree roots. The Ross Root feeder was the solution to this. I did read reviews both good and bad about the product. And to be honest when you put heavy duty on a the label you don't expect a plastic handle, but after using it the plastic does seem sturdy enough to last a few years.  I'll update this and take  away stars if anything changes.  Water from my garden hose comes out at 55 psi which seemed more than adequate for the tool. Water shoots out 4 directions and I had it running going into the ground and out.  Some reviewers complained of the nozzle plugging up, I had no issues and my soil is a sticky gumbo when wet. The the hand grip and hose connection is made of a heavy plastic and didn't give or feel weak while pushing the root feeder into the ground and out again. There are two very tiny indents on the metal rod that goes into the ground at 6 and 12 inches. You go 12"" deep for trees and 6"" deep for shrubs. Because these would be impossible to see, I used some electrical tape to mark the spots and that worked great. Connection to the garden hose was a snap and had no leaks at any point. Same with the cup where the fertilizer goes.  The shut-off valve on the root feeder worked perfectly so far too. I watered two young trees and several bushes around the house much faster than with a soaker hose(which I was thinking of buying before settling on the ROSS root feeder). As for the tree I am trying to keep alive, it's only been a couple days so I will wait and see and update this accordingly."
5.0,What can I say other than this works perfectly for the intended purpose of root watering & fertilizing.
5.0,Very good tool for deep root feeding.
5.0,works well
1.0,Lousy design.  95% of the water sprays to the sides (above the surface) while virtually no water feeds the roots.  Poor design especially with the need to rotate the feeder around the hose to couple.  What a ripoff!  Do not buy.
5.0,"I think this is great. I mainly use it for watering trees, like dogwoods, during summer droughts here in Virginia. It puts the water in the tree root zone rather than trying to get the water to soak in from the surface with a hose. I set the water flow to just a trickle because I'm on a low-flow well. I wore my old one out from years of being pushed down into rocky soil, so this purchase is a replacement."
5.0,works well and saw results when used on bushes and trees
5.0,Awesome tool for trees and shrubs.
5.0,Good quality tool!
5.0,What a fine stick for attaching a ghastly blade this is! You'll love it to pieces.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!

It broke after 10 minutes of use. The bolt that holds the blade in place stripped out. Also, the handles that you hold on to wiggle and shift while you are trying to cut."
5.0,My husband was thrilled to get this and start using it in the field.
2.0,"If the handles were actually adjustable, I would be using it as a primary snath. Loosening the handles took so much pressure from the vise grips that the handles both have ugly dents and scrapes on them. Yes, I used padding to try and protect the wood from the tools. I adjusted the handles and tightened them, and the lower handle was set to go. But the upper handle just won't stay tight enough to stay put. I have the heavy brush blade on it now, and only use it for short periods - using the lower handle and an improvised grip of the upper snatch shaft. The upper handle just flops around out of the way."
4.0,"There are times when old technology wins out over new.  This Snath is good solid wood, with steel bands for the hand grips. They are not so tight they can't be moved, but because of the shape of the snath arm, they can only be adjusted so far.  So that might be limiting for some people.  there are also three different holes for mounting the end of the scythe blade but not a clue as to what each one is for and what is best.  While there are lots of videos out there about using a scythe, only found one about mounting the blade itself.  Still not sure I've got it right.  Do not have acres of  grasses to cut, but do have some tough weeds that defeat all the different electric and gas weed wackers I've tried - hence the scythe.  and while I may not have it right, it does the job nicely"
3.0,THE RIGHT HANDLE IS PRONE TO ROTATING DOWNWARD.  THE HANDLE RINGS NEED TEETH.  SOME BLADE MOUNTING INSTRUCTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL.
5.0,"Item is exactly as described. Arrived a little late due to an incomplete mailing address,  but still within the shipping window. Heavy duty wood construction with steel parts, has held up well to the average use and abuse I have given it with the bush whacker blade (purchased separately. ) While I was slightly disappointed at the rough hewn ""finished end"" where it appears no one took the time to de-burr the wood splintering from where the attachment was hammered on, it was otherwise in excellent condition. The counter-rotational threading of the handles took some getting used to but turns out to be an excellent design; I was able to quickly and easily adjust the handles positions in such a way as to make it a perfect fit (by rotating the handle closest to the blade clockwise 90 degrees) the handles were otherwise spaced perfectly for my 6' frame and arm length. Snath flexibility is just enough to absorb shock from accidental ground strikes or tough stalks such as 1/2"" mesquite or cat's claw acacia. After the first few minutes the head bolts that go through the snath head required tightening but this was to be expected,  and the hardware has held up flawlessly under duress. No further tightening was required after the first adjustment, and I cleared a half acre with it. The three positioning holes in the tip (for the scythe tang) are most excellent for determining the best blade angle for whichever scythe you choose. Finally, as wood is nonconductive, I have no fear of this tool accidentally getting me electrocuted if I were to run across a stray power line or buried cable exposed to the surface under the brush. My ribs are killing me but the workout was totally worth it; you haven't lived until you have cleared land by hand with this fine tool, and the cool factor for a ""Grim Reaper"" look is undeniable. Made in America, works exactly as advertised,  and a genuine investment.  A+."
3.0,"I mow about an acre of alfalfa 3x per season for hay with one of these (and a grass blade).  Had it for 3 or 4 years now.

Easy to adjust once you figure out that the handles have left hand threads...

After the first season of use, though, the end that holds the blade and the handle attachments wear away the wood shaft, and you can't tighten the blade or handles enough.  The blade and the handles wobble on the wood shaft.

I've resorted to rebuilding the wood where things attach with (in no particular order): JB Weld, leather, sheet metal strips, etc.  I'm still looking for the best material and method.

That said, it's a heck of a lot of fun and the world's best exercise to cut your own hay."
5.0,"My husband loves it. It is exactly like the original snath he needed to replace. It did have a small flaw, but we decided to keep it anyway."
4.0,Works well
5.0,Works very well
5.0,"just add pellets, hook water hose, stick in the ground and pull the trigger...wala, your trees get instant nutrition!"
3.0,"I bought this in hopes of saving a sick apple tree. An arborist suggested drilling holes around the dripline and filling with triple16 fertilizer but I saw this and decided to give this a whirl as I also have some evergreens and a mess of other trees that could use some tlc.
At this point I cannot say whether or not it works, this review is based only on the feeder itself.
First the positive. It seems like a great idea. I paid someone to do what this does last year so if it works for someone who's going to dip into my pockets, why not for me!
I read a lot of negative reviews about the durability, I disagree with them. While it's not built for hammering nails or prying panels off a wall, it is made of plastic and aluminum after all, it was in one piece and held together when I connected it.
The rest pretty much worked as described. Turn water on, stab into ground.
Now the negative. The completely worthless instructions. Maybe for others they made perfect sense but for someone trying this for the first time I'd hope for a little more clarity. Having used the spikes before, I understand some basics of what I'm trying to do but...Per the instructions I need 2 ""refills"" per inch diameter of the tree. Tree is 18"", so 36 ""refills"", so far pretty easy. But that's all it says. 36 refills around the drip line..how many per application? all in one spot? one per 36 spots?  No clue. So treated them like spikes in the past as far as spacing goes. game out to about 3 refills per spot.
Next, now long should this take?  This may seem like a silly question but an estimated application time would really be helpful. Per the instructions I put my little refill sticks into the cup, closed, turned on low and inserted the spike to the required depth and slowly turned it onto full, again per the instructions. Seemed like it was going well, water was swishing around the cup and the sticks, nothing was flooding out of the hole so I walked away to do other things. about 5 minutes later I came to check on and it appeared the sticks hadn't ""melted"" at all, they were the same size as when I started. I turn it off, open the cup and moosh them up a bit with my finger, put the lid back on and turn it on again, that worked. But is that what I'm supposed to do? No clue because the directions stop at '2 per inch'. This is what I ended up doing around my tree, it seems to put out a decent amount of water on high so I would start it low until the sticks softened, moosh them up, shoot them down and then put it on high for a mysterious amount of time. I either fed my tree or have 12 pockets of super nutritious dirt."
5.0,"This has been a valuable tool for drought conditions like we have in California.  It gets water (and fertilizer) down to the root level very efficiently.  Even as our drought eases, I will continue to use it.  The plants are very happy.

Note: we have hard clay soil and after many uses the tip bent.  I called the company and received a replacement very promptly.  The customer service agent was helpful and gracious."
5.0,Great tree and shrub feeder.  Takes a while to break down the fertilizer tablet but definitely delivers a ton of water and nutrients to the trees and shrubs.  So far I have done one treatment this year will do a second treatment in the fall
5.0,This was ok. I wish they made them a bit more heavy duty.
1.0,"This was the root feeder I bought first and it broke after one season, plastic is not durable and it cracked. Much better brands are available that are all metal construction, my second one is now in its 3rd season of use. Avoid garden tools made with plastic parts!"
1.0,Light weight junk.. Maybe this was designed for kids?  It broke after one box of refils.
5.0,Root feeder works great to water the roots. Problem comes in with the fertilizer spikes which dissolve in seconds. Placed four spikes with each feed and they last less than 30-60 seconds so it is hard to tell how much you are feeding each plant or tree.
5.0,works great
4.0,Performs as expected.  Recommend the heavy duty model if your soil is rocky as is mine.
5.0,A very useful tool for deep watering.
5.0,This will allow you to get water and nutrients right to the roots.  This thing is great.
5.0,"In Texas, you have to get to the roots due to the hot summers.  This feeder will do the job. Deep in the Heart of Texas!"
5.0,works well with ferterlizer.
3.0,good product
5.0,"I bought the Ross Root Feeder for the backyard oak tree, but it has worked out so well that I plan to expand its use next year."
5.0,"You gotta have one of these!  My neighbor let me use his, and after using it, I went on-line and bought one!  These root feeder ae really great, especially in this long drought in California!"
4.0,"With our drought in California in the Bay Area, my Cypress trees were suffering.  I cut back on the length of my showers so that I could water the trees down closer to the roots."
5.0,very good
5.0,Easy to use
5.0,"This thing looks well made. I connected it to the hose and used the switch valve to control pressure. So I inserted it with some water coming out so it didn't clog with dirt and little by little the needle went farther down. After a couple of days of having irrigated the tree, the tree still looks the same but i am expecting it may start getting better after some time or after some more watering sessions. I will add more info later."
3.0,Works as intended.
4.0,"First of all, I am definitely not a good gardener and tend to have a hard time keeping plants healthy.  That and I live in California, where we have to really conserve water.  Sprinklers are out just because it wastes so much water.  This tool really made a difference.  My plants are a lot healthier, even when I only water every 2 weeks or so.  It's also quite sturdy.  I don't have the strength to push it in, especially since my soil is full of pebbles, so I turn on the water as I'm pushing it in and step on the top to drive it all the way down to the soil.  So far, none of the plastic parts have broken.  The only annoying thing is that the plastic connector leaks, even when it was brand new."
5.0,Works great. Saves water.
5.0,good!
4.0,"Works good in regular soil, not as good in rocky soil."
5.0,Good product
2.0,Only used this product about four times before it began leaking badly from the plastic head and the connection between the head and the metal stem.  A well-built all metal product would probably be great but this product is cheaply manufactured and won't last.
5.0,This product has helped me to water my tomatoes and trees in my yard. I use it with nutrients to give to plants and trees.  The water is getting to the root of the plants where it is needed. You save water by using this tool instead of watering the plant until the ground is soaked. This does very little to get to the roots of the plant.
5.0,"So far, no problems with this.  Went easily into our pretty hard soil since the tip is nice and sharp.  Easy to hook up to the hose.  I've only tried it for watering, not for fertilizing, so I have no input on that feature."
5.0,Excellent
5.0,Great for watering plant roots in arid climates.
5.0,"These feeders are hard to find in states or in certain area of states with plenty of rain....but to fertilize or just deep feed, their super.  Well worth the investment."
5.0,Outstanding price and great transaction.
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"Hope it saves some water. So far, so good."
4.0,"The applicator went into the ground fairly well, though it was often hard to get it to go as deep as necessary. But our yard is rocky.  Still it didn't break!"
5.0,Had the old one for close to twenty years hope this one last that long
4.0,"Based on the 1 and 2 star reviews, I bought a Melnor Kink-free Hose Saver for $5 at Home Depot (you can get it on Amazon too). I put teflon tape on the male end and tightened it into the green female plastic connector on the Ross Root Feeder. Then I wrapped duct tape 4 or 5 times around the green plastic connector. So far so good. I am using this strictly for watering so far (trees are looking ""stressed"" due to our drought; this should be more water-efficient than surface watering, albeit more work). My hands are smaller than the average man's, but they still extend beyond the yellow part of the handle. I suspect this is one cause of breakage of the green connector - be careful not to put force on the hose connector when you are pushing on the handles to drive the root feeder into the soil. I'm going with 4 stars on the assumption that these precautions are necessary to avoid breakage - with better design/quality they wouldn't be."
5.0,"I thought I was buying the yellow (plastic model) shown in the pic at the lowest possible price.  I also thought that the over-used descriptor ""Heavy Duty"" in the tittle referred to this model.  I was so pleased to promptly receive a truly industrial, metal version I didn't know existed.  BRAVO!"
5.0,does a great job
5.0,"California's drought has taken its toll on my young Red Maple shade trees. My local water district has restricted Sun.& Wed. Outdoor watering cycles, while raising 2015 water cost 12%, with projected 27% overall price hikes in next 4 years.

This ""stinger"" saved my trees, reduced my consumption and gets water where it is needed (the roots).

No more runoff.  A little pricey but ROI in 2 months."
5.0,"I was skeptical when I first bought this feeder. I have hundreds of fruit trees and know that the fertilizer stakes can burn roots so I needed get more up-to-date on the feeding method. I searched for an industrial line and to my surprise they aren't much different except a much higher price. Having heavy clay I was worried I would break the plastic handle while pushing it into the ground. There are four water/Feed outlets at the tip and if you start the water first it 'Water drills' down to the roots with so much ease that if you run into a root you can easily move it. I have had great success with this tool and the food that goes with it. If you are need of root feeding, You will love this tool."
5.0,Good as expected.
5.0,"Great, as expected"
5.0,Does a great job.
1.0,"received it yesterday, used it for a few hours today and it is already broken - water leaking from the handles - no water flowing down the irrigation tubing, the holes are clear at the bottom. VERY annoyed....."
5.0,Great buy!  Saves a lot of water.
2.0,"overall good idea, but not sufficient for treating large trees or a significant number of trees"
5.0,Works great much tougher than feeders in big box store. Saved new planting in unexpected PNW drought
3.0,"Ordered as a Replacement for an older Ross feeder.  The newer feeder is mostly plastic as opposed to the older unit (that lasted for years) which was metal.  Surprised when received as it is listed as the ""Heavy Duty Model"".  We'll see how it holds up."
5.0,"So far so good, working well after one week of feeding trees"
4.0,It arrived. It works well.
4.0,For my husband.  Useful since we are in a severe drought so he deep waters the trees so as not to waste water.
5.0,"works great how ever you have to push it in a little at a time. Push it in pull it out, make sure the flow is going, push it back in a little farther and repeat"
5.0,This worked really well to get some much-needed moisture to my roots.
5.0,Good sturdy device. Had one years ago and this has many improvements!
3.0,"OK product good price, sent quickly"
5.0,Easy to use
5.0,"We were totally skeptical about this.  I bought it for my husband to use on our new trees that we just planted.  The trees were having a hard time with the transplant to our house, and not looking so happy.  My husband used this root feeder on each of our new trees and I couldn't believe how much better they look.  I think this may really work!"
5.0,"In SF Bay Area here, so experiencing pretty severe drought.  I'm letting the rest of my lawn and landscaping take the brunt of the drought.  Not that we're holier than thou, just that there isn't much we're really wedded to keeping prior to a total re-do.  However, we do have a few mature Magnolia trees, and even they are starting to show signs of too little to drink.  And, as precious as water is, it does after all rank slightly after oxygen.  So I tried surface watering by hand.  With everything being so dry, it soaked in very poorly, and ran off into the street.  So, I look like the neighborhood eco-terrorist du jour.  Neither I, nor my neighbors, nor my tree were happy.  So I picked up something like this at a local medium-box store, but it had the water coming out the very tip, the same tip that has to push down into the ground.  Maybe ok for soft flowerbed material, but not for the hard-pack around my thirsty trees.  So the very helpful people at the store recommended this product specifically.  Amazon had it for a good price, and let's face it, they'll have it to my house before I can get my act together to go looking for one locally.  Just got done trying it tonight, and this thing is what's going to get me and my trees through this drought!  It worked absolutely as intended.  I watered around one tree for almost an hour.  Even at pretty high pressure, the runoff into the street was limited to a little swatch about 4"" x 10', and even that was just new operator error.  My neighbors spray system ran for 10 minutes while I was out there and flowed down the street about 4 houses' length.  So this is simple math, folks.  My tree got an hour of good soaking right to the roots with no (above ground, at least) runoff.  My neighbor's got 10 minutes of surface watering that, after runoff, evaporation, and thirsty grass, probably didn't amount to much.  That this thing can deliver a shot of fertilizer to the roots come Fall is just gravy.

Here are a couple of things:  Definitely get this ""heavy duty"" one, because it doesn't appear to be any too ""heavy.""  If you got your pressure off center as you were inserting it, it doesn't feel like it'll take much to bend it.  This one sprays multiple streams sideways once it's in. That has to be much better for dispersion than one that just sprays straight down.  Also, you don't need any kind of auger or anything, or at least I didn't.  I just poked around until I could get it a good 6"" or so in, and then ran it slowly for a few seconds, after which it would slide right in.  Also, this one has a knob right on it.  I didn't realize how important this was, until I was out there moving it around every few minutes or so.  Making trips back and forth to the faucet twice per move or spraying myself (it shoots 6' or so when above ground in each direction) as I moved it would have been no bueno.  Protip: I also replaced the washers all along my hose system and went from spraying everywhere to almost no leaks.  I was struck by how cheap the standard washers in my hoses were (although this product has a good supple washer).  Protip2: check your type of tree and typical root system.  For example, my magnolia trees rarely root deeper than 2 feet, but can spread to 4x the branch width.  So I need to water less per site but across a much wider area than, say, a maple."
5.0,This is a very good way to feed roses and flowering shrubs and you don't have to disturb mulch beds.
5.0,GREAT price here on Amazon compared to the local nursery. Works just as described. Easy to use.
5.0,"Love this for deep watering and fertilizing the shrubs in my yard.  Water and fertilizer gets to the roots instead of running off the top of dense, hard packed soil."
4.0,Great Product Thank you!
5.0,"It's important to have the holes on the side.  That way, it never plugs.  Now because of the draught in CA, I'm deep watering the plants instead of over head.  We'll see how it goes."
1.0,very poor quality
5.0,"product works great, it is very nice and durable"
5.0,"Great item, easy to use."
5.0,Because of our drought are trees were going into distress.  Tried these and they have really brought our trees back to life.
5.0,it works perfect
2.0,"I bought this after I had borrowed my friend's.  My friend has one that is several years old.  His works great.  Mine looks like his and does not seem different as far as the quality goes, but the water just trickles out of mine.  The water comes out of his  at a nice flow.  I bought this for deep watering of two of my trees. Don't think it is going to do the job.  Very disappointed."
4.0,"Works well, I've gone through about 80 pellets so far.  I would have given it 5 stars except while it very clearly states it is made in USA, the package clearly states it is made in China.  Also Amazon just threw it in the box with two bricks of pellets, the bricks are basically, well . . . bricks, they bounced around, knocked out the end handle plug and broke off the tab.  Since this doesn't effect the function at all it was just an annoyance.  The last time I had something from amazon mis-labeled I spent a considerable amount of time on the phone with a gentleman from India that  gave me two stellar choices of A. return it, B. get ten percent back.  I explained that both of these were very inconvenient and I really just wanted what I ordered, I eventually got a better deal from his supervisor.  I decide it wasn't worth the effort this time, maybe next time if I have any doubt I'll just go to the store.  Amazon, pay attention to your write-ups people read them, things like this lose you customers!"
5.0,Still working well for me.
5.0,"great product, works well, good value"
5.0,Works great!
4.0,Appears to work pretty good.  Our soil in Oklahoma has a lot of clay and the holes in the tip were easily clogged by the clay.  Also the clear cup should be larger and more heavy duty.
5.0,"I was very pleased with the Ross Root Feeder, easy to use, looking forward to very healthy trees!"
5.0,Worked very well. Attached Miracal Grow Feeder with a short hose at hose bib. Fertilized the plants. They are really popping!
5.0,"I want green happy plants, but we have a serious drought in CA. This is a great solution to making every drop of water count. Not only will this feeder efficiently water each plant, it's great for opening up roots if you don't own an aerator! The on and off valve also helps you makes sure that no water is wasted when moving it from plant to plant! Great product even if you're not in a drought!"
4.0,Works well but some may find insertion of the rod in very hard soil to be difficult.
4.0,Saves us hundreds of dollars doing it ourselves!
5.0,Good product
4.0,"Root Feeders are and excellent way to provide deep watering for your trees. This Ross Root feeder work and allows me to deep water and fertilize my trees however for a few extra bucks I prefer the Heavy Duty Ross Root Feeder and would recommend that model over this one if your budget allows. Both models have cut off values, water adjustment and fertilizer reservoirs but the Heavy Duty model just feels better and will probably last longer.

Overall this Ross mode 10233 102 root feed is good and the heavy duty model is just a little better. Take a look at both and buy either this one or the Heavy Duty model .... your Trees will Thank You!."
5.0,My husband uses these all the time.  We have purchased others for our neighbors and family members.  They also love them.  Gets down to the roots and helps our trees and lawn grow healthy and stay green.
5.0,I used it to drill several two foot holes around a tree and insert deep water tubes tied into my sprinkler system.  We have very hard rocky clay soil and it made the holes with ease.
2.0,"Bought this and the evergreen fertilizer.....the fertilizer cloggged it and is a pain to clean out. For the expensive price, you think it would be free from these kinds of design errors"
5.0,Great for Deep Watering
5.0,Great price -- Great Service !!!
5.0,"gets to the root of things....ha ha.....""only way to get down""."
5.0,works well
3.0,Nothing more to tell.
4.0,Leaks a bit if not closed just right. But great way to water on a hot day.
5.0,Great Buy & Fast Shipping
5.0,Thank You!!!  Everything was great....exactly what I ordered.
5.0,Excellent. H.Sh.
4.0,Just what I needed for the drought here in California. Works well.
5.0,"Really helped my newly planted trees get a good start, as we have not had enough rain for them to make it on their own."
5.0,"Well made.  I had no trouble inserting the feeder into the ground with a small flow of water running, as the instructions recommend.  By the way, I measured the water flow of the feeder, with hose spigot and feeder valve fully open, to be 1.2 gallon/minute."
5.0,"I received very good product and and customer service

Thank you"
5.0,"Just buy it, and get ready to see a HUGE difference in your plants.  California has been in a drought for 3 years, but my yard is green, while using 70% less water.  Instead of watering the surface of the ground, and hoping the plant will eventually get the water...the Ross Root Feeder sends the water directly down into the roots, and the plants love it !"
2.0,"The water slowly trickles out of this waterer, not like the water pressure of the older one I had."
5.0,Works as advertised!
5.0,I now have two of these feeders and they are wonderful.
5.0,I love this Ross Root Feeder it is truly heavy duty and gets the job done when you add water it feeds the trees roots at a deep level and it has greatly improved my Buford Pear ornamental trees!!
5.0,Everything Ross makes is good.  My first one lasted over 25 years.  Helps take care of older trees and uses much less  water.
5.0,The root feeder is good for deep watering or fertilizing but the only problem is if the soil is dense you need to saw a larger hole so the solution goes into the soil instead of flowing out the top of the feeder.  My soil is clay on top of hard pan so it takes awhile to find a spot I can push it into.  I saved a sick live oak tree with this feeder as I could deep water it and feed it by the roots.
3.0,"It works as expected...i agree with the others that the hose connection should be made of metal. It will hold up, but you have to be careful."
3.0,"Cheap Plastic Construction, Made in China...Not the original, metal Ross Root Feeder of old.  Will be lucky if lasts 2 seasons, judging by the feedback from other reviewers.  Feeding barrell appears to be metal-coated--not fully metal.  That being said, I do like the fact that the water in the barrel sprays N-S-E-W...not just straight down into the ground.  Root-feeding delivers moisture and nutrients to plant roots directly with minimal water waste--the only way to go.  Just wish the quality of the feeder was more robust."
5.0,A must have for proper watering of trees and bushes.
5.0,Great item for using to water an individual plant.  I use it with some dry miracle grow on new bushes.  little fragile but just be careful and don't drop it.
1.0,"The handles are bent up, they should be bent down, there is a lot of tension at the connect. Plastic threads and metal threads from the hose do not work together, yes I added a thin washer because it leaked in time. The on/off switch was hard to turn. The handles are too small for big hands they need to be longer and reinforced under the handles because folks will be push down. Need more holes at the bottom for water to come out faster. Two at the very bottom another two about 3/4"" higher of the other two but on the opposite sides and so on the total eight holes. I need to be a designer I think. Who tests these? I bought all metal irriatator attach my lawn sprayer to it then I bought an all brass on/off switch and drill four small holes at the bottom. IT WORKS AWESOME!! I can just deep root water and or feed my trees, bushes and firs. Irriatator $26.99 on/off switch $2.89 had the sprayer already."
4.0,"This is an excellent tool for the homeowner/hobbyist gardener. The materials are not really commercial grade ""heavy duty"". I use these in my tree service business, and have to purchase a new one every 6 months or so. Non-commercial users should easily get a few years of service from the tool if properly handled and cared for.

The results are quickly noticeable. The fertilizer formulations work well. Too bad they don't make a pesticide.

TIP: A couple of times a year is sufficient for most applications."
5.0,Feels light weight but is actually very strong. Just be sure the ground isn't too dry and hard and push down slowly in case you hit a rock.
5.0,"I don't know why some people complain about the quality unless they're using a sledge hammer to put it in the ground.

Works perfectly and I could actually see a difference in the heath of a 500 year old Oak tree I used it on.  The drought was causing the leaves to be very small and silver in appearance.  I purchased the high nitrogen feeder refills and ran the whole package through the feeder.  Within one week the tree started putting out bright green a very large leaves.

This thing may have saved the tree."
5.0,Great tool!
2.0,"Difficult to get the food through the holes in the bottom of the feeder.  Plastic hose and handle cracked inside, cant fix.  We were very disappointed.  Trying to find a better way to feed our fruit trees."
4.0,"The feeder worked great for me. I had no issues with it other than the on-off lever being nearly impossible to move--it was easier for me to turn the water on and off at the faucet. Also, the lever is on the underside of the device, making things awkward and a challenge to figure out which way to toggle it (if it moved easily this would not be a problem). The device, including the plastic cup, seems sturdy enough. Mine does not leak. It's very easy to use."
3.0,It works pretty much as intended. But the shut-off valve no longer shuts off the water completely after just a few minutes of use. We do have high water pressure so that might have caused the problem. It is still usable. It is relatively easy to insert into hard soil when the water is on.
1.0,It did not function at all.
5.0,"I love this product!  I have two now and it works GREAT.  You can push the rod into the ground for the amount of water you need in the layer of dirt/grass you have.  It feeds the trees/or the lawn.  It's PERFECT.  Here in Mesquite TX we have hard CLAY, this feeder puts water into the root system without ground lever evaporation."
5.0,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. The only thing that I was surprised with was how slow the water will come out of the bottom. It literally drips down into the bottom to feed the tree very slowly. I guess that is what it was supposed to do.
5.0,Works great
5.0,These dopes think I'm going to write something here. Nuts to them.
5.0,This is the second root feeder we have owned. The last one lasted almost 15 years. It is the best way to water and feed during the drought we are having in California. We have been able to keep our plants healthy without wasting water by over spraying. I would give it 5 stars.
5.0,"Having purchased four of these and used them on 50 trees and bushes several times, I found that they do an outstanding job of fertilizing and also for watering.  While the construction appeared weak at first, I found it to be extremely strong when pushing them into extremely hard soil."
3.0,"I guess it works, haven't used it yet."
5.0,Works great
4.0,Works as expected but do not attempt to put any other type of fertilizer in the pod.
5.0,Great to water trees without wasting water. You can also use the root feeder refills.
5.0,"We're in deep drought in southern california - and trees, more vulnerable than usual because of the drought,  are being attacked and killed by pests.  This is not my first effort at deep watering trees - saves water and gets to the roots as well, but this year is my first trial with Ross Heavy Duty -
These are numbers 6-7 of this tool - kept buying more as i became more convinced they were doing the job.  and SO easily.  put it in the ground, screw the hose on, turn on the water - you can SEE the water bubbling as it enters the tool.  take the feeder out and you'll see 4 strong sprays.  easy to stick in, easy to pull out and move.
Today, as i was placing the Ross root feeder /waterer at  one side of what had been a near-death avocado tree two months ago, i saw a ton of new leaves.  a TON.  i knew the Ross system was getting deep (you can tell) and all i could do was try.  today - the results.
this tool saves trees.  get it before you can't save yours."
5.0,"Since most of the Southwest is in a drought, we really needed something that would help some of our distressed trees without wasting water.  The Ross root feeder goes at least a 12-18 inches into the ground and waters the trees without wasting water.  The shaft appears to be quite sturdy and the pointed tip helps drill into stubborn dirt.  We bought the combo pack of two feeders and are able to water both sides of our property at the same time."
4.0,have had no problems with it and thankfully it's saving my oak tree
5.0,Works great...  Buy the 54 pack refills as you will use more than you expect..  The fertilizer sticks do not dissolve evenly over time so I learned not to put in more than 2 at a time and then add 2 more as the previous 2 were almost gone..
3.0,works as expected.  I wish that the hose connection was a little more substantial(all plastic throughout the product) as I have reservations about how rugged the unit is and how long it will last.
5.0,I bought my second  Ross root feeder because I have enough trees to water that it cuts my time in half . I have had thenprevious one for two years and it has worked well and without issue . Very good product !
5.0,"We bought 2 of these years ago. They work wonderful getting roots of trees, roses and flowers down instead to the top of the ground where in the hot Oklahoma Summers they will bake. These are not as heavy made as the previous ones so I hope they will last. These have a lot of plastic the others were metal."
5.0,Awesome product!! I honestly wish I'd bought it years ago!  Best deep root tree waterer I've ever seen! And the ability to add fertilizer or iron supplements is worth the price alone. Those tree stake fertilizers that you pound into the ground leave dead spots in my lawn. This product solves that problem and more!
5.0,Have used one for years. It does a great job for building up roots and watering at the same time.
1.0,I found out the hard way that Ross UPC of 12044 is for both the 1200C and the 1200D. The 1200D is worthless if used to just water trees as the water flow is very restricted.
1.0,"This is not like the Ross products of the past that were made with strong quality materials.  This thing fell apart during its first use.  Cheap plastic, thin metal, just horrible!!  I had one for many many years but unfortunately it got lost when I moved so I wanted one just like it.  The product quality was not there, it got lost as well!"
4.0,"I ordered this because of watering restrictions in my area because of the persistent drought.  In an attempt to reduce surface evaporation, I ordered this for my yard and garden.

This gadget does a great job at getting the water to the roots where the plants can best utilize it.  I also discovered that it makes a great ""aerator"" since the water loosens the soil as you press it in (whether this is truly effective, I cannot ascertain - for all I know, the water makes the feeder go in easier, but when withdrawn the soil could just fill back in; however, I do notice my plants thriving)

Two quirks about the device, that make me question the durability:
1. The hose connection and the valve switch.  It does not seem reinforced enough. As such I leave this device connected to my hose reel.  The valve switch seems a bit flimsy which leads me to suspect that this may not hold its position over time.
2. The fertilizer compartment seal.  When I first got this and tried using it, water squirted out of the fertilizer cap.  I had to reseat the seal and tighten the top twice - the seal doesn't like to stay in place.  Given this fact, I don't think I would fertilize via this route - I would probably use plant spikes and this device to help dig into the soil to place the spikes.

Apart from the two quirks I find this device quite useful for the garden and much more effective at delivering water deeply without wasting water (versus watering the surface and having the water diffuse down).  Had it not been for my area's watering restrictions, I probably would not have sought out this product.  Having used it - I am pleased, and I do feel like I waste less water by not spraying the surface of beds and having it just evaporate.  Definitely room for improvement, but otherwise a decent product."
5.0,"Get it, try it and watch your items grow beyond your expectations. I could not believe hot this and the Yard Butler saved my plants! Jamie"
5.0,We have been feeding our almost dead ash tree with the Ross Root Feeder and the tree is beginning to produce leaves on most of the branches where it looked dead before.
5.0,"Have been using this product since I was a little girl, helping my mom in the yard :) I searched the nurseries in Utah and could not find one, so I turned to amazon. I specifically bought this because I got a new Japanese Lilac tree.  Our soil is so tough that the water just runs off and never soaks into the roots.  From day one, the leaves on my tree have perked up.  I can add root simulator and other fertilizers to the water too.  I have also started using the root feeder on most of my other large shrubs and and trees just for deep watering."
1.0,"Did not work out of box.  Called company, said many have defective valves.  Having another one shipped to me.  We shall see if they are all paperweights."
4.0,Easy to use.  I've seen good results within three  weeks of applying Ross products with this Feeder.  I recommend it highly.
5.0,"My old one died and I needed a replacement. I found it at a local garden shop and bought it. When I found out it was $11 less on Amazon I returned the local one.  I try to support local businesses as much as possible but 25% more??!!  I don't think so.  It's a great way to keep trees healthy here in dry, hot-summer Colorado. What's weird is the feeder cartridges are cheaper locally."
4.0,"I bought my first Ross Root Feeder about 3 years ago. I had to replace it a few days ago due to the plastic water coupler parts cracking and leaking. There is NO way to repair the item. The amount of force needed to penetrate dry or rocky soils evidently makes the plastic handle flex to the point where pressure is applied to the coupler joint.

It would be nice if the critical parts that are subjected to pressure were made of metal.

I bought a second type of root feeder, on Amazon that is ENTIRELY metal, has a lifetime warranty and can easily adapt a fertilizer container such as the Miracle Grow Feeder.

I had to buy a 2nd Ross model since I had several packages of their proprietary fertilizer. Once that is gone, I will be using Miracle grow entirely.

Here in Texas root feeding is a no brainer because of the frequent drought conditions. A special feeder can also be used for feeding the root structure of grass/sod. I heartily recommend both for saving money on the water bill."
5.0,This is my second root feed and I love them to keep my trees and shrubs green without a lot of water. The fertilizer and its application is also very good. The only down side is that the water pressure coming out of the nozzle is not a high a pressure as my previous root feeder that I dah for 10 years. I recommend the root feeder for every gardener. I attached a quick disconnect on the water input side so I can change out with other hose attachments quickly.
3.0,"The feeder is good but not great.  While it would likely cost more, replacing the plastic with metal, would give me a great deal more confidence in the root feeder. in very soft soil, it performed O.K. On harder to penetrate sandy soil, I had to use a yard butler root irrigator I already owned to ""pre-drill"" the hole and then insert the Ross Root feeder into the same hole, and feed the plants that way.

I would recommend this product for areas that are easier to water, but if it takes any force to push the feeder more than 3 or 4 inches into the ground, I would have concerns that the handle could break."
5.0,"I highly reccomment this not only for feeding the large plants and trees, but living in very dry Texas, it is an efficient way to deep water."
5.0,This delivers fertilizer down to where the trees need it--at the roots.  It works great and no water was wasted.
3.0,"Rod not strong enough for our Arizona soil.  Mixture would come back up to the surface around the rod.
The fertilizer would sometimes get clogged in the glass holder.
Dirt clogged the holes in the rod and had to be opened with a paper clip."
5.0,Works as advertise. The handle system is all plastic so it does not feel as durable as older models made totally out of metal but this system does work.
5.0,"Sturdy and easy to use. The advantage of this is that you can feed all your bushes and trees as often as you need without hiring an expensive arborist. Yes, the water preassure from the arborist truck might be greater so they open more airating tunnels, but with this tool if you do it more often you get the same effect at a fraction of the cost."
4.0,It seems to work well but there is leakage around the base around the tip which i am not thrilled about.  I have endeavored to keep the tip clear of clogs.  It still seems to work and I don't know if leakage in this area is normal.  i will continue to use it.
5.0,I have used one of these for years in MN.  Here in Arizona it needs a drill attached to penetrate the hard soil.  I will keep trying.
2.0,"I had the old style feeder for years it was made of metal it worked great. It finally broke so I purchased the new Heavy Duty model, it lasted two seasons the quality of the material is poor.
The first thing that failed was the tip was not as strong as the old model.
Second the hose connector leaked no matter what type of washer I used.
And finally the hose connector cracked and rendered it useless.
It is sad because I have boxes of the fertilizer with no feeder, and it was not cheap."
3.0,Durability remains in question because of the dominance of plastic in critical areas.  Ross would do better to produce one in a metal version if they are going to call it heavy-duty.
5.0,"I paid several hundred dollars to get trees fertilized last summer.  Guess what the tree guy used?  You guessed it.  I was concerned after reading the reviews but after seeing the great results I gave it a try.  I never had any issues at all.  I just follow the instructions and never had any problem with clogging or penetration.  Just ease it in and let the spray tip soften the ground as you go.  Gentle pressure worked for me.  I realize it isn't sturdy enough to pound into the ground.  I just treated it as the delicate instrument it is and never had any issues.  I was surprised at how fast the fertilizer pellets dissolve and inject once the depth is reached.

I am VERY happy."
4.0,"Anything with plastic fitting should not be marked as heavy duty!
I have had the root feeder for deep watering of new trees.  I insert the root feeder slowly allowing the soil to soften.
The dvice has held up well but I suspect it would not hold up to too much force while inserting the feeder."
1.0,"followed all instructions, water did not drain as was directed. It seems like it just helps to remind you to water your tree."
5.0,Won't be able to use this product until at least spring.  It looks good. I was impressed with how soon I received it.
5.0,"I had another deep watering spike that got clogged and just never really worked that well. I used this one last summer to try to save our huge pecan trees from the intense heat wave, and it worked great! Our pecan trees are still alive and many of our neighbors lost theirs. I moved it around our trees in a spiral pattern. I moved it once in the morning and once in the evening, and it seemed to work like a charm. After an entire summer of use, it still looks almost new."
4.0,"It turned out that this device cannot poke through our hard clay soil, so we cannot really use it to fertilize the trees, which is why we got it in the first place.  Works great for our roses in the tilled garden, and the results are instantaneous.  No waiting for the fertilizer to penetrate the soil."
5.0,It does it's intended job well and was very affordable compared to many other I had looked at. I like that you can order replacement parts instead of having to purchased an entire new one.
5.0,this bamboo bundle is perfect for framing a Scrog and for hanging stuff from a grow tent frame. get some!
4.0,"The price is right and these are quality stakes, however the green coloring does come off onto your hands as you use them."
5.0,Love these - it's the best way to get water to the tree roots. We have had trouble with them plastic top breaking several times but overall we will continue to buy them. There is nothing else as good.
5.0,"It is a great tool in the Texas heat to save money on the water bill and save the landscape as well. Because the plants and trees get watered and it is not evaporated by the heat, plus doesn't require much water."
3.0,"broke pretty quick, didn't last long at all, hard to get into the ground. Works well but fell apart pretty quick"
4.0,"This is the second 'Feeder' we bought.  Our ground is full of clay, rock solid, and my advice is to use this fertilizer applicator after a heavy rain so it's easier to push into the soil.  And watch for rocks when pushing it down, into position.  Be careful of the water pressure too and make sure it isn't so hard it cracks the plastic cap.  In other words, yes this is a great product but baby using it.

These are extremely handy and do a deep root fertilizing, right to the roots.  Our fruit trees did really well this year due to this feeder."
2.0,Not for use with large trees. The feeder rod does not generate enough pressure to make holes in any hard soils. I live in Virginia where the soil is not that hard and struggled to get holes to the depth required. It clogged often with mud and did a very poor job of dissolving the refills. I suspect I may have had old refills as I can not see how anyone would deal with the 30 to 45 minutes it took for one to partially dissolve in the root feeder. It sounded like a great idea but cheaply designed. All in all a very frustraiting attemp to fertilize my trees. The Ross root feeder would be better suited on small trees where few holes are required and the ground is soft.
5.0,There is a local gardening show on the radio every Saturday morning in Columbus Ohio. The host is always suggesting that you root feed your trees and small shrubs. I never thought too much about it until I bought this root feeder. Wow! Root feeding does make a difference. My only advice is to make sure you shop around for the feeder refills. I found the best price for those is on Amazon. If you go to the big-box stores you will pay a lot more for the same product.
5.0,This was a replacement for a broken item so I know how this works. Looking forward to using it in the Spring.
5.0,"Love the root feeder. It works great and has no leaks, which is hard to find with any garden hose hookup!"
5.0,I used it many years. This is a replacement for my 10 years old one. The metal is made of tough steel. I may rust a little bit. I have clay type of soil. The tip will never block. I use it with both ROSS feed and Miracle Grow.
1.0,This item does not work. I think it is a 2nd or something. I have two the ross root feeders but this one is a bad one.
4.0,"I like these, but several broke.  They are not sturdy, so you can only use them with smaller plants."
4.0,"These did the job for keeping my dog away from new landscaping recently planted.  Some of the stakes did fade to material base color, that is the green washed away, and left a light brown ""bamboo"" color.  Other than that, they are still going strong.  They are pretty thin so, make sure you are holding them when pushing down, they will break with too much lateral force."
1.0,Faded very quickly and half lasted 60 days before breaking up in AZ sun
2.0,Be careful the paint rubs off easily on your hands after handing them.
4.0,What I was looking for.
1.0,Very weak stacks. Will never buy again
5.0,"Work as expected, good value."
5.0,The 3 feet bamboo stakes worked great for bushes in the garden. They are sturdy and at the same time easy to cut for smaller plants. Will definitely purchase again.
2.0,"Most broke as I pushed them in, got a splinter too."
5.0,"Exactly what I needed to stake plants. These have lasted several seasons. The green wears off, but not a problem."
5.0,"I purchased this to replace a 30-year old Ross Feeder that I had borrowed from a neighbor. The old one was all metal and I really did not expect this part plastic one to be as good. To my surprise -- and my neighbor's --  they have made significant design improvements and provided more strength in the metal rod which bent easily in the old one. I especially like the easy flow adjustment lever. Can't testify to its durability yet, but It comes with a complete list of low cost replacement parts and looks solid to me."
5.0,Easy to use and the price is right. A great way to water newly-planted trees. I'm glad I bought it.
3.0,"After pushing into the ground a few times, there is a small amount of spray coming from the underside of the handle near the off/on lever. Doesn't appear to be headed toward being as durable as my old Ross root feeder which was made of metal. It is still working perfectly after many, many years of use."
5.0,"This is very easy to insert into the ground, all the way down to the roots. I highly recommend it."
5.0,Still very high quality. Had one for over twenty years. Still working ok!! Using tool is the best way to water shrubs and trees. I use it for my roses!!
5.0,Just put it in the ground and hook it to the hose and its works great! Loved how easy this was
2.0,"I am probably among the last to applaud the benefits of this product. It flows water and/or fertilizer to the roots and is especially beneficial when I see a tree or shrub wilting from the heat. I have one that is probably 20 years old. The water flow is very strong. Since I now have a half acre lot, I thought I would order another. The current version pales by comparison. It is shorter length and the water flow is weak. Materials are poorer as well."
5.0,"The Ross Root Feeder is one of the best ways to water and feed roses, and also azaleas!  This is not the first one I've had.  It replaces one that is very old and the end of the tube wore out.
When I discovered Amazon carried their products a few years ago, I was delighted.  I could no longer find the cartridges around my home.  This summer I needed a new feeder and am pleased with the improvements they have made.  I HIGHLY recommend them to any one, even if you just use it for watering."
4.0,"Several others have reported this problem and I also experienced it. After a Summer of use, the connection where the hose goes in simply broke, almost cleanly around the 'shell"" that has the threads for connection. That part would be easy to replace if the replacement was available.  Haven't found it anywhere so far.  A fix would be to make the part available, or a redesign with a more substantial connector shell. Otherwise, the product works very well."
4.0,I don't know if this is by design but very low water flow came throw this one.  I remember the one I used as a kid sprayed really hard.  also this has a lot of plastic so not sure how long it will last.  that being said it works pretty well and I love that I can add fertilizer into the bowl.
2.0,does not worth the money.
3.0,Very handy if you have soft soil. Hard soil? May shatter if you drive it. Just something to keep in mind.
2.0,These are very weak and broke while trying to hold up my plants. Also has green dye that comes of on your hands! Wont be using them.
5.0,wash green paint off before use
3.0,They hold small plants together.if they were taller could have been better
4.0,They were dyed so I didn't use them.
4.0,"Purchased these for a yard game and they work great! The only thing I don't care for is when they got wet, they discolored my hand. Otherwise, a great purchase for what I needed them for."
5.0,"Just what I needed for staking dalihas, tall and top heavy but light weight.  Bamboo stakes strong enough for that.  One of 25 stakes was smaller in diameter than a straw and broke when I tried to push it into soil.  Would buy again."
3.0,"Didn't need to use them, but I was hesitant to use them once i opened the package because the green coloring just comes off on your hands."
3.0,A lot of bent and thin  skewers look like seconds
5.0,These are a really nice size and strong enough without being a big clunky stick.  They are going into their second season now.
5.0,loved them
3.0,"Great price, although the blue paint comes off on your hands quite a bit."
5.0,Handy with new plants.
5.0,These were not dyed green and I prefer that! Great product!!!
5.0,These 3 foot bamboo stakes are relatively strong and come in handy for so many situations in the garden.  Not only for staking but helping to guide ground vines in the right direction or to help prop something from blowing over.  So satisfied with purchase that I just ordered more.  I received a quality product for a fair price and just ordered more.
4.0,"Ordered these to support a young avocado tree and some tomato plants. Did the job exactly as described. Really liked the green color, but the color would transfer to every surface it touched (hands, clothing, etc). Would recommend to any pro or amateur gardener, just wear items you don't mean being tinted slightly green!"
5.0,Great Sticks. Sturdy.l Well worth a little extra cost; but superior product.  You'll lik'em
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were not green, hence no dye coming off. They are regular brown bamboo sticks & are perfect for what I need. I couldn't find what I wanted in my local store, so was glad  I could get them from Amazon."
5.0,work great in the garden
5.0,"I purchased 20 or so new trees for the yard.  Some Coulmnar Sweedish Aspens, some Maples, some Birch trees etc.  My family loves trees so we have really loaded the yard and it is turning into a real garden paradise back there.  However I worried about the trees making it and wanted to make sure I gave them the very best shot they could have at living and flourishing.  After all it is enough of a pain to dig a proper hole for a 15 gallon tree, having to do it 2 1/2 times (1 to plant, 1 to remove, and then clear it out enough to get a replacement tree in there) warranted the cost of trying to use something like this.

I also purchased the fertilizer ""bars"" that are necessary for the types of trees that I planted here on Amazon.  I read the directions, I know I know not very adult of me but I wanted the give the trees the best shot.  Was surprised to read that even tho the bar is about 24"" long you should only push it into the ground 12"" for a more mature tree and 6"" for a new smaller tree.  As I had both I have tried both.

I got it in place at the drip-line surrounding the tree.  Well to be honest I kind of cheated.  Having just planted the tress I could tell right where the dig line had been as there is no grass in that location.  So I measured and just kind of eyeballed the depth.  I worked my way around the tree line following the directions and used a bunch of the little bars as needed.

While I can't guarantee it was the cause, as well they are living things and vary as a result, the aspens basically doubled in height the first year and put on about 6', yes that is feet, in height.  This second year in the ground they have done about another 4'.  And are really starting to provide a wall of green and some shade in the setting sun.

The Autumn Blaze Maples have shown less vigor than the Aspens, but they are all alive and seem to be doing well.  They were larger trees and in my experience they take longer to get their root systems establishes than the smaller trees.  I was trying to short circuit that with larger trees but should probably have just bough the smaller younger trees.

In any event all are doing well and have survived the snows of winter, and the raging heat of summer.

The Ross root feeder is very easy to use.  I turn off the value on the handle, and turn on the water at the spigot.  Then I walk to where water is needed and I push it into the ground to the right depth.  Open the clear cap on top with just a few twists and then put in the fertilizer and replace the cap.  (As a side note I have only ever used the Ross the pellets with it but they work and so I am happy with it.)  I then found a small trick.  i pull the Ross Root Feeder back up about 1/4 of an inch.  Just a slight lifting.  Then I open the value and look and listen for water flow.  Some times with the soil around here it was block and no water would flow.  With the slight lift the never happens.  I don't typically open the valve all the way and instead only open it about 3/4s of the way.

It takes a while to dissolve the fertilizer pellet so I set a timer I stole, I mean borrowed, from the kitchen and let it run for the amount of time I wanted in each position.

Then I lather rinse and repeat the process.  Turn off the valve, pull it out of the ground, walk to a new place, push it in to the right depth, uncap add a pellet recap, lift up slightly, turn on the valve to about 3/4s and start the timer counting down again.

It does seem to help and it definitely gets water down past the flowers and other plants that surround some of the trees.

For me it was a great purchase and I would do it again and have recommend it to others.  This one is actually my second one.  The first one was going strong a decade ago when I  bought it for my first home.  But 3 moves later... it was just gone so it was time to replace it.

The only con I can think of?  Getting the little ones to leave it alone while it is working and they are out in the yard. :)"
4.0,"Is a great product, would b better if the top was metal not plastic. Plastic does not hold up well in southern states heat"
4.0,"This does a great job of watering tree roots on new plantings. No water is wasted on the surface,it just goes right to the root ball. The arbor vitae in my yard love it."
4.0,Saw commercial ones that are a bit heavier but no longer available. This is sturdy enough and the pellets Re a easy fit.
2.0,"Got this in the spring of 2012. Went to use it again in June this year, and the plastic part that attaches to the garden hose broke off while I was threading it on . Good concept, but not built to last."
1.0,"I had successfully used the metal Ross root feeder in the past.  This plastic version did not work.  After reading the instructions carefully, I inserted 1 refill pellet into the refill chamber, connected the garden hose and barely turned on the water.  The feeder control was in the OFF position and water poured out of the two holes on either side of the On-Off control.  Only a few drops of water came out of the tip of the shaft.  Turning the control from OFF to ON to OFF  and spots in between had no effect. I called the manufacturer explaining the problem and they sent a replacement diaphragm washer to hopefully solve the problem only it did not.  Amazon's supplier, Grady's Online, has agreed to refund the price paid."
5.0,Recommended by our arborist to assist a tree that we had that was in trouble.  Haven't been able to use it yet as we are still waiting for our tablets/fertilizer.  But he said it is a great product.
4.0,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT. USED ACCORDIND TO DIRECTION AND THE RIGHT ROSS FERTILIZER, IT GETS THE FERTILIZER DIRECTLY DOWN TO THE ROOTS."
5.0,"Saved several of our trees from the drought. Really great product.easy y
To use. Neighbor purchased one after seeing how well they worked."
5.0,"Neil Sperry, a Texas gardening expert says that every gardener should have one of these. Its easy to use and I'm sure my trees are going to look amazing"
5.0,Great
5.0,Works great for indoor plants but the green dye wears off on my hands. I haven't tried it outdoors to see how the color and integrity holds up.
3.0,Thinner than I thought. Can't put much pressure down on them.
5.0,Great price and fast delivery! I will be building bamboo teepees for my garden climbers. I saw these on a gardening video and was pleasantly surprised by the low price and Amazon Prime expedited shipping!
5.0,they are strong and most are very straight  I would buy them again
5.0,They are just as described.
5.0,My Moringa trees are already standing straighter.
3.0,"I bought these stakes to help support some bean, pea, cucumber and bittermelon plants that we have growing in our garden.  The stakes were all good length although the diameters all differed slightly (from 1/4"" to 5/8), but thats to be expected from normal bamboo sticks.  We actually have a little bamboo forest in our backyard, so I could have easily gotten some sticks there, but this product came with a protective, green coating which I though would help the wood last longer during the rainy winter (we live in the tropics).

Unfortunately, that green coat is now the reason I only gave 3 stars.  While placing the stakes in the garden, I noticed my hands were turning green after gently touching the stakes.  No biggie, I thought.  Must just be excess from manufacturing.  But then I checked on our garden today, 3 days after putting the stakes in, and after 2 days of rain.  There are green spots on the soil under each of the stakes where the coating has washed off the stakes.  The top 1/4 of the stakes are now bare and saturated with water.  Looks like I would have been better off just spraying my backyard sticks with something from the local hardware store...this green coating is a joke.  And I certainly hope its not poisonous since it so readily transferred to my skin and the soil."
5.0,worked great very fast
5.0,worked very well for propping tall garden plants
1.0,"I just purchased the Ross 1200D ""Heavy Duty""?? Root Feeder.  I suspect the ""D"" Model is a new Chinese version that is poorly manufactured.  Everything is plastic except for the feed tube, very fragile, leaks easily and the ""steel"" feed tube and tip are not steel but some type of weak aluminum, alloy or pot metal.  The tip is a separate piece that is not removable and is made of an even softer metal which promptly caved in when trying to push it into my fairly hard soil.  The tip broke (caved in after 5 uses) with just normal hand pushing and not even trying to force it into the soil.  Also, the connection to a hose is flimsy and poorly made so it leaks continuously even after putting in a new washer.  Overall, I am totally dissatisfied with this poorly made product!  If this is supposed to be the "" Heavy Duty"" version of this item, I'd really hate to imagine what the lite duty version of this would be.  The handle and housing should be made of metal and the watering shaft and tip should be at least some type of steel.  A magnet does not stick to  the tip or shaft so they are not ""steel"".  Bad product and bad manufacturing.  Unfortunately, the design is great and very convenient if the materiel's were stronger.  Now I have to try and get a replacement shaft and tip which according to the instructions should come apart but after looking at the unit, seem to be glued into place and I'd probably break it removing the feed/watering tube.  Still waiting to hear back from the selling company.......................they're on vacation!"
5.0,we really likes that it supplies water to the roots because our roses are planted on an incline and just regular hose watering does not allow the bushes to be properly watered.
3.0,"I had a Ross root feeder that lasted me more than 20 years.  It was made of metal (none rusting) and glass.  The glass broke last year.  I ordered this 1200C to replace it.  I broke the second feeder on the first use.  The plastic hose connection snapped off when I pulled the feeder out of the ground.  I gave up trying to find a replacement for the broken part and ordered a third feeder this year.  It workes fine, but I hold it real close to the center when pushing the feeder into and pulling the feeder out of the ground.  It is not heavy duty, treat it gently and it can last."
5.0,The first one I had lasted for years. It came time to get a new one but could not find in any hardware store (big chain store or local hardware).  The tree roots are getting the fertilizer and water they need and are already looking better.  Thanks Amazon for finding this root feeder.
4.0,It works fine and after reading previous ratings-I took the precaution to insure handle is treated carefully. It is not even close to the quality of construction of previous units I have purchased years before.
5.0,"I have sedge and Johnson grass in my flower beds.  They must be pulled, getting all of the root.  I water slowly as I slide the spike along the stem, then pull.  Works very well.  I have had mine for several years and hope that the current product is as good."
5.0,This gadget filled the bill for me.  It enabled me to deep water a large ash tree where i do not have sprinklers.
4.0,"It's good and serves its purpose, but older models seemed to be sturdier.  New model is tight and does its job well."
2.0,"I first purchased a Ross Root feeder back in 2000 or so.  I still have my original purchase - and I am still using it.  Since I have a lot of trees in the yard, I purchased a second unit a few years ago and both my wife and I would take a set of trees and deep root feed them.  After the second unit broke, we purchased what we thought was an identical unit.  The name has changed with the new HD title, but the unit looked the same in the pictures.  Wrong.  This latest unit has very low water flow, so the fertilizer does not dissolve.  And I am always having to unclog the holes where the water comes out.  I just hate the changes that Ross has made to the design over the last 10 years.  I understand that materials change and costs must come down, but the usefulness of the end product should not be compromised and it has been compromised greatly.  Now, I am going to continue to use this one, but when it breaks, I will probably just buy another brand next time."
5.0,This was a additional item to supplement one I bought years ago.  Absolutely terrific product; sometimes hard to find.  Recommend it to everyone!
4.0,"They are a good value.  The stalks are a bit thin, but they worked extremely well for support garden peas."
2.0,the color bleeds in a day or two.
3.0,Hey they are sticks whaddaya want?  The color does come off in your hand some.
4.0,Basic stakes that will serve its purpose.
4.0,"Exactly what is says.  Arrived in good shape, all sticks intact and usable.  I purchased based on price and don't feel cheated at all."
3.0,Green Paint washes off after a few rains.  Would get them again for the price.
5.0,"Came as advertised, inexpensive, does the trick."
2.0,the sticks are not sturdy and broke just using them for tomatoes
3.0,"I needed these out of season, so they were expensive."
4.0,The green coating comes off way to easy - so hard to work with without turning green
3.0,"a little disappointed with them...  don't know why they had to be tinted green, had green dye all over me...
not as durable as i had hoped...  had a few easily snap when placing them in the ground..."
1.0,These are not what I expected.  They are spray painted which is annoying.  The moment you touch them your hands turn green.  This made me hesitant to use them in my garden.  I ended up having to get an alternative.
3.0,Leaves green stain all over your hands.
5.0,Very useful all around the yard!
4.0,"Nice for staking up smaller garden vegetables and as a prime add-on, really inexpensive!"
4.0,"Works as expected, just do not like that the coloring/dye comes off when you touch them"
4.0,"I wore gloves when using these given the other reviews about the paint coming off. I didn't have any problems. It worked well as far as holding up my peonies. Even though my peonies are no longer in bloom, these stakes are still up."
4.0,Th color comes of on your hands while you are installing them. Otherwise they are ok.
2.0,"These are thin and breakable, also the paint comes off on your hands and is hard to get off. You get what you pay for, spend a bit more."
5.0,"These bamboo sticks are perfect for the vegetable garden. I bought them from Amazon so I would not need to leave the house. They work as expected for a good price. I just hope I can re-use them again for next year. plus I wish they were a little taller, but they will be just fine!"
3.0,"This is not a tool to be used w/o some attention to somewhat flimsy construction. Rocky soil makes tricky to use w/o breaking it. Used Gorilla tape to reinforce the top.

Recommend with caution."
5.0,Great for watering trees and plants without wasting lots of water.  Gets water right where you want to go.  It is hard to measure how much water is going down there though
2.0,"You need to be careful if you have caliche, roots etc. when you put this product in the ground. Mine cracked at the hose connection and leaks. This is a good process to water tree roots but the hose connection is weak and needs to be improved. This product is very inferior to the last one I bought that lasted twenty years."
4.0,"The root feeder implement is just what I expected of it.  Unfortunately, the one I ordered through Amazon was lost in transit.
Fortunately, I was able to locate one at a Menard's store; and it proved to perform like I hoped it would.  At least the store that I ordered it through on Amazon, credited my Mastercard account as soon as it was determined that it was not going to arrive at my address."
2.0,"The connection to the garden hose is very fragile and breaks easily, when this happens the feeder is useless. They should have made the feeder out of metal and charged a dollar or so more, instead they have parts on reorder since everyone needs to have it repaired."
4.0,I had a mountain ash tree that was foundering and this helped to bring it back almost to normal  We'll see what happens this year.
5.0,"My husband was so excited that I finally found a place to purchase him a new Ross Root Feeder. All the places we used to buy them from locally no longer handles them, so when I found them through Amazon, he was really pleased. Not only did we get some for our own use, he gave one to a friend who had never used one before. Now he is hooked on them too. Thanks to Amazon we can now water our trees and shrubs the way we like to."
5.0,"In a bad drought, I used more for water than feeding, worked great. I need to try the feeding this year."
5.0,"All the tree owners need one with the draught here.  Tree experts say that if your tree roots are not thoroughly watered during this draught,  in 2 years your tree will die.  Tree removal is expensive"
3.0,The ground is so dry I could not use this.  It was like jacknifing through concrete. I will pass it on
3.0,"Meh...you get what you pay for I guess.  They fulfill the minimal technical description of the product: 3ft. long bamboo sticks dyed green.  Unfortunately, there is some pretty wide variation in the diameter thickness, and therefore the strength, of these ""stakes"".  Calling these ""sturdy bamboo stakes"" is at best a stretch, and borders on disingenuous.  Almost all of the sticks in the package that I received have a fair amount of flex, and would be totally inappropriate for ANY tomato plant, mature eggplant, or large pepper plants.  They are adequate for medium to small pepper plants or potted vining plants.

As an aside...why bother dying them green with cheap dye?  Just leave them naturally colored and that would look better.  I might understand if it was some sort of protective painted coating to provide weatherproofing, but it's not."
3.0,"The ""green"" came off on my clothes and hands...my fault perhaps but annoying.  I think next time, I will hose them first and leave them in the sun to age before using them.  They are strong enough to hold gigantic lilies!"
4.0,"These are very sturdy, and they stand up great in passing summer thunderstorms. Only thing I don't like is how green dye comes off of these on my hands, or whatever else they touch."
5.0,"Great, Just wear gloves unless you want to look like you jerked off the Incredible Hulk."
5.0,Use these to steak my leaning flowers (gladiolas) that are top heavy!  Thanks!
4.0,"The green paint does come off easily, I read this in other reviews and will confirm. I just sprayed mine down with a hose until it was more of a green tent than actual green paint. I used them to hold up my pepper plants, broccoli, plants, and a few small whips. I live in a high wind area and these stakes are holding up great. I cut them down to size I need and the amount you get for the price is awesome. I will be able to use these for years to come."
3.0,"The items arrived in a giant box, from which when opened, the stakes poured out.  The product packaging was blown out on both ends, making these look like seconds or returns.  Green dye comes off on your hands and clothing like newspaper ink, so be careful!  But the plants won't mind the color coming off, and the price was right."
4.0,"It's your average bamboo stakes, it works okay, nothing amazing but not disappointing either. It's a stick that holds a plant up. This size isn't great for staking heavy plants though."
4.0,"These sticks work great for my tomato plants and are sturdy but I just wish they weren't dyed green, my hands turned green after handling it for just a few seconds."
5.0,These seem to be of the same thickness unlike others I have purchased in the past. The color is starting to fade from them over the past three weeks though.
4.0,"These stakes worked great, but make sure to wear gloves, as they will leave green residue all over your hands.  They kept my peonies standing tall! I recommend this product."
5.0,"They're a little thicker than a standard pencil, not completely uniform. some may be a bit thicker yet.  One of mine is quite bowed but that's fine..  I like the bamboo because it wears better being stuck in soil for long periods  and I find plants prop  much better with these than with plastic.
Just what I wanted and no nursery around here seems to have on hand."
5.0,"Great for my patio vegetable plants.  Although others complained about green color coming off on their hands, I found that not to be a problem as the transfer was minimal  and washed right off."
1.0,"This product is cheep it will leave your hands green from the cheep paint. I'm concerned about it leaching into my vegetables
."
5.0,"These plant stakes are exactly as advertised.  I left them out this winter, and they are still going strong.  Would buy again."
3.0,Good price. Only problem is that these were so heavily dyed they left my hands strained green when I removed one from the package.
5.0,"I appreciate the sturdiness of these stakes. (Okay, I wear gloves in the garden anyway. Who cares.) I cannot wait to get outside and use them."
4.0,"These are maybe a little tall, but otherwise work really well.  You also get a lot of them at a good price.  Twist ties stay up on them.  All in all a good product."
5.0,What could be wrong with green garden stakes?  The green came off on our hands but it washed right off' The consistency of the size was ok. They were strong enough to push into the ground.  They are keeping the chicken wire up and the rabbits at bay.
5.0,"Really? 25 three-foot bamboo stakes for a few bucks? Hard to believe, but true. I have staked my sunflowers, trellised my jasmine and built outdoor pigeon perches for less than a dollar each! And... I still have 10 stakes left and plenty of extra gardening budget to spread around. Perfect!"
5.0,havent used it yet with fertilizer but i've used it for watering my trees in the OK summers. Sturdy product and works like it's explained it should. No issues with water flow
5.0,"I coolant find one inane of the stores - all out!  With the drought, I truly feel this saved my trees."
4.0,"This is a good root feeder. With the drought we had this year, I used it frequently for watering the trees. Don't buy the cheaper model. Although not indestructible, it is more durable. As usual,Amazon shipped in a timely manner which is greatly appreciated."
1.0,"I recently purchased this product to deep water an orange tree.  After three probes into the ground, which was somewhat firm the tip broke off the end of the tube.
Checking the end of the tube there was three small spot welds used to hole the pointed water distribution tip onto the tube.  This product was a complete failure
and I would not recommend purchasing this product."
2.0,While this works great....after my 3rd use of it..the hose attachment that threads onto the hose separated in half leaving me no way to attach it to my hose. I just bought 35 boxes of refills too that I found on clearance. This is clearly not a heavy duty tool so be be carefull.
5.0,We used this to water during the drought this summer.  It was a life saver!  Plan to use as a feeding also.
3.0,We had an older model which was all metal and lasted several years. I have concerns about the plastic components which do not appear to be as durable. Care must be taken to prevent breakage.
5.0,"This was exactly what I expected.  Used it to water trees due to drout.  Saw improvement almost immediately.  Will use with fertilizer soon.

This was hard to find locally - yeah Amazon!"
5.0,I like this product so much I decided to find one for my son. He is also very much into his yard. It came in very handy during this drought we had this summer.
5.0,We are in a terrible drought and we have new trees! I have seen a significant difference in our Live Oak since we have started deep watering with our root feeder! It's a must have!
5.0,"Once I learned how to use it, this is by far my favorite toy. Nursery gardens, and home gardens all have weeds. Some weeders  disturb the soil a great deal, and others, like a push hoe, and this brier hook shave the weed at ground level. The advantage in not disturbing the soil is the seedlings, that you can't see, can thrive once they are not shaded by weeds.

To use the brier hook, grasp the weed near the top, and pull the hook across the base. The top blade section is a 1 inch push jabber that is marginally useful. The handle is not long, and I find myself holding it by the middle anyway."
5.0,What can I say but that I used it to make a few trellises for my tomatoes and squash with no problem.
5.0,"These are exactly as described. I purchased these to support seedlings I was planting in the early spring. They did, and are still doing a good job keeping the seedling upright even through several significant, windy storms. Yes, the green dye rubs off, but I usually wear gloves, so it wasn't an issue for me, especially considering the low price. I did get some green on my hands at one point, soap took it right off (soap is cheap, other bamboo stakes are not!). I actually bought a second pack anticipating more planting next Spring."
3.0,These bamboo stakes serve their purpose and were a great price.  They are holding up in my garden pretty well.  The green color does fade off of them tho.
3.0,"This is a great product at a great price. Downside, the green dye on the sticks will come off on your hands, not to sure what it is made of?
Not much else to say but amazon.com requires 20 words to leave feedback."
4.0,It's a great buy for the price. Its exactly what I needed in my garden and for some of my houseplants. I even cut some down to fi smaller plants. The color does run and get all over your hands so I had to drop a star. I wish they didn't paint it. It looks better natural in my opinion. Will purchase more in the near future.
4.0,Stakes are as advertised and I'm sure they will do a great job holding up my peppers.  Wear gloves though because they are coated in a green paint that will get all over your hands.  Great value.  Shipping was prompt.
1.0,"Do not buy this product!  Your hands will be completely green when you put these into the ground and you never know what chemicals are used.  If the color comes off that easily, imagine how much will get into the soil and into your plants."
4.0,I like these stakes because they are very sturdy for their size.  The stakes can be used in planters or pots and not damage the roots.
5.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for to stake up my young willow trees.  They're not super super strong, but good enough and great for the price!"
4.0,"These are bamboo stakes... nothing fancy, and the green runs off... but I didn't buy them for the color.  I think it is a good purchase and exactly what I needed."
2.0,"After using this a few times, it has been very difficult to connect the hose to the root feeder.  The hose will shoot out of the feeder and I believe this is causing the feeder to get stripped.  I think it should connect better."
1.0,The hose connector split during the first use of this product.  It was not overtightened it simply split after being attached to the hose and water was turned on. Very poorly constructed.
3.0,I've had ross feeders before so I was disappointed that this feeder would not allow me to adjust the flow of water precisely. The water is either full-on or just barely flowing. I use it mainly to water plants so I can adapt I guess.
3.0,The rubber seal must be refitted every time prior to use.  Product work but the engineering could have been a little better.
1.0,"While the Ross 1200C helped our new tree survive the drought of 2012, after only a few months the hose attachment snapped off. It certainly did not live up to being ""heavy duty.""

UPDATE!
After contacting the manufacturer last spring, the replacement parts still have not arrived - that's 5 months for those who are keeping track. Their customer service is non-existent. I sent a message thought their website form today and will update in a week or so whether or not I hear from them or receive the parts.
Since the manufacturer will not replace defective parts (or at least not in a timely fashion) I would recommend a more sturdy watering system, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yard-Butler-WST-1-Tree-Watering-Tool/dp/B000P7M740/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yard Butler WST-1 Tree Watering Tool</a>&nbsp;for watering and find an alternate way to provide the fertilizer.
If you buy the Ross, be sure to keep your package so you can return it if it breaks within the Amazon return period. It looks like going thought the manufacturer is a waste of time.
Good luck."
2.0,Ross Root Feeders are a good product but this model is too light weight for dry clay soil and will break at the neck.  Have had a heavier weight feeder and it has preformed very well over the years.
1.0,"I purchased this after my old one of about 20 years gave out this spring.  I was able to use the new one once on two new small trees.  With the current lack of rain in our area, I wanted to give them both a second deep watering.  I was able to start the watering using the feeder on the smaller of my two trees and was ready to do the second side (I water twice on each tree, once on each side) and pulled the feeder out.  As I moved it to the second side, away from the water source, the hose connection snapped.  As this is a major source of strain on the device, I was very surprised that this was so poorly constructed.  I will not buy another of this design and material.  I would like to be able to use my remaining supply of plant food that I have for the feeder, but so far have not been able to find another that will take any sort of feeding material in addition to watering."
5.0,"This Ross Root Feeder is the best.  With the drought, the ground is very hard and what little rain we get doesn't get to the roots for my trees.  This Ross feeder solves that problem and allows me to keep my trees well watered and well fed.  And the proof--we recently had some pretty severe winds here in Illinois and many trees lost branches--but not my trees.  While everyone around me had tree damage--my trees withstood the winds and came through great"
5.0,I have used this feeder for several years and it finally gave up. I was very satisfied with this product which is why I bought it again... Delivery was timely...
5.0,"Many years ago I purchased a Heavy Duty Root Feeder and used it many, many times to feed and water a PinOak tree that grew into a magnificant beauty.  The root feeder finally rusted out and I couldn't use it any more.  I have tried to purchase another one and couldn't find a store that carried.  This summer has been hot and dry and someone asked if I had tried to buy a root feeder from Amazon.com?  Never thought of it! But when I went to your website and found it was available, I was sooooo happy.  I ordered it, it was delivered, and we have used it!  Now we have a happy hickory nut tree in our new yard.  Charlotte Theile"
4.0,"This is my second Ross Root Feeder. Hose threads on the first one wore out, such that the device would not stay attached to the hose.... I bought a new, improved one to continue feeding the roots of my trees during the 2012 drought. It works very well, allowing me to just water or to feed and water at the same time. I can use it on small saplings or 60' mature trees. I don't waste water through evaporation, because the water is applied beneath the soil surface. Great device. Well built. Elegantly simple. I would recommend it."
2.0,"I had a Ross root feed years ago that was all metal.  It worked for a long time, but it broke a few years ago.  I could not find a replacement in any local stores, but I found this online.  Except for the metal stake that goes into the ground, this is all plastic and feels very cheap.  If you put too much force on it while inserting it into the ground, it starts to leak around the handle.  I doubt that it will last very long."
5.0,"This was not quite as handsfree as I had initially thought; but, pretty close.  You do need to re-insert the feeder/waterer around the perimeter of the leaf area of the tree.  (I 'hoped' to just put it in once and be done, lol!)  Still worth the time and money!!!  We are in the midwest in the midst of what some say is one of the worst droughts in recorded history.  It is a relief to be able to ensure minnimal evaporation and maximum control of water, as well as, fertilizer and systemic insecticide."
5.0,Wish the Ross were heavy enough to handle a timer on it.  You could then set for a time & do something else!
5.0,"The Ross root feeder is something I have used for years, the old one got stolen. This summer of drought I used it to deep water and feed a River Birch that was dropping massive amounts of yellowed leaves (lack of water and iron). Used with Ross green again pellets, the tree recovered fully in about three weeks.  Highly recommend this inexpensive tool to save valuable trees."
1.0,"The cheap plastic connector that connects to the hose broke right off the second time I used it.  The engineer who designed it should be fired.  Don't they do any product testing???  Very disappointed.  DON'T RECOMMEND!!
I subsequently emailed the manufacturer Easygardener...TWICE....about the problem.  They never responded! Their customer service is even worse than their products!!!"
5.0,"Does a great job, my only quibble.. you determine the amount of product to put in it by the size of your tree. My trees are young, but they still need 6 fertilizer tabs.... there is only room for 5. So, you have to add another after the others dissolve. Not a huge deal, but thought it was something to mention. EDIT: I realize, you are expected to move the location of the device to water around the tree, so maybe putting in more tabs THEN would work."
5.0,"I was unable to find this product in the big box stores in my area.  Went to Amazon, ordered it and put it to use immediately when I received it.  Saw a difference with a few newly transplanted shrubs that were in a root ball but withering.  Surface water did not penetrate the root ball. Used the root feeder to water the plants and the next day the withering stopped. It really works well."
4.0,"I purchased this root waterer because I live in Southern California and don't want to waste water.  I push the rod down in the ground next to several fruit trees I have and then turn on water.  I once killed a cherry tree by putting too much water on the roots, and the ground was so hard it didn't drain therefore causing the roots to rot.  So you have to be careful, and not over due it.  This Root feeder has a lot of plastic on it so it's not as sturdy as the original metal and glass one I had.  But if you handle it carefully, and carry it around by the putting your hand on the hose instead of the plastic body it should work just fine. It has shortened my watering time by quite a bit, no longer having to run water and let it soak down to roots.  I would recommend this device.  I have not used the feeding feature of this feeder.  It is a little shorter then the original one I owned, but you just have to bend over more."
5.0,"THE ROSS 1200C HEAVY DUTY TREE & SHRUB ROOT FEEDER 12044 WORKS JUST LIKE IT SAYS.  EASY TO USE AND SIMPLE.  YOU CAN USE THE ROSS FEED TABLETS OR DO LIKE I DID AND USED A POWDER FEED, JUST UNSCREW THE TOP PUT THE FEED IN AND SCREW IT BACK ON .  HAS 4  HOLES ON THE BOTTOM AND THIS ONE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT WILL RUST.  WORKS  GREAT JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR TO USE DURING THE HOT SUMMER.  ALSO GOT IT $10.00 CHEAPER THEN OTHER PLACES AND No SHIPPING charge OVER $25.00.  Items I order came in good condition .

Update :  Had this root feeder for about a year and the part where you screw on the hose broke .  Item was still in warranty, but found out they were having trouble getting parts.  A month later no parts still.  Finally got them to give me a refund."
4.0,"I am reordering this product after over five years of productive use. It has been a extremely useful fertilizing both a line of roses and a mature dogwood, which had been very stressed by a serious bout with anthracnose. Both plantings had intervening layers of ground covers, and the deep watering wand enabled me to deliver precisely the fertilizer needed for each individual plant, and those plants responded well. Nontheless my root feeder ultimately failed, and not for the most common reason given by these comments. I did not have a problem with thread failure at the hose connection because I had (while unaware of this problem) fitted my root feeder with a Gardena snap connector. I believe Ross makes a version of this snap connector, and they might want to consider including one (or at least recommending one) with this product. What caused mine to fail was my carelessness in not flushing the wand after each use. The accumulated buildup of soil and chemicals in a wet environment caused the outlet apertures to corrode shut. Ross might consider making a version with a stainless steel wand (which, I'm sure, would add to its cost), or at least posting a prominent warning in its written materials to fully flush after each use."
1.0,"I had my old Ross root feeder and after so many years it rusted out.
I order this new one......was a waste, it takes forever to deep irrigate trees or bushes.... finally I got and old one from a garage sale...
I use Ross fertilizers quite a lot ( good product ) but not the new feeders."
5.0,"Product was exactly as described, sent fairly promptly and I am happy with it.  I have used them (I bought 2) to water almost every day and I think they have helped my trees survive this drought."
1.0,I looked for a root feeder for several weeks and this one that I bought on Amazon is the best!  Both in structure and price.  Easy to use and has saved my trees during the horrible drought we are having in Texas.  It is sturdy and well made and I believe it will last for a long time.  BUT I was wrong!  It soon developed leaks and now it spurts from just about everywhere when I use it.  Very disappointed with that it did NOT hold up well.
5.0,"The Ross 1200C Heavy Duty Tree and Shrub Root Feeder is an excellent tool.  After spending an entire weekend combing the ""Big Box"" stores and multi-location nurseries looking for this tool (and getting strange responses from store personnel), I was finally able to find one on your website.  With the Texas drought testing our trees, the root feeder has enabled me to return my trees to a robust condition."
5.0,"In the drought here in East Texas this year, I have lost so many flowering plants and trees.  I knew of a root feeder from years ago that a cousin of mine had which he used on his trees in Dallas, so I started searching for one.  After fruitless searches at hardware stores, Amazon had them and at a fairly good price.  I am trying desperately to save my 25 year old white rose bush.  I am happy to report that there are new shoots coming out.  As the drought continues, I will continue the use of the Ross Root Feeder."
3.0,Used these and seemed to put my tree into early fall mode by changing the leaves. Turned the grass around the tree very green though.
5.0,"This is a four star item.  Great seller.  Fast delivery.  I highly recommend this root feeder.  I have a number of them and this is the way to go to water trees.  Plastic lasts only so many years so I always want to have extra root feeders on hand and this seller is great.  The trees really do ""perk up"" when the water reaches their roots and this is the best way to get water really far down to them.  But, be sure that you plug up the holes the root feeder created.  This can be done as you take the root feeder out of the ground.  Don't leave the holes there because the ground will dry out too fast.  It's easy to plug up the holes with the tip of the root feeder.  After you take the feeder out of the ground, just cut off the water supply with the on/off lever on the handle and plug the hole with the tip of feeder.  It's easy to do."
5.0,"This saved my maple tree. Over half of the leaves on this tree were parched. After 60 some-odd days of over 100 degree temperatures in Texas, my trees were dying. I had this shipped immediately to try to save them and this morning I found new growth on my my maple tree. I've been watering all of my trees from underground, keeping the water from evaporating and getting it right down to the roots where it's needed."
5.0,This is an astonishingly simple device and it is saving my trees (we're in the throes of a three-year-long drought in the Texas Hill Country.)The Ross feeder makes maximum use of water. That's particularly important since our water supply comes from on-site wells.
2.0,"I actually like this product and would have given it five stars but mine has broken after only a few times of use. It's also out of warranty as I bought it early last year. I have a possible solution that might prevent his from happening to others.

When this product worked for me it worked VERY well. It put fertilizer right where I needed it and this year my wife's roses look great.

The weakest part of this unit is where the garden hose connects. I am a stickler for making sure the connections are not cross threaded and I had this one on tight when all at once the hose just popped out of the connector. I put it back on making sure that it was tight but not overtightened. Again the hose popped out. When I attempted to reattach the hose the third time the connector would not accept the hose fittings. It cannot be used at all now.

I think part of what caused my problem was me carrying the unit around with the garden hose attached. Be sure and disconnect the hose after use.

If I were to purchase another I will attach a garden hose shut-off valve on it. That way I will not ruin the threads on the unit by constantly attaching and removing a garden hose from the unit itself I would be attaching it to the shut off valve instead.

If you are tempted to carry the unit around anyway with a garden hose attached I might have a solution for that too. I'd attach shut-off valve to the unit and reinforce it with duct tape. Maybe even wrap the tape around a couple of wooden dowels. It certainly will not look pretty but if it saves the unit from breaking it might be worth trying."
5.0,"With the horrible drought we're experiencing in Texas, I just wish I'd bought this sooner.  It's a great testament to its durability that it hasn't broken despite me trying to force it down into the concrete-like dried clay in my yard.

Even without the fertilizer sticks, this is a superb way to help out struggling trees.

Highly recommended!"
4.0,"We have lived here 1 year - new home and we have planted over 50 trees. We had no idea that this year would be HOT and DRY! A hose with a sprayer or a sprinkler just was not doing it. Too much wasted water! After using this twice watering is still time consuming, but not so much wasted water. I am ordering another one and my wife and I can cut the job in half. Great water saver, puts the water where it is needed....."
5.0,"I bought the Ross heavy duty root feeder a while back. I also found some cartridges for fruit trees. The feeder is easy use, feels very durable. I use it often, not only when I fertilized my peach and cherry trees, but I use it to water them as well, along with my raspberry bushes and my hedges along the side of my house. On those hot days when the sun can burn off any watering you do, it's nice to go under the ground and water your items directly. I'm completely satisfied with my feeder."
5.0,"We are currently in a drought and the results of deep watering, especially for trees that are in a grass yard is soooo important.  I hadn't used this product in years, but already see the difference in my trees from deep watering several weeks ago.  This product is actually better than the old model, easier to grip and has a tough tip to help penetrate hard ground.  I would sure recommend this product."
1.0,"This is junk.  I have gone through three of them over the years, the last one only last 2 months.  Here is what goes wrong with them:

1) The plastic connector where the hose connects to breaks off pretty easily.

2) The head - watering tube junction starts to leak

3) The metal probe that goes in the ground will become corroded pretty easily.

Think PLASTIC and junky metal when you consider buying this product."
5.0,"The bad winter nearly killed my oak tree. I started watering my trees at the beginning of spring and it didn't seem to help. All of the local garden centers don't even carry the Root Feeder anymore so the prices have gone up for this product online. I figured it's a small price to pay to get my tree to come back to life.

After the first week, I started seeing positive results already as some green leaves started showing. After a month, my oak tree is back to life. This product is simply amazing!"
4.0,"I have been using a root feeder on my trees for 10 years now.  I have a large yard with over 30 trees and I feed the trees 4 times a year.  So, my root feeder gets a lot of workout.  My previous root feeder came apart last year (again - after 10 years of usage) and I bought the same type of feeder again without hesitation.  Feeding trees via the roots makes my trees about the best trees in the neighborhood so I know the product works.  And since it lasted this long I feel I got my money's worth."
5.0,"I have this one, its heavy duty. On the cheaper model the handle breaks real easy... then you have to buy this one. Comes with instructions easy to use. I'm going to experiment with using those large fertilizer stakes (the ones you pound into the ground), breaking them into halfs or quarters and putting them in the Ross Root Feeder. The stakes are cheaper then Ross's pellets, get them at ACE when there on sale. I'll write this Summer when I do it."
5.0,"The Ross Root Feeder is a very good product and Amazon got it to me promptly.
Am very pleased"
4.0,"I fully expected to get the same 1200C as the one I am replacing.  I researched several websites to be sure I was getting what appeared to be the 1200C original design.  However, I was disappointed to see the feeder is 2-3 inches shorter than the original 1200C; I am pretty picky about design specifics in tools. Unfortunately none of the websites actually stated how long the penetrating rod is, so I could not determine if this was original design or not.  The head appears 99% accurate in regards to the one we have which is at least 10+ years old. I only hope it works as well, at least penetrating the soils at our small farm.  I will update on how well it actually performs this spring in penetrating the soil."
5.0,"I have had my Ross Easy Gardner for several years now, it works great year after year.  Definitely a very good value if you divide the cost over several years of ownership.  I believe I have had mine for 6 years now."
4.0,"Well it is nice to be able to add fertilizer while root feeding/watering.  If you are carefull handling the root feeder is works great but nothing seems to be manufactured to last these days ...this included.  Not every retailer has the root feeder models so this was a good deal easily found, after having scoured the town.  The steel models don't have the ""feeder"" capability so you're stuck with this....cheesy aluminum wand but with a brass tip, and plastic where the hose connection is which is where most of the stress is and where my other one broke.  If the hose connection at least was made with brass it would be an unbeatable product.  If you're carefull not to sling the hose around with it, it works great!"
5.0,"Ordered this item as a gift.  The item arrived broken, and Amazon promptly sent a replacement without any hassle.  (Thanks Amazon)  Mom loves this deep root waterer and fertilizer.  It has revived her dying trees from their drought situation.  And she finds it easy to move around.  She highly recommends it."
4.0,I had an arborist doing my deep root fertilizing for years but this year I decided to do it myself.  This product made it very easy!
2.0,"Anyone who still has, or remembers the original Ross Root Feeder, will be shocked by this item (and also the ""professional"" version).

It is cheaply made (plastic with a weak metal rod) and must be used with care. With those caveats, it does the job. I hope it will last the season. However long it lasts, I will not buy another of these -- unless they go back to the original product -- which was ""professional"" grade as there was only one grade! No rip-offs.

If they want to make these new types, the price should be MUCh lower."
5.0,"We have had a great deal of heat for the last two years here in Tennessee.  I have fairly young trees, ornamental, that I do not want to lose.  I use my Root feeder to get the water down to the roots without wasting the water and food into the trees system..  Really does the trick and it works like a charm.  In fact it works so well my neighbor was about to lose his fairly large trees and he had me order one for him and he saved his trees.  Great Feeder and Waterer."
5.0,A better way to water bacause it put's the water were you need it . You can all so water during the day and not have to worry about evaporation .
5.0,I first ran into the Ross Root feeder around 2000 when I built a new home and was looking at how to get my young trees established. Since then I have given several root feeders as gifts and it seems that no one has ever heard of such a tool until I give them one! I also buy the shrub and tree food refills that go in the top of the root feeder to add supplements to the root system. These have made a noticeable difference in the health of my trees and shrubs. It also helps you use far less water by putting the water in the ground instead of ON the ground and relying on absorption to get the job done. The plants are much more responsive. I only buy the heavy duty version now (this is the HD version) b/c I like the vastly improved handle over the original design. A+
5.0,Too bad I did not know about this product sooner. Works great and very easy to use.
5.0,good
5.0,Product works as expected.
1.0,Didn't fit. Through it away.
3.0,"Even though the part number matched the number in my user's manual, the spool would not fit into the Weed Eater. However, since the diameter of the line was correct, I was able to wind the line from the replacement spool onto my empty spool, and it works fine."
5.0,High quality item and fast delivery
5.0,Good delivery time. It is what it is. Fits and installs simply. Would recommend at good price point. Looks to be very durable.
5.0,I was pleased to find this product on line. It saved me time in running around and looking forit.  Good service. Stan
4.0,Just what i needed. Weed machine is quite old. didin't think these would still be available. Thanks
4.0,"Product works well, but trigger button requires rather heavy squeeze. This can be quite tiring afyrt a short time. Also tends to stop sporatically, but is easily restarted. Its strong enough to cut 3 or 4 foot tall weeds."
4.0,"Not quite as heavy (thick) steel as I expected. You know, if you get crabby about my review, then I just won't bother?!"
5.0,"I've never used a brush hook before. Glad I bought this one. It is well made, arrived sharp. The handle was untreated, so I put some polyurethane on it. This brush hook has endured weeks of hard use without breaking or bending. This is a versatile tool. I believe it is safer to use than either an axe or a machete. It is also fun to use, despite its cumbersome appearance. Great for clearing/maintaining trails."
5.0,"I could not find a brush hook with the ax-type handle locally, so I used Amazon.com. It took a couple weeks to be delivered, but I kind of expected that with such an odd-shaped package. The blade came razor-sharp, ready to use. The curved handle feels ergonomic, and is considerably lighter than the standard 40"" round wood handle. This makes a big difference after about half an hour of chopping brush!"
5.0,Bag-A-Bug lures and bags work!  The Japanese Beetles eat everything in my garden.  With these lures and bags I am eliminating at least 1000 bugs a day from my garden.  The product is simple to use and the lures last all season.  I will definiately be purchasing these again for next summer!
5.0,these things really work!
5.0,Aways need extra bait but can't find them.
5.0,My garden loved these things.  The beetles who died while having sex with them... not so much.
5.0,Does the job well.
5.0,Saved my garden from these bugs.
5.0,ok
5.0,This trap system works great but you need to make sure that trap is not close to the house or you WILL regret it.  The bag needs to be changed at at the full mark and not later.  One thing you need to be aware of is that these nasty creatures secrete an immense odor that will plague you until trash day.  Plan accordingly but I absolutely recommend it.
5.0,This is the ONLY sure trap I have found...and it is still catching in mid September. Hurray
5.0,quick delivery great price
5.0,"The lures are long lasting and do a wonderful job job of ""luring"" the beetles.  They reduce the damage to my wife's prized roses."
5.0,works just fine.
3.0,Caught lots of beetles before they are all my roses !!
4.0,Product as expected
5.0,Awsome
5.0,Just what I wanted
5.0,1
5.0,"The Bbtles come to the attractant in swarmed.  You get your bugs & the Neighbors.  I had to empty my bags daily at first, then every other day. My attractant kinda died before the season ended."
5.0,This lure works!  I mean really works!  If you have Japanese beetles you need to get rid of I highly recommend this.
5.0,works well
4.0,"Works as hoped,took to long to get here"
5.0,Put them out and a day laterr you have a bag full of bugs.
5.0,These things are fantastic. Caught three bag loads in a day.
5.0,Keeps the beetles out of my swimming pool once I got it in the right location.  Works great!
4.0,This is a great product but the bags fill up quickly so buy extra.
4.0,Decent price for quantity.  Slightly cheaper than local stores are offering.
5.0,This product is awesome. Does the job I needed it to do. Been using this product for 4 years now and will continue to buy them
5.0,"these are the best.  Well, the best would be putting down insecticide in the early spring and head alot of them off at the pass  :-)  The picture reflects about 5 days - Saturday to Wednesday.  I should have set more traps up."
5.0,Love these bags only thing that helps deal with the Japanese beetles. Great service.
5.0,"What can I say, they definitely work. I have never seen so many Japanese beetles. I must be drawing them from all over the neighborhood :).
Very effective bait in these traps."
3.0,ok
5.0,"Works great. Attracts Japanese Beetles and drops them in the bag. Exactly where I want them. Once setup, I really notice a huge dropoff in Japanese Beetle sightings"
1.0,"Got the box but it only had one lure in it, box said 2. Double the price is more than slightly irritating."
5.0,As advertised and arrived on time.
4.0,"I use it every year from June 1st through growing season.  While it does not attract all the Japanese beetles, it does attract and capture quite a few. Less on the vegetable crop is a good thing ofcourse."
5.0,"I was going on vacation for 2 weeks just as the beetles arrived and began to eat my cherry, peach, and buckeye trees.  I put the lure over a 5 gallon bucket of water with soap.  I put a deflector up for the beetles to hit as they flew around the lure.  When I came back from vacation, all the trees were ok, with only 3-4 beetles per tree.  The bucket had thousands of dead beetles in it.  I will use this every year starting in mid June in Ohio.  Great product."
5.0,"These Lures work and you can use them over and over.  I just replace the bags.  That way it is much cheaper.  When they get dry, I just wet them and they still attract the beetles."
5.0,"OMG - I've never seen so many beetles in my life. It was so effective that I had to take it down. I placed it more than thirty feet away from everything but I noticed that some of fruit trees were eaten to shreds. I just bought this to protect two climbing hydrangea plants but I will just spray those with something else. I'm hoping I didn't introduce a bigger problem to my yard because they all seemed to be mating. It seemed like beetles were flying in from all over. Anyway, effective for sure...but make sure you keep an eye out for any other plants/trees that might be caught in the crossfire."
4.0,"It works as advertised, but I was capturing cumber beetles with it also before they combined the sex lure and the floral scent. We still need to get those cumber beetles."
1.0,As stated you only get one lure. The traps come with ONE DUAL lure for male and female beetles. This 'refill' gets you one single lure not a dual lure.
5.0,These traps work really well to control Japanese bettles and save my green beans from destruction.
5.0,attracts from long range.
5.0,"Keeps those darn Japaneses beetles (the shiny gold ones) from devouring my flowers.  By season's end, bag is full of dead bugs.  They prefer the bait scent to my garden."
4.0,works very well
5.0,IT DOES THE JOB
5.0,"If you're battling Japanese beetles, and just need the lure (NOT the bags or frames), this is what you're looking for!"
1.0,Have not caught a single bug.
5.0,Yes
3.0,Worked good
4.0,"great product, great delivery.  Very satisfied"
5.0,No problems.  It functioned as intended.
5.0,Worked as expected.
5.0,"It's known, It works, It is just a matter of looking for the best price!"
2.0,"As it was written up, I assumed there were two in each box which was not the case"
5.0,Worked as advertised
5.0,What I needed
5.0,"Wonderful for getting rid of Japanese Beetles, we caught hundreds in the first week between 3 bags. The beetles were destroying our many Hybiscus plants. Not any more."
5.0,"These worked great for me - caught a LOT of beetles, which is easier than trying to pluck them off my roses."
3.0,They seem to work. For the price i should catch enough to clean the county.
5.0,incredible product  it saved my fruit trees
5.0,This is by far the best beetle trap on the market. I was really pleased with this product. Works great!
5.0,Like
5.0,Great product. Really works!
2.0,Japanese beetle trap 2 ( replacement lure). But there is only one lure.
5.0,"These are the only thing that works! I wish these were not so hard to find in stores. If I did not use these, everything in my yard would be eaten up. These protect my trees and plants and I love that I can use it without a bunch of chemicals being sprayed all over the place. They jump into this back like it is crack!! I don't mean a few dozen bugs. I mean hundreds of beetles in no time. I love Bag a bug products and use them every year."
5.0,These really are good and work.
4.0,Nice
1.0,the bait did not attract bettles.  don't know if it was too old or what.
5.0,Great!
5.0,Best thing since sliced bread...just ask the japanese beetles. They love it (insert evil laugh)!
4.0,"Good, prompt service."
5.0,Work fantastic&delivery was right away.thanks
5.0,"Shipped quickly, Item works as advertised - Great product!"
5.0,bags full of japanese beetles. Saved my tomato plants.
1.0,"Terrible.

 Terrible."
5.0,works as expected
5.0,Worked as expected.
5.0,"I'm not sure what is in this lure, but it does a fantastic job attracting the Japanese beetles!!! Wonderful product! I am so happy to have found something that works so great!"
1.0,"I purchased the replacement lure for my existing trap, but it is not attracting beetles.  It has had no effect at all after a couple of days.
I need to lure the beetles away from my fruit trees, so I am very disappointed with this product.  I'll be trying a different brand from now on."
5.0,I looked everywhere to find this product as beetles were eating my roses.  This works just so you center the station AWAY from your roses.
5.0,Its a bag.  Holds up well.  If you have Japanese beetles this is part of the solution.
2.0,"Pros: Its Aluminum, its very light weight and carries garbage cans
Cons: Build Holes did not line up that great a couple of the assembly holes were actually bigger than the screw head that was used for assembly, punch machine didn't  actually punch a whole, it ripped aluminum open, had to use washers so screw head head wouldnt pull through, a couple of the aluminum bars were dinged up, I guess from machining, when assembled didn't sit straight it was twisted, maybe my fault.... Listen I know its a garbage can cart but really for 50 bucks maybe I would get a better @uality item, 50 bucks is still 50 bucks......period.
Update:: 2016 Item bent cannot handle any decent weight will have to modify for strength
Update:: 2018 Ended up in the same garbage cans it carries...trash"
4.0,"4-1/2 Stars.
Easy to assemble.
Framework Materials of good quality.
Seems to be sturdy and easy to use.
Wheels a little chincy but seem to work
Yes I would recommend this over all the others I've looked at."
5.0,"I purchased this cart as a gift for my in-laws since theirs was falling apart. I bought it in response to the reviews, as this one had the highest rating. It was very easy to put together and holds large trashcans and recycling bins. It is lightweight and easy to roll, but is well built. I'm thinking of buying one for us, too!"
5.0,This appeared to be the best quality of cart that was available to purchase.  It has made transporting the garbage to the curb much easier.
4.0,"This handcart from Amazon is used to take my garbage cans up my steep driveway on collection days.  I bought it to replace one that had worn out after many years of use.  It was purchased based on mainly good reviews and one which said easy assembly.  It was not easy for me because I could not make the bolt holes line up.  I decided those particular bolts were simply not essential and have been using it without them with no problem.  The cart is very light but strong and moves very smoothly.  Another reviewer complained about the wheels, but I find them just fine.  It is a big improvement over my old hand cart which was very heavy.  I manage to fit two 30# garbage cans and a recycle bin on this one."
4.0,"This item is as I expected it would be. I bought it because the raccoons were getting into our trash and I wanted the trash bins to remain upright. This cart does the trick, so I am pleased. It is not particularly attractive or heavy weight, but it was easy to assemble. The wheels aren't great (they are plastic, not rubber), but I cannot complain."
5.0,Great do not have to carry two cans to the curb can just wheel them out in one trip.
4.0,"I ordered this with the help of a telephone customer service agent with Amazon. After searching all of the local hardware and building supply stores in my area I went to Amazon.com. I was unable to locate the item so I called their Customer Service line and within a few min's she had found it for me. I was very suprised at the quality and ease of assembly and used the cart for several years before I moved. The movers broke it during transit so I am ordering another. I can highly recommend this ""Trash Can Cart"" for anyone needing to move two refuse cans to the curb with ease."
5.0,Trap did the job. Kept those nasty beetles off my Rose bushes
4.0,"This is only the LURE. If you are reusing bags year to year, this is what you want. If you are looking for something to trap beetles, look for the bag with the lure."
5.0,"great customer service, item as described"
5.0,This is the pest Japanese  beetle lure I've found.  It saw me through this season of the pesky insects.
5.0,I love this product. It works perfectly to keep the beetles off my roses and raspberry bushes and lures them directly to the bag. The bait/lure has allowed me to capture 3 bags full of beetles!!!!
5.0,works great sorry it is discontinued
5.0,"The beetles  this year are every where! I couldn't keep them out of pool. They ate my roses. When I hung the lure, the bag filled immediately and the bug problem ended."
1.0,"Notice that the product description says ""Replacement Lures"", plural.  I thought that was what I was getting, more than one. I didn't read the fine print on the pictured box closely enough.  Just one included.  So not really a great deal... you can get  the whole system cheaper, and faster..."
5.0,"This is a misleading post by this seller. I just bought these exact lures at Lowe's YESTERDAY, July 11, 2014. They are most certainly not discontinued, and they are most certainly not this high price. I paid $4.97 plus my local tax, which was nothing close to the $2.99 shipping fee you will be charged by this seller. Go to your local Lowe's, Home Depot or Wal-Mart before wasting your money.

And, yes, the product is far superior than any other. You will be attacked by beetles before you can even get the lure into the trap (they're harmless....just horny).

UPDATE NOTE July 21, 2014: The seller has changed the price on this item to make it ""free shipping."" We all know that nothing is ""free,"" so be aware that the seller has simply increased the price to include the shipping charge. Unfortunately, the seller did not choose to tell you the truth, i.e. this product has NOT been discontinued, and you can purchase it at Lowe's and Home Depot. These stores may be out of them this late into the season, thus the high prices all over the internet for any of these products. I recommend that you purchase replacement lures and extra bags each season for the next season. Lures can be kept fresh by sealing with a vacuum sealer, such as a FoodSaver, for YEARS. I'm in Virginia, and the beetles were at pestilence level this year. We have had to replace our bags every single day for over a week after five or more years of not even filling the four we put out every year. Beetles bury eggs in the ground for emergence the following year, so getting as many as possible will cut down on the number you see the following year. Get LOTS of bags, even if you don't use them all in one season."
5.0,Very effective product be sure to place away from flowers and people because it attracts beetles to that location. Be ready to change bag.
2.0,"I bought it because it was advertised for use to water ""small areas"" which is what I needed, but didn't really like this product.  The watering pattern was sloppy and inconsistent, and water pooled up in the area immediately around the sprinkler.  Try instead the Gardena 8125 Minizoom Oscillating Sprinker (also designed for small areas), which I am very satisfied with. . ."
1.0,I bought it for the narrow rectangle setting and the spray was very uneven. I have used a couple of others of this design and this is worse than one and no better than the other.
2.0,"It's just little holes drilled into plastic. Attach a hose and it flops over on it's side. It weighs about as much as a pencil. I had to weigh it down with a big rock on the ""handle"" then prop up the hose. Will probably last one season then spend another five hundred years in a landfill."
5.0,"I have a square garden about 20ft by 20ft.  With our old sprinkler that was one long line that rotated back and forth, we'd end up watering lots of area outside the garden, including our fence, the rocks around our pool, etc.  It was very difficult to get just the garden area.  Now, I put this baby in the center, put it on the square watering pattern, and it goes corner to corner in our garden, getting the whole area wet, without watering things we don't want watered outside the area.  AND, with lower water pressure, it just goes less distance.  It's very nice so far.  Also used for more rectangular areas and it does well.  Impressed for the price, so far."
5.0,I bought two several years ago and then recently searched to find them again to give as GIFTS I think so much of them!  Great product for very specific watering and no problems what-so-ever.
5.0,"This sprinkler does what it says it will.  Covers small to large spaces, and does a good job of reaching the corners."
3.0,"I have been using this for a year for spot watering dry places in my yard.  It's especially useful for small areas and it is much better than the Nelson equivalent which has serious uniformity problems.

The only issue with this one seems to be that it starts to leak profusely after a while because the internal water connection becomes loose.  It can easily be repaired as follows:

1.  Remove the single screw from the bottom and lift off the rotating top.

2.  Pull out the round water transfer fitting on the base (identifiable by the small rubber O-ring).

3.  Remove the metal spring washer, which has probably become flattened out over time.

4.  Bend the spring washer into a more warped shape.  It's best to bend it in thirds rather than in half.

5.  Put spring washer back on and reassemble the way it came apart.

I intend to get another one of these for my other hose.  Very handy."
1.0,Did not measure up... at all! It only waters less than 1/4 of the area it claims to cover. Very disappointing.
5.0,"Although it is plastic (my old one was metal and have more 'heft'), the spray patterns work well."
3.0,"The patterns work well, but the coverage isn't nearly as good as described. Still, it works for smaller areas and I like the different shapes available."
3.0,dispointed in the preformance
5.0,I have a long raised rectangular vegetable garden and needed a sprayer that had a rectangular spray pattern.  It was really difficult to find something like that.  I didn't want to water the grass around the garden as then we have to mow more often and it's a waste of water.  This sprinkler head has a rectangular spray pattern for one of the features and worked as I had hoped it would.
3.0,didn't care for it
5.0,Bought this as a fun time sprinkler. My kids love it and it waters the yard. We live in Florida and used it off and on for 8 month last year. It still works for this year!
4.0,it works good using the different out puts
5.0,Great !!!!!!
5.0,Best sprinkler ever.
4.0,This was a replacement ...
3.0,May be okay for small areas. Quality not what I expected from  Gilmour.
1.0,Poor coverage
4.0,"I have used this sprinkler for the better part of the year to water narrow areas in my yards.  I primarily use the rectangle-shaped setting to water areas that my larger sprinkler misses and/or would use too much water to cover such a small area.  For this purpose it is effective.  While it still works, it does seem a bit flimsy and the water distribution isn't completely uniform, but for around $10 this us a decent little sprinkler as long as you're not trying to cover much square footage, as the range is lacking."
2.0,Works but doesnt cover the space I expected.
3.0,"Pretty flimsy and needs to be anchored or it will flip over easily with minimal water pressure.  The dimensions are incorrect in the listing.
Square 19 x 19 and 26 x 26
Rectangle 16 x 36 and 11 x 43 ( I really needed the 50 ft so I wouldn't have to reposition)
Circle 32
I won't send it back but pretty disappointed"
4.0,Does the job.
2.0,Did not work as expected.
5.0,It works no complaints.
1.0,Too lightweight and seems to spray water everywhere else rather than where I want it to go.
2.0,"These don't work, as you don't get even spread of water around these.  They are hard to move around while running (get you wet) and hard to change.  The idea doesn't work.  Will look for something else."
5.0,"I have had this sprinkler for 4 years and it has been very dependable. I put it a shut off valve on the hose just before it. With the five different patterns, I can water any small area of any shape--square, rectangular, round. I can even water the long narrow flower beds around the house and the patio. The valve lets me control how big the area is without having to go back to where I turn on the hose. I am buying a second one so I can use it in the front."
3.0,"It works.. it just doesn't cover a large area, and isn't what I was hoping it would be. If you only need to water a small area it might be sufficient."
2.0,"Sprinkler is a piece of JUNK. It is NOT weighted and thus does not sit flush on the lawn. Entire sprinkler is not weighted at all and is feather light - just a piece of plastic and nothing more. Again, not weighted at all. Very thin and will break easily. I am using a brick to stabilize it. Cheaply manufactured."
3.0,"haven't used yet, it is very light weight.  Had a metal one a few years ago."
1.0,Did not work. Very hard to hook up and did not cover anywhere near the area it was supposed to. Got a refund and threw it away.
3.0,"This sprinkler is oriented so that the water jets shoot out from left to right from the hose connection.  So if you have a narrow and long garden surrounded by fencing,  as I do,  it will not work unless you feed the hose thru the fence.  If you do not have such a situation, this sprinkler should work just fine. My old sprinkler was oriented top to bottom from the hose connection so I could simply pull the hose into the garden and then pull it along to new areas when one area was soaked.  Can't do this with this particular sprinkler.  I wish they would have explained this limitation in the description."
4.0,"For the price, this is an excellent purchase. The construction is durable enough, just don't step on it. The sprinker patterns cover my front and back lawns nicely."
4.0,"It's a little lightweight, but also very inexpensive.  The patterns are true and it's easy to set up.  I really have no complaints."
5.0,I was looking for a sprinkler for the summer so that my son could enjoy himself in the heat.  After looking at many kids sprinklers I decided to go with this one and I'm glad I did.  This has enough power to push the water high up and spreads far. He has really enjoyed himself I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive sprinkler.
4.0,Works fine.
5.0,"This sprinkler has worked well for us so far, and gets used and moved almost daily. Decent deal in my opinion for ten bucks, though I saw another one in the local feed store for half that price. I can only vouch for this product though, and I would buy this one again. The different spray heads are great, and allow us to use just the one sprinkler for all the different shapes of lawn and garden areas we need to get water to."
5.0,Works well for my yard space. Well made and I love that I am able to select the water flow
1.0,Terrible
3.0,Not the best made item but it's working fr now
4.0,"Exactly as described , perfect for small spaces and floer gardens and the lil kids too"
5.0,Great sprinkler that I can choose several different settings on. I like it much better than my other sprinkler that only has the one setting that goes from one side to the other. This seems to get the job done faster thus letting me go on with my day much quicker.
2.0,Maybe I missed the memo but the range for this is very small.  If I only had a small garden - great.  But I have a good size lawn.  Lots of options for shape of water spouting but still a very small range.
3.0,"So, I was expecting a larger spray area with this unit.  I am definitely not getting the sq feet advertised.  I can still use it in my garden though.

I do not believe my water pressure is the culprit, as I have no issues with water pressure in general.  I have city water and a properly working pressure regulator.

I have a number of other water sprinklers that work as advertised.  This one only gives me a 4' x 4' spread.  Either there is a design issue or mine is defective.  From what I read on numerous reviews, sprinklers are hit and miss.  This one is a miss for me, but still use-able in specific areas of my property."
5.0,as expected
3.0,Product is ok.  It does not move side to side like the other sprinklers.
3.0,Holes are too big so it soaks the lawn very quickly and if you have it in tandem with another sprinkler this will take all the water from the other one.
1.0,"Absolute garbage. Barely any pressure and only covers a tiny area no matter which setting.
I have a small area of my lawn that just needs water all summer. This sprinkler only covered 1/3 of that small area.
I will not be using this for any purpose.
You get what you pay for. What a piece of junk."
5.0,Works great so far
5.0,exactly what I needed at a great price.
5.0,This is great for $8. A little hard twisting the top piece to change sprinkler head.
5.0,I've had this sprinkler for a few years now. Smaller radius but because of this it puts more water where I want it quickly. Performed exactly for what I purchased it for
5.0,DOES THE JOB
3.0,"It is okay. Not very powerful and not wide enough coverage to be effective to water a lawn. It has been fine to spot treat areas of the lawn and for the kids to run through. It is very reasonably price though, so I guess you get what you pay for."
5.0,Works great for my toddler to play in as intended. :)
3.0,"I love the full circular pattern, however, the large rectangle is terrible. It does not spray evenly. So, if you have a square lawn area, this is a great sprinkler, otherwise, just plan on moving it often to get complete coverage."
5.0,I love with multiple setting.
1.0,This sprinkler did not give me any coverage. I would have had to move it all over the yard to water the lawn. Wish I would have gotten something else.
5.0,light duty plastic  but it will never rust  but will last 2-3 tears perfect for low water pressure  7 bucks you can't beat it
1.0,"I just picked up two of these at Lowe's, and I'm returning them. They leak like crazy from the hose intake so the pressure is reduced. I had it set to the 16x36 rectangle and it barely hit a 3x5 area. Crazy."
2.0,"It only covers a very small area. My yard is very big and the first time I used it, it took hours to get it all watered. I had to buy a new sprinkler that covers a wider area. Thankfully it didn't cost a lot since it was replaced after the first use."
3.0,"I bought two of these sprinklers because of the different patterns available for watering.  They aren't quite as flexible as I hoped, however, because when used in a full on circle or square pattern, the square footage of area reached is significantly less.  That said, I use it mostly for watering the gardens alongside the sidewalk and fence lines, so the two vertical lines pattern works great for me.,"
1.0,worthless
3.0,"Eh, it's decent. But it leaks a lot, causing puddles underneath. I recommend the rotary sprinkler instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmour-Light-Duty-Whirling-Rotary-Circular-Sprinkler/dp/B00002N68H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmour Light Duty Whirling Rotary Circular Sprinkler</a>"
4.0,good
2.0,Had to get a refund because the larges pattern should spray 30' by 30' and mine sprayed less than 5' by 5'.  I noticed that other reviews that have a low star rating are saying the same thing.
1.0,Pretty crappy
4.0,Does the job well
4.0,Good basic sprinkler which works well in a number of settings. I especially like the half-circle.
5.0,"GREAT PRODUCT, BUT KEEP PLASTIC MATERIAL FROM AGE-HARDENING AND CRACKING !"
5.0,"Best 7.99 I ever spent.  This little gadget works.  After I got soaked on my first use, trying to figure it out, I just left it alone to do its work.  I love it."
5.0,Inexpensive way to water lawn. Puts water exactly where you want it. Five pattern choices.
5.0,As expected
5.0,Love this
5.0,"Works well, and as advertised.  Easy to attach to something sturdy."
5.0,Great product and fast shipping.
4.0,"This is the second one of these I've had in the past 30 years.  Yes, 30 years.  I know I know, I do take care of my stuff.  LOL  Anyway, I just about a year ago I decided to throw it away as looked pretty sun baked.  It still worked but still it was kinda rough looking.

I have had just about every kind of sprinkler on the market and this was my go to sprinkler.  It puts out a good amount of water.  In my case about an inch per hour.  That's the amount that they say one should put down with my type of soil which is sandy Loam.  Yours you'd have to find out what is commented.

The only complaint I have is it does not distribute the water completely uniformly so there are spots that don't seem to get as much as another but when you run it for an hour like I do the ground is pretty damn wet all over the entire area which with my water pressure is about 15 to 18 feet diameter.  I wish it put out a larger area but that's what my impact sprinkler is for - large areas.

Revised 10/16/15 - Wanted to update this comment.  For whatever reason this sprinkler is not putting out the distance it did when brand new.  I took it apart and cleaned both filters and it's now working but I don't get the firm stop positions on the various spray patterns but that really doesn't bother me though so happy again.  Very easy to take it apart to get at the second filter.  One screw on the bottom and that's it."
5.0,works great
5.0,Finally a great adjustable sprinkler. Adjusts easily to change pattern and wide base keeps it flat to ground. orks we'll with grey water system too if cleaned once a week.
2.0,you'll need a lot of water pressure to get this to spray... ours is low and the pattern was about 4 ft wide... lol... really...
3.0,I should have given it a closer inspection.  It only sprays out of one port at a time.
5.0,I have narrow beds and these are perfect
5.0,Right price and excellent results!
5.0,"Ths is absolutely the finest sprinkler head we have every had for our property.  In fact, our neighbor had one, and after using hers, we ordered two for ourselves, at a time when we are needing consistent moisture for a newly re-seeded lawn.  Five sprinkling patterns cover every sprinkling shape and need. We have low water pressure and it works perfectly. Lightweight and easy to set up.  A true Winner!"
2.0,"This product did not perform as expected.  The area of coverage was much less than advertised.  I ordered two of them and both had the same limitations.  It is not clear to me whether the embedded filter screen is impeding flow too much, or whether there is another problem.  It should be noted also that the US distributor of the product, as identified on the packaging, does not provide a means of contacting them for customer support.  An email address listed on their Web site was rejected as undeliverable."
4.0,Nice sprinkler and soaks various patterns well
3.0,"I'm rating this 3-star for quality, or lack thereof. You get what you pay for.
It didn't do the job for me, so I was forced to buy a more expensive sprinkler.
In my estimation, it's worth the ten bucks as a back-up, should my nice sprinkler break down."
2.0,Well made for a plastic spray but spray patterns too wide.  Gets the gardener wet no matter what.
5.0,I've bought a lot of sprinklers. Last one of these melted under the grill. Love this one.
4.0,I've used this sprinkler now for 2 summers and it's quite wonderful.  Makes watering the lawn a much easier task.
3.0,It didn't cover my rectangular area as well as I'd hoped. Perhaps my area was too small. It may work better in an open area.
5.0,Nice product
1.0,"what a worthless piece of junk.  The large square and large circle supposed to cover up to 30 ft.  i""m getting 10 and the pattern is so uneven that it will not do anything in the way of watering."
1.0,Does not cover the advertized areas. My garden is 20ftx 35ft.  This sprinkler would not even water half of the area on any of the settings.  I will be returning this product to the place I purchased it.
5.0,"Hard to find in stores now...  Most are ocillating or center spray, this one has a strip rectangle pattern for flower beds..."
4.0,It is what I was looking for.
3.0,Light weight. Great for the price. I like the different settings.
4.0,World fantastic four the price. I've been using this sprinkler every day for the last 3 month and it's still perfectly fine
5.0,"Perfect for watering a long rectangular grass and flower area in our yard. No significant overspray.

Sturdy
Easy to adjust
Lays flat

Great solution to our problem for very little money!"
3.0,"I bought these on Amazon because Lowes was out of stock in August (nobody buys lawn stuff in August?) and their web site for some bizarre reason declared them ""hazmat"" and couldn't ship them to me.  These last a season or two, but are perfect to just leave in place to water our landscaping patches without having to move stuff around.  Cheap enough to replace once something breaks (usually the plastic pattern caps break off).  Would be nice if you could buy quality sprinklers these days, but at least they are cheap."
5.0,"I bought this as a replacement for one of the other sprinklers that swings from side to side. The problem with those earlier ones is that after 3 years of use, the turning mechanism tends to get jammed and hence, only side of the garden gets watered. With this Gilmour Sprinkler, you get to chose one of five patterns in which you need the water to be sprinkled. Initially, my mistaken impression was that water flows out of all 5 nozzles simultaneously. It actually sprays out of any one of the patterns/ designs at a time. You get to turn the big black dial to select the one pattern of your choice. It really works well for low water pressure connections."
3.0,"Got this item to replace one  for a family member that don't like change.
Found the exact unit to avoid any changes"
4.0,Good product and seems to work well with a variety of coverage types.  Unfortunately not great for large lawns though
5.0,"I love this sprinkler.  This is a great sprinkler, all of the zones work just as described and up the the amount of square feet that the package said.  I can water almost any size of space.  Very easy to just turn down the flow of water to the sprinkler to water the same shape area that may be smaller.  I put 2 of these in line using a 5/8"" line and a 1/2"" line on the second and they work great to water the long strip along side of the house."
2.0,"I don't know what the problem is, but the device seems to restrict the flow of water.  My old sprinkler, while not having the number of patterns,supplies a greater distance of throw."
5.0,"This sprinkler did not put a dent in my wallet, but its quality is very good. Just a nice product that shipped quickly, and does its job, which in my case is to water those few odd shaped spots my system does not get. Easily turn turret to fit shape you need to water."
1.0,"the settings on this sprinkler are horrible. no matter what setting you put it on it want to simply shoot straight up into the air.  I wanted it to water a long strip of flower bed in my yard and it is the worst sprinkler I could have purchased. although it has a setting for what I intended, it still shoots straight up with very little streams of water going out on either side.  I have had one like this before and it worked great. but it was a different brand."
4.0,This sprinkler is very particular about the water pressure coming through the hose.  Too much and it leaks all over; not enough and it doesn't do anything at all.  I like the sprinkler once I figure out how far to turn the faucet on.  It does a great job on my square garden.  The adjustments work great for different shapes.  Using the square shape does not cause any overspray in my garden.  It is very lightweight which is nice but concerning.  Lightweight sprinklers have not lasted long historically for me.  I have only had this for a few weeks but I am happy with it so far.
1.0,"The o-ring seal at the interface between the base and turret ports, just does not seal, causing the unit to leak there badly - even at less than the 60-psi water-pressure limit. I have had a similar problem with a similar (turret) design from a different manufacturer."
1.0,"First off, it requires a high amount of water pressure. Originally, I thought that each head works at the same time. That is why I ordered it. However, you can only work one head at a time, and the options are sub-par. It's cheap, but I am returning this product and buying another Noodlehead N111C Flexible Lawn & Garden Sprinkler. It works fart better and is very adjustable."
4.0,"This is my second purchase. After trying this sprinkler, I trashed all the rest! MUCH easier to change the spray pattern than change sprinklers when you move it around the yard."
4.0,"I have a relatively narrow and long patch of grass in front of the house and unless I would stand there and water by hand, lots of water would get wasted by using regular, circular sprinklers.
I found this in Lowes by accident about three years ago and have been using it ever since.

There are several settings available, all of them rectangular format... even though (as other reviewers pointed out) it does NOT cover the area completely evenly and does have tendency to pool the water right around the unit, it still takes lot less time for me to just go and move it around rather than stand there and water by hand...  plus any wasted water gets reduced to a minimum.

Yes, it is cheaply made and it is plastic, but for less then $10 it was a great deal and after three years of regular use it's still going strong."
5.0,"I have used this product for years, and I'm thrilled that it is still available. Perfect pattern; waters close to the sprinkler...no dry area."
5.0,This ia a great product at a great price. If I had a bigger yard I would buy more of them.
5.0,This works great for our yard with it's many patterns. Good quality product. Have had many Gilmore products and always happy.
2.0,"My brother's front yard has all Rain Bird pop-up sprinklers installed.  Sizes range from 6"" to 4"".  This was a brand new house.  During the past 2 years, I had to replace 5 of them.  One failure was due to a defective/broken tip, understandable.  But the other 4 were all failure caused by what appears to be fractures along the top cap.  Upon further investigation, I think the failure is due to design/quality failure:
1.  The cap acts as 2x duty by sealing the top of the sprinkler and also under constant stress by the spring inside.
2.  Every time it is activated, the spring exerts even more stress on the cap as the water pressure compresses the spring against it to allow the sprayer to pop up.
3.  The spring used is a bit too long/strong IMO.  Further causing more pressure on the cap.  Other brand's spring is not as strong/long.

As a result, failure is frequent.  Initially, I thought the problem was defective caps.  But after 4 failures, I think it is failure by design.  Sure, it is relatively cheap to replace.  One can either buy in bulk from Rain Bird a pack of caps for about $2 each + shipping.  Or by from HomeDepot with for $2 each with tubes and spring (3""), no sprayer tip.  But this is very annoying.  For such a simple mechanical device, it should not be this brittle.  Even if it is made of plastic.

I have since replaced one of them with Orbit brand 6"" sprinkler.  Its design is different than the Rain Bird.  The cap is not compressed by the spring, and the spring used is not as strong.  Will need to observe to see if it is more durable than the Rain Bird.

Update:  After years of use, I am happy to report that the Orbit brand sprinker is superior and has not broken down once.  So I highly recommend you to replace the Rainbirds when you notice issues."
5.0,It is a good product
5.0,"Simple to install and set up the spray angle and range, and it works just like the specs and product info say it should.  I found the side port particularly useful as I was replacing 4"" pop-ups and this allowed me to use the same elbow fitting and tube without having to reset the depth - I just turned the elbow 90 degrees."
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"First of all, don't look at the packaging..After all, ""you can put lipstick on a pig and its still a pig"". Lol
All joking aside, BOTH the Rain Bird brand and the vender who filled my order are #1 in my professional opinion. I ONLY trust & use Rain Bird sprinklers for both myself and my clients..Again, if the ""Wheel aint broke, no need to fix it"". With 20 plus years in Residential Home Building/Remodelling and Irrigation System design and installation , Rain Bird sprinklers  NEVER  failed. My order was ""filled"" by a factory authorized dealer so I know both the quality of the product and professionalism of the vendoe are there."
5.0,Great nozzles at a great price.
5.0,Just what I needed that no one carried locally. Arrived within a few days. Thanks!
5.0,Bought one of these as a replacement for a broken sprinkler. I am completely happy with this sprinkler. I only use it as a 360 degree spay pattern. It cover ten feet in distance for my particular lawn. Easy to install. All you have to do is unscrew the old head and screw in the new. Make sure the riser is still attached. Test the spray pattern before setting you sprinklers automatically. You want to ensure no leaks are present. I will definitely buy more of these when i need them.
3.0,ok
5.0,arrived on time and works good
5.0,Very good sprinkler head. It works smoothly and does a great job spraying the water to cover s large area.
5.0,Love Them
5.0,Nice product.  Fit my needs as a replacement to a current sprinkler head that was damaged.
5.0,Great replacement works great
5.0,made upgrading my sprinkler system a breeze
5.0,Work great...easy to use
5.0,Arrived several days early. Works great. Thanks
5.0,Works well.
1.0,I'm not sure what happened with this. We installed it and then we had to replace it after 2 runs because water was shooting everywhere like the head was run over...but the thing is...this head was not in the path of anything to run it over and crack it.
5.0,These sprinkler heads save you a lot of watering. I can turn on my system and run it for 5 minutes and not get the same results with my hose in much more time. I put this together with a splitter on my hose outlet on the house and some rainbird tubing. My lawn looks pristine and with minimal work. Digging these in only requires a little work with minimal dirt removal. Anyone can do it with ease. Prior to installing this I had the saddest lawn on the block but now it's the best!
5.0,Works as expected. I have my own lawn irrigation system and all the longer distance are made by this company. I would recommend any of them.
5.0,Works great and shipped very fast.
4.0,Very good product
5.0,Delivered as promised and is working great!
4.0,This product works just as advertised. You can  spray as little or as large of a lot as you'd like. Sprays a 10 foot small lawn perfectly for me.
5.0,"I install sprinklers for a living, you can't go wrong with Rainbird in general. They make a part for just about anything you could need and parts are readily available. Just stay away from the Rainbird Sure Pop cheaper model or other cheap brands.

The Rain Bird 1804 Pro is the standard all others are judged by. They are durable, they don't leak or break like the cheaper Rainbird Sure Pop cheaper model and are also better than the look-a-like Orbit head. The RB1802, 2 inch model, actually costs more because they sell fewer of them. Stick with the 4in for most needs and skip the 2in. The only reason to consider a 2in pop up head is if your pipe was installed too shallow but you would be better off using swing pipe or elbows to fit a 4 inch tall head. If by chance your lawn gets very long you'll need the 4in for proper water coverage.

The VAN nozzle means Variable Arc Nozzle (adjustable circle 0 deg to 360 deg) for corners, half sprays, or full circle, or anywhere in between. The best part is you can shut them off completely if needed."
5.0,I have purchased four of these lately and have used three.  They are working very well and I have no complaints at all.  Easy to install and adjust.
5.0,"Durable and strong, good sprinkler"
5.0,Exactly what I ordered.  Works great
5.0,Excellent sprinkler - lasts a while - Altough it's tough the adjust to the 90 or 180 degrees.  Get ready to be soaked.
5.0,"fast delivery, worked great for my project"
5.0,Did not install yet.  My son tried it out with the garden hose and had a ball.
5.0,Easy to install and works great.
5.0,Rain Bird's standard high quality.
5.0,Best Sprinkler system
5.0,"As the landscape grows the 4"" pop ups I had just weren't getting the water where it needed to go. Switching the 6"" fixed that. Installation was easy as I was just replacing, so unscrew one and screw this one in. Will be ordering more to replace some other 4"" ones I have."
4.0,Work well this year.
5.0,"Great sprinkler Pop-Up! I needed ones that were quality and not junk. I bought a lot of these and I'm very satisfied. I also really like the fact I can easily adjust the coverage area. It saved me from having to buy various sprinkler heads. I use them with Augustine grass that I cut at 4"" in height, so these allow the sprinkler head to rise a couple of inches out of the grass, and the watering is excellent. I also used them with Flex Lines from Amazon. The combination  for me is absolutely perfect."
5.0,I have found Rain Bird products to be consistently well made and they perform well over many years in service.
5.0,Very reasonably price and with prime arrive in a couple of days.  They work well and last a long time.  No complaints and useful for watering your lawn.
1.0,not a dual spray
5.0,Easy install using the side opening and a flexible riser. Handles the job well!
5.0,"Great sprinkler, replaced a broken head in my yard with this, working exactly as expected."
5.0,Perfect for replacement
4.0,"These work well.  I installed them where I needed an extra inch of height from leveling out some land in my yard.  i previously had some 4 inch Rainbird's that were probably around 3 years old.  I installed these fairly fast, and the spray is strong and covers the grass well.  I only took one star off because you can't get the spray down to 8 feet.  It's about 10 feet at the lowest setting."
4.0,"This is  a great product solve watering problems for a troublesome area. My only complaint is that I had to buy a special 1/2 inch male to male coupler to attach it to an existing 1/2 inch water line.  However, I like the product some much, I bought 5 more pop-ups and went out of my to the hardware store to buy 5 more couplers."
1.0,"NO, these are NOT Dual Spray, they only have upper spray pattern, not dual. Yes they are adjustable angle, but not dual spray (upper and lower)."
5.0,Good pop-up head. Works fine.
4.0,Great replacement. Be sure to order the spray nosel insert or use the old one.
5.0,It was the perfect for my garden with high scrubs.
5.0,Thank you.
5.0,"Just what I expected, easy installation and perfect performance"
5.0,Excellent replacement
5.0,better than the original ones. inexpensive easy to install and set up
5.0,"I used these with 12"" risers and old sprinkler bases and 2 almost water my entire yard."
5.0,Great deal
4.0,"These function well. And the price was great compared to what the landscapers wanted to change to replace a bunch of these. They were very each to install if you are replacing older or broker heads.
My biggest complaint is the sticker that you see in the picture. That is stuck on and on some of the ones I bought the sticker would not come off. So I just installed it figuring it is outside and with the rain and such it would wear of quickly. It has been over 6 months and some of them still have the ugly half york off sticker on them in my flower beds."
5.0,Works great.
4.0,Good
5.0,Great replacement part for existing system.
4.0,Cant go wrong with rain bird! Best brand out there and will last under all conditions.
5.0,Came fast and just right
5.0,If you are a do it yourself person this will save you a lot of money from having to call out a repair man to fix your sprinkler system. Great product works as advertised and easy to install. It basically screws on but you have to dig up the ground to get to the old one
5.0,Order met or exceeded all expectations.
5.0,I highly recommend this product and seller! Great product & amazing service!!!
4.0,"Rain Bird does a great job with these sprinklers.  Our gardens were much more lush than past years due to quality watering practices with these.  Very easy to install, although I have the benefit of a bit of experience in landscaping."
4.0,Good value.
5.0,"Seems OK, haven't installed yet"
5.0,Easy to adjust
4.0,"Purchased a pack of these Rain Bird 1804 sprinkler heads to increased the coverage area of a system I was preparing to install. So far that have worked like a charm. As stated by another reviewer, adjust the ""throw"" distance by turning the collar.

The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is the fact that I can't seem to get the total coverage area up to the 15 feet maximum claimed by the manufacturer. In reality it's more like 10-12 feet of coverage."
5.0,great price!  Perfect.
5.0,"I got this as a replacement for one I ran over and broke. We have several different types of sprinklers, but they're all Rain Bird. Most of our sprinklers have been operating for years without any problem. I'll probably stay with this brand as long as I have sprinklers."
5.0,Works perfectly as we needed a higher spray of water after building a stone area around plants.
5.0,Great buy to replace my broken one. Fast ship.
5.0,"Bought two, installed one and it works great, good reach and doesn't waste water around the unit"
5.0,factory original replacement for the sprinkler head that my lawn guys keep runnung over.
5.0,this shoots far and sprays out so i bought this to add to a riser and it is working well
5.0,"RainBird irrigation systems are great.  Easy to install, adjust, and maintain.  I worked as a landscaper several years ago and learned how easy it was to install irrigation.  Now I have sprinklers in my flower beds and the gardens looks great!"
5.0,Best sprinkler I've used in very tough situation.  Provides up close coverage in places where I can't have one sprinkler spray on to the base of the next.  I've been able to reduce number of sprinklers by 1/4.
5.0,I have had excellent results with this product.
5.0,factory replacement for my sprinkler head.  Popped right in.
1.0,Do not adjust very well at all. Very disappointed
5.0,Just got a few of these to set up a watering system for the garden.  They were easy to install and adjust.  Ordering more now for the yard.
1.0,A very well made product which can be adjusted to quarter/half or full spray.  A very useful thing for my lawns where I used to always have an uncovered/dry patch.
2.0,Pretty good sprinkler. To be completely honest my local Home Depot has them for about the half the price. The difference being Home Depot has the 1800 series with dual spray. Much better than these single spray heads. I assumed that these were dual spray heads. My mistake. My review only reflects my distaste with the value
2.0,"I have tried a few different Rain Bird heads, and all of them sprayed a fine mist high up in the air to get an uniform spray that remind me more of a mister than a sprinkler. The problem is that half the water evaporate or get blown away in when there is a light wind.

I got rid of them ASAP and gone back to Hunter heads where it is a spray and not a mist."

5.0,Worked great as a replacement for our existing sprinklers. First tried to replace with non PRS from a local ACE hardware store and it popped up and shot me in the chest while adjusting the nozzle; that prompt me to just get these and they rock!
5.0,I like these. Some other mfg'rs have incomprehensible setup instructions but could actually figure these out. Plus I really like the color choices.
5.0,"Worked great.  I would order this again or recommend to anyone.
Product was deli vered on time and installation was easy."
5.0,"These are the real-deal.  These are made quite strong and the adjustments are great feature.  Easy to install, not counting the digging."
5.0,I couldn't get this at the local Home Depot because they were out of stock so I let my fingers do the shopping.
5.0,"Haven't installed any of these yet, they were purchased to keep spares on hand. They are Rainbird so my past experience tells me that these should function just fine."
5.0,These rainbirds  are top quality sprinklers that work without a hitch. They have adjustable pattern and are easy to adjust.
1.0,Cheap;odd size that doesn't match any other sprinkler tube tip. It broke immediately! No wonder it was so darn cheap.
5.0,"The best sprinkling heads available in the market.
Has 2 points to attach the water hose.
Fully adjustable and sturdy by design."
3.0,"So far so good. I attached this product to my sprinkling system, and I did not have any issue with it so far. It works good, covers the designated zone, enough water and easy to adjust."
2.0,"After installing the watering system, I turned-on the water, and it did not take more than two times to break. The replacement is still working fine. I was like to buy some extra pieces for something like that....!"
4.0,"I replaced some existing Rand Bird 4inch popups with these. They deliver the additional height over the 4inch that I removed. Installation of these of a bit easier due to two choices of water inlet; 1/2 port on the button or the 1/2 port half way up the casing. The nozzle which comes with this sprinkler allows with 360 degree spray or it can be adjusted down along with a 20% reduction of water coming out of the nozzle to reduce the maximum spray diameter.

I reduced my rating from 5 to 4 stars for this body (without nozzle) can be purchased for under $5. Nozzles generally run between $1 and $1.50 which makes this sprinkler to be not so good of a value at its current price.

Also keep in mind that this sprinkler is Rain Bird's cheapest line of sprinklers. More expensive models may come with pressure regulators to ensure a more consistent spray pattern if your water pressure changes or improved seals which reduce water leakage after retracting back into the ground.

So my recommendation to anyone considering buying is that if you are replacing an existing Rain Bird sprinkler and want to save a few dollars by using the nozzle from your old sprinkler, just buy the body and save a few dollars. Saving a few dollars per sprinkler is a big deal when you are like me and have approximately 20 4inch popups you need to replace with 6inch."
1.0,"The replacement head I received appears to be a newer model than the one advertised here.

Gone is the old rotating adjuster to set the right-hand limit of the watering area, replaced with a cheap plastic cap with a horseshoe shaped slit in it. Appears to water anywhere between 180 and 180 degrees. Hope you like 180.

Around the top of the head is now a pull-ring similar to a juice bottle or some milk cartons, it should NOT be removed. If you remove it, the inner wand will retract completely into the housing and will not pop up at the next watering, water will just shoot 10 feet into the air unhindered.*

Everything about this new head feels thinner, flimsier, and cheaper than the ones I've been replacing for the last 10 years. Price is the same though.

*I discovered that the new housing is about 2"" shorter than the old one, so if you choose to dig the old one up out of the ground instead of just replacing the head, it does not appear to over-retract. If I'm going to have to dig it up, I'll just get a replacement from one of the other half-dozen sprinkler manufacturers."
5.0,Rainbird equipment is always good.  Everyone knows that.  I'm so glad I installed a new one.  The old one was.... old.
5.0,"It is very easy to replace the sprinkler heads which I just did in a matter of a few minutes. There is one issue and I want to point that out first. The unit is covered with a glued on paper tag that explains all about he sprinkler head. It absolutely will not remove easily. It took me 15 minutes to get the paper label off the two heads that i purchased. I eventually had to heat the label with a hair dryer and even then they would not remove easily. This is just a nagging point with me as no label should be that hard to remove. You may be asking why did I want to remove the labels. Well in my case the two spray head were about 12 inches above ground in my flower beds and I really did not care for all the advertising of Rainbird in my front yard. In my case all I had to do was unscrew the heads fro the 12 inch extender pipe and then screw the new heads back on. Be sure and check the radius area on the old sprinkler head so you can get the exact duplicate. This is a very easy job. Be care not to unscrew the riser pipe other wide you stand the chance of getting some soil or sand in your water line. In the event you dod not have a rise pole and the sprinkler head is screwed directly into your sprinkler water line, it is still an easy job. Just remover the dirt or sand around the area where the headed is connected to the pipe and one again be careful not to let dirt or sand get into your water line, then just screw the new replacement head back into the water supply line. You have just saved yourself a$50 to $100 service call. I you want to do a professional job, put a small amount of teflon tape around the threads before you screw the head into the pipe. Now you are a professional sprinkler head replacement persons."
5.0,"Because it  work great
If it work I will like it
I will recommend to my friends and my family"
5.0,The quality looks good. Installation is easy although it's a little bit difficult to dig deep to get the broken one out.
5.0,"I ran over one of my Rain Bird heads while it was up, so obviously broke it.  Didn't feel like calling a ""professional"" to charge approx $100, give or take....so, watched a short YouTube video, grabbed my shovel when this little head arrived, and Voila!  Less than $5 and a perfect replacement...and yes, I'm a woman. Says it's adjustable circle, but I haven't gone out to change it, yet, so still getting the full circle."
5.0,Bought a 12 year old home and had to replace numerous heads due to simply being worn out.  Bought the 1804VAN as well as 5304s and am extremely pleased with the products.
5.0,"My wife ran over this sprinkler head with the lawn mower and shattered it completely. I first thought to call the repair company as this seemed like a complicated job. But somebody told me it was a simple screw it off screw it on job. You know like changing a light bulb. So I started to look for a replacement part. I tried Lowes, Home Depot, Ace, no luck. Then I saw it on Amazon. The only thing to know about this is there are two ways to install this sprinkler head. The most common way is the screw on screw off way. The other way, my situation, is to plug the bottom port and use an elbow fitting that friction fits to a plastic hose. Either way you can do it yourself! Just dig up the broken one install it,and twist the spray head in the right direction and you are done. This is a very long sprinkler so you have have to dig down pretty deep but I just used a hand trowel and my hands. If you look at the picture you will see where the elbow fitting goes, just a little down from the top of the sprinkler. The plug is in there and you take it out and put it in the bottom of the unit. I think you have to order the elbow fitting separate if this is the way yours is connected. Anyway I order the part and elbow from Amazon, get it quickly at a fair price, install it myself, and save big. You can too! This is really a very easy repair that almost anyone can do. To close,you might ask how the lawnmower broke this sprinkler as it is used in flower and shrub beds where you do not use a lawnmower. As I said you may ask. Refer to the second word I wrote."
5.0,"I have used these heads for over 15 years and they work just fine. The adjustment screw for the throwing distance is a pain to get to, requiring a small flathead screw driver but once they are set your good to go for several years. Setting the left side of the spay pattern requires a strong grip but again once it is set your good for many years of service. The spray pattern is adjustable to a full 360 degrees which requires fewer repair parts to stock if and when you do have a problem. The heads set flat to the ground which makes for a smoother appearance in the yard. The heads pop up 4 inches which clears the grass nicely and they retract all the way reliably. Once these are setup they are worry free for many years. I have tried other heads, and there is nothing worse than going around the yard knocking down spray heads that refuse to retract when the water shuts off. These heads are very reliable and are very versatile. With a good head to head coverage pattern you will have a beautiful yard using these sprinkler heads."
5.0,"When I read the reviews here (two 1-star reviews) I was concerned so I did some more research and found this instructional video [go to youtube, search for ""Rainbird 1800 Spray Heads""]. If you watch the video, you are NOT supposed to unscrew the top off. Note that the pressure compensating screens will adjust the distance.

I followed the instructions and the spray heads worked for me!  :)"
1.0,"The heads on these ""adjustable"" sprinklers cannot be adjusted.  The metal screw that controls the spray distance is extremely difficult to access.  For some reason, rain bird decided to encase the tiny screw in a plastic cylinder, making it impossible to access with a normal-size flathead screwdriver.  The older non-adjustable rain bird sprinkler heads don't have this limiting feature.  So, the solution is simply to use a smaller screwdriver.  Wrong!  Once you are able to get to the screw, the groove in the head is so shallow and the screw is way too tight that you will end up stripping it.  It simply cannot be turned.  Older rain bird non-adjustable heads have screws with deeper grooves and can actually be rotated.

You may need to rotate the stem a little bit to change the spray direction.  This is difficult to do with bare hands as the stem is hard to turn without also turning the entire sprinkler assembly.  This is because the stem is held in place pretty tightly.  If you are not careful, you can unscrew and loosen the sprinkler assembly.

The easiest thing with these sprinkler heads is adjusting the spray angle.  You simply twist the threaded collar.  This is pointless if you can't adjust the spray distance.  I had the spray angle where I wanted it, but the spray distance was so far that I was also watering my front door.

Long story short, the 1800 series adjustable sprinkler heads are completely unusable.  Rain Bird needs to recall them and redesign them.  These should be taken off store shelves immediately."
3.0,This is  a read-the-fine print thing.  My fault.  These were tiny
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, the shipment arrived promptly, and it was a good value.  What more can you ask for!"
5.0,"As described, works great."
5.0,Perfect
4.0,"nice points, very few knots in my bunch.

A little soft (pine) but with care I've pounded them into fairly hard ground.

Probably won't last in the weather very long because their are pine, but for the price pretty decent.

I ordered a second bundle."
5.0,"Welp, I couldn't find these in home depot.  Why?  I don't know.  I bought them on AMZ for less $$ anyhow.  They are exactly what I expected"
5.0,I was looking for wooden stakes to create a pinterest craft project. These are perfect - the right size and certainly the right price. Very pleased.
5.0,These are decent stakes. I used em to hold concrete forms in place and they worked as expected. Nice product for a box of pointed wood.
5.0,"Great little wood steaks just the size I needed for a cabinet project I am doing.  I live pretty far off the beaten path and these definitely saved me having to make a trip to Lowes and then rip a board. Also, arrived next day.  Love it."
3.0,"They were hard to nail onto my signs, as they were very solid wood.  I personally thought they would be longer, but that is my mistake for underestimating their length. They were easy to pound into the ground.  The product itself is good for the right project.  I think it was just the wrong product for what I needed, and that was to hold up yard signs."
5.0,"Yes, the stakes aren't perfectly cut, but they went into the soil just fine. I wrapped reflective tape around the square end and marked off come trails that I needed to see in the dark, and they've worked great. Good, sturdy stakes."
5.0,Worked perfectly for our landscaping project!
5.0,Item was sent quickly.  They were exactly what I needed for my project.
4.0,Uniform cuts and good quality wood.
5.0,These work perfect for any garden. I have a harder ground and they were still good and strong. A+++++++
5.0,Fast delivery; exactly as pictured and advertised. Pounded the heck out of a couple of them to stake down a garden border. Held up well! Saved me a trip to Home Depot.
5.0,Good wood.  These are impressive. They are tough and feel solid. Used a rubber mallet to drive into the ground.
5.0,Perfect for my field day use.
3.0,Got the job done but the cuts aren't great.  Not very uniform.
3.0,"For my purposes, which including using these as legs on a home made garden trellis, these worked very well for the task at hand.

However, I found that they were poorly cut. They points weren't even and the point wasn't centered. I'm not sure if this would impact usage, but I found these to be cut very roughly overall and required careful handling to avoid splinters.

They did the job, but the quality wasn't worthy of more than 3 stars."
1.0,"Returned:  These are not the nicely cut and shaped product pictured.  The wood is nasty, splintery and full of knotholes.  The cuts are uneven, poorly shaped, and splintered.  I was going to paint them with chalkboard paint for nice, reusable garden plant stakes (as a gift.)  Totally unsuitable for this, which meant I had to find a substitute fast. Because of the poor cuts and the splintering, I would not have kept them even for purely utilitarian use."
5.0,Very sturdy stakes. All in excellent condition. I bought this size and the 18 inch and the price was terrific!
5.0,just what I ordered/needed
5.0,"Quality steaks, no splinters fairly smooth"
5.0,They work!
5.0,Thanks
4.0,"I didn't pay attention to the thickness, so my fault entirely. These are quite thick, and would work great for tent stakes, line stakes, anything which needed a good bit of solid construction. I however am seeking stakes for actual marking of plants (to paint), having found NO marked which is nearly as durable (and readable after years) as a plain fashioned painted wooden one!."
2.0,"The wood was cut with a lot of nuts, and the stakes shattered a lot. Not I was using them in cold weather."
5.0,Got the job done!
5.0,Great price!!! Have never strung my own thought this is the time!!! Have a great day  and bless you much!
5.0,Its better than buying separate coils with trimmer line. This gives more control on how the line is set on the coil preventing excessive expense of it.
5.0,tough line that can be wound easily around the spool. No problems with breakage or tangles. It stores easily too.
5.0,"the weed eater string arrived as promised and was exactly what I need to get the job done , agreat product@ a terrific price,would definately recommend this seller and would buy from them again."
4.0,Managed to restring the old weed whacker and now it is operational again....good trimmer line.  Was easier than going to the local hardware store to find it.
5.0,The weed eater string is exactly as advertised and packaging was in a bubble envelope.  No problems and I expect it to perform well.
5.0,I have a weedeater that is about 20 years old & never thought I would be able to find replacement spools for it.  I was happy when I found this company. thank you!
5.0,"got product on time in good shape,  used it once no issues and it was cheaper than home depot.  The product seems on par with with the previous string i was using"
5.0,"I use this string with my STIHL trimmer, and everything works perfectly. I have no complaints, and this is a great deal."
5.0,"This stuff is really tough. I have used my weed eater 3 times with the same 4"" strand, and it is still in tact enough to do it again! This 80 foot will last you all year long, and maybe a few years if you don't weed eat much!"
5.0,Great product. Thank you.
5.0,Works well toughest and longest lasting string I have ever used.
5.0,Excellent product
5.0,"good product, can't beat price."
5.0,I have a weed eater trimer. This is the line I use.
4.0,Have not actually used it yet but it looks good and right diameter for my weed eater.
5.0,Repair Clinic and E-Replacement Parts have parts. E Replacement Parts has exploded views of equipment. Amazon has parts in bulk. Stens has a FULL-LINE catalog for 2 and 4 cycle equipment. It is a VERY good catalog! Check Amazon for availability.
5.0,Great price for trimmer line.
5.0,What's to say it's weed eater cord.
5.0,Line works well and I didn't have to go and get it.
4.0,This is a colorful piece of nylon. Weeds beware.
5.0,Good quality line. A good replacement for the original line in my trimmer.
5.0,"Great product, Fair pricing."
5.0,100% good
5.0,good
4.0,"Arrived promptly as promised. Product is exactly as described. The packaging is good as the string is easy to get off of the spool but it doesn't come unwrapped by itself as others do. They even put a couple of small holes at the top of the spool that you can thread the bitter end through. This ensures it won't unwind and it's easy to find the end. The line stands up to my yard as well as any other I've used.  Good product, good seller."
4.0,"TYhis si good string, works fine, just a little brittle.  Possibly old new stock, but still very good for the price.  super fast shipping!"
5.0,fit right on my robin string trimmer  !
5.0,"Holds up well, easy to apply. Cheap when you buy it from amazon. Have bought it multiple times now, both for me and my parents."
5.0,"Great product, I was under the impression that all lines are the same, but this stuff seems to hold together better than the last line I purchased.  I will buy this line again, but in a larger spool."
5.0,"Hard to find trimmer string (Walmart abandoned and moved on to newer model).  Great and speedy service/delivery.  Great price, too."
2.0,i was looking for a nice pre wound spool for my weed whacker to save time but when i put in the spool it jamed in the first 5 min of whacking and had to re wind the whole spool to get it to un jam
5.0,"The item arrived just as I expected in a timely manner.  I was kept informed of the delivery date. The part fit and works well, as I expected it to do."
5.0,"I have been re-wrapping line on my original spool for over a year. While it worked for a while, the line started breaking on the spool, so I would constantly have to stop, take the spool off, find the end, rethread it, and put the spool back on. I just about threw out the weedeater. These spools work great, just like the orig, so my weedeater is saved."
5.0,I looked everywhere for this product. The stores were out and did not plan to order new stock since it was the end of summer sales. Well in Texas summer can run all the way into December. I needed the string. Amazon had it and it shipped fast. I bought three spools and the cost was the same or less than what I would have paid in the store. Free shipping too.
5.0,Cheapest place to get it is on Amazon. Its the original spool with line that came with your WeedEater Featherlite that uses the small line with 1 line out of the spool.
5.0,This weed eater string replacement was soooo much more durable than the string that came with the machine. Well worth a replacement!
5.0,We went numerous places looking for this particular string for the trimmer.  We couldn't find it anywhere.  So we were pleased to find it through Amazon.  It arrived quickly and was exactly what we needed.  We are very pleased.
4.0,"Thanks for a great product, pre-spooled. It saves a lot of headaches that's for sure. A great idea!"
5.0,This was the right size and a perfect fit for my weedeater. Delivered on time too. Thanks!!
5.0,"Just what my husband needed. Thank you
Joan"
4.0,Item as advertised...
5.0,Thank You
5.0,works like string trimmer
5.0,Supports my FL21 Weedeater as well.  Great price.
5.0,There is nothing that can be said about weed eater brand other than it fits and works. Delivered as advertised and at a good price.
3.0,"Correct item for the popular Featherweight series Weed Eater FL-20 and similar. The spool eventually does wear out from tapping on the ground, and this affordable replacement keeps it going. If the line could just be a little more durable!"
5.0,Plug n play!
5.0,worked fine
1.0,It did not fit the trimmer I bought it for.  I would like a more complete description of sizes you can use it for.
5.0,"Fast delivery and fits perfect , Thanks !! AAAA++++"
5.0,"i just bought a used fl20 from my local swap meet for $7 (yes seven dollars) that runs really good, but was missing the spool. i found this replacement spool on amazon and couldn't be happier."
5.0,This product really cuts a rug. The trimmer is good to go for another 5 years. I recommend this product.
2.0,The line gets wrapped up too tight to feed properly.  It requires frequent stops to unwind and rewinds in order to finish a 15 minute trimming job.  Very frustrating.
5.0,I could not find these local and did not want to attempt to wind my own spool so I bought this. I picked up 2 so I'd have an extra one. Got here quick. Fit inside my EL9 perfect. I did a quick test and this trimmer line was better than the original line the machine came with. Looking forward to putting it to work this weekend!
5.0,I purchased this spool as a replacement for a lost one. Could not find this item in our little town. Works just fine on the little trimmer.
5.0,"Item works great with this Weed Eater trimmer model.

Had no problems loading or using this product.

Highly recommend using this product."
5.0,So happy to find this.  I guess the Featherlite weedeater is becoming obsolete!  No where was carrying the line for it anymore.  So happy I found it on here.
5.0,"Finding this was such a great moment.  I spent several hours and traveling to more than one store a few years ago to get this product.  At that time I purchased several of them.  This year we ran out and I was devastated.  Thank you Amazon, you saved me from hours of frustration."
5.0,excellent shipping product renewed unit operation...slighlty different than original unit but seems to be an improvement...would advise to purchase unit
5.0,"Third one I have purchased and not the last, I'm sure. As long as that trimmer is still working, I'll be back here for replacements."
5.0,Ran out of string on my Weed Eater FL21 and needed a replacement spool.  This popped right on.  Works just like the original.
5.0,great so you don't have to wind the silly thing yourself never works always gets stuck when you do it yourself.
5.0,"Old spool flew off and wouldn't go back on.  Thought I might have to get a new trimmer, but this new spool put it right back in action!"
5.0,I'm glad I found this.  The spool and line for my trimmer are hard to find nowadays so I stocked up.  It slipped right on and weeks are getting whacked.
5.0,"Works fine. In a country well governed,poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed,wealth is something to be ashamed of. Confucius"
5.0,"We could not find this product anywhere locally and were delighted when we found it on Amazon.  It shipped quickly, the price was right and the weed whacker was back doing its job quickly."
5.0,"As with the other review, this is a good product to buy. It beats rolloing your own twine on the spool and f you use it a starting speed, the twine lasts much longer than at higher speeds..."
5.0,This is exactly as stated.my weed eater is smiling again.the replacement spool fit perfectly and works great.thanks for the quick ship.
5.0,"Did not use this for actual purpose, instead used it as a nib for my Wacom tablet pen. Works amazing!"
5.0,great bargain
5.0,Was delivered on time and is as described.
5.0,"this is a great order and easy to use.
 & the S&H is fast . I enjoy using it. thanks"
5.0,"One simply cannot beat the quality of name-brand Weedeater products.  I've tried to save money on lesser products, and basically threw that money away because the string would break easily and 2 spools equaled 1 Weedeater."
5.0,"I do a lot of weedeating for myself and my older relatives.  Lately, it seems my local hardware stores and Walmarts are always running low on this trimmer line.  I was very pleased to be able to order several spools at once, and the price was extremely competitive.  Also, the delivery time was excellent.  All in all, this was a super deal for me."
1.0,"I really can't advise anyone to buy this product.  Literally in the first minute of use after I installed it, I had to unscrew the spool and hand-feed the line at least 6 times.  It broke over and over again, I got about 10 feet of my border done.  I was only cutting grass I can't imagine that this line will hold up on weeds.  If you are looking for .065 line, look elsewhere you will only be as frustrated as I am right now."
5.0,Works great. Love how easy it is to dispense.
1.0,It is a mindless task but needed and better than paying for the pre-loaded spools.
4.0,Good string
5.0,This works great for refilling out Black and Decker cordless trimmer spools.  If your tired of paying $8 for replacement spools you can simply fill your own.  The quality of the line is much higher too.
3.0,"Pretty cheap line, breaks on my metal fence pretty often. But i can't complain about the price. Overall, I think it is worth the price even though it doesn't last super long."
4.0,This is probably a great product for weed eating but I bought this to make nibs for my Intros Pro Large.  This particular product will not work for this.
4.0,This is what I needed.
4.0,good deal and price
5.0,Good weed eater replacement line.
4.0,Great if you know how to thread the spools.
2.0,"I've generally been satisfied with Rain Bird products but was not happy with this drain valve.  Others I have purchased in the past provide some sort of screen on the inlet side to prevent debris from getting into the valve itself and interfering with operation.  On this one the inlet has no protection, you can stick your finger in it and touch the rubber seal (see photo comparing inlet to 2 other drain valves).

The threaded portion is shorter than a typical 1/2"" pipe thread.  Compare to the old green drain valve at the left of the photo which has a full thread.  On one of my fittings there was a slow leak around the joint.  Attempting to tighten further with channel locks caused the head to snap off and it was difficult to extract the threaded portion stuck in the fitting.  I have tightened other drain valves with a wrench and this never happened.  For this one probably best to hand tighten only.

This drain valve might be fine for installations where you don't need a really tight seal and it can be easily replaced if debris gets into it.  But otherwise I would recommend going with a different drain valve.  I definitely would not use this one for buried applications."
5.0,"Before this, the water sat in the pipes, getting hot all day, but with this, at the end of the pressure cycle, water drains out nicely. I think the plants would agree they would rather have a cold shower than a hot one, so its plant friendly."
5.0,does the job as expected. Maybe put a few in your sprinkler line. Just one might be asking for trouble if you don't winterize. Great price on amazon. Cheaper than rainbird and other stores.
5.0,"Seems to do what it says it does....  Guess, I'll know for sure after this winter....  I do like the construction better than the green ones like it at Lowes...."
5.0,"Have been using this product for 4 years now.  Works as advertised.  Must be located at the lowest point in the zone where it is located.  The ""pit"" where located should be filled with gravel or something that will not let the dirt clog this product."
5.0,I have used this pump/filtration system for three years now and it still works great.  I use it 24/7/365 and it does a great overall job. There are several diffeent heads which works particularly well in winter as well.  I was concened about how it will work in the very cold weather as well as ice and snow storms and it is absolutely not an issue.  I recommend a circular heater which fits right over the fountain in winter.  The important thing to remember is to keep cleaning the filters in the algae season and you should have no problems.  I have a preformed plastic liner for my pond which is only 200 gallons but I recommend the 325GPH pump to keep an active water flow.  Overall I am very satisfied with this product.  The only thing I have done is replace the filters.  I have koi as well as goldfish and my success rate/survival rate has been fine.
5.0,"After reading every positive and negative review I could find on this pool, my husband and I decided to give this pool a try.  We went over all the complaints, from treating the pool, putting a cover on the pool, and the most important thing is making sure the ground is level. So I will pass on a few tips that can help you the future pool buyer be aware of. The first thing that is the hardest part and can be a bit of a pain. You should measure out the diameter of pool and go around placing a level on a brick (or something that won't be warped) work your way through out the  circle and check to see how level your ground is. If you need to put down sand or something to make the ground as level as possible I would do it. It took my husband 2 hrs to get this done. Next we laid out a ground cover, we were really not sure if we needed this or not.  Then came the pool, and using a small air compressor (not a bike pump like the video shows) it took 45 min. to completely fill the ring. You must fill ring to the point where there are no more wrinkles in it. Then we did as the video says, to remove wrinkles in the bottom of pool. With 2in of water in the pool, my husband started from the center on hands and knees pushing wrinkles to the outer edges. Then filled the pool the rest of the way, and put the cover on it when we were done. The next day we had a bad rainstorm, and when it cleared up there were leaves and dirt all over the cover. After pulling the cover back finding a clean pool, that was a plus. We found a couple of pluses to the ground cover. If you put a bucket of water next to the ladder you can wash dirt off your feet and not bring it into the pool, and when you come out of the pool you can step on the cover and not wet ground from where the kids have been splashing water out. As for chemicals, you do need them. Buy a tester, or take your water to be tested. Get a floating chlorine dispenser, clearifier, and algaecide. We haven't used the last two yet, but you never know. So as a overview of the pool. You will get close to 15' across on the top if your ground is level and you will be able to get the 36"" if your ground is level. Add more air the next day to the upper ring since sun expands the vinyl some. Spend the extra money to get a pool cover, it will save on time wanting to get in the pool instead of fishing things out. I know I have done a lengthy review, but I hope this information has helped you, and saved you a little time looking around as I have at everyone elses complaints. It took my husband and I 8hrs from start to finish. My husband and I enjoy our pool, but not as much as our 2 kids.  So the extra work was worth it..."
3.0,We purchased the pool thinking we were getting a full 15 x 36 pool > Don't let the dimensions fool you.. After we set it up and measured the pools depth it is actually only about 28 inches deep and the pool is only 12 feet across the top...the 15 feet is the measurement across the very bottom only.  If you want a 15 x 36 pool you better buy the 18 x 42. I was very' disappointed in the size..as I can not use it for what we intended to use it for...A place for handicapped person to do water arobics in.  Pool may be fine for just the kids to play in.
5.0,"This pool, as discribed by others, does not set up in 10 minutes as advertised, unless you have an electric air pump to set it up.... If the ground is not exactly level you are unable to get a full 36"" of water in the pool.  The pump seems to work well with the pool even though it only filters 1/5 of the pool water an hour.  It seems to be easy to keep the chlorine level and ph balanced with the pool."
2.0,"This pool was a nightmare to set up!  I guarantee you, it will not be the ""30 minutes and ready for water"" as advertised.  The ground must be perfectly level and you will need at least 4 or 5 adults to set it up correctly.  It is next to impossible to get all the wrinkles out of the bottom.  And yes, you will need sand. (and lots of it!)  It is also dangerous if anyone leans on the walls from the outside or inside, as the walls easily collapse and let a flood of water come pouring out.  The filter pump that is supplied with the pool is too small to do an effecient job of cleaning.  All in all, this started out to be a $800.00 investment in summer fun and has ended up being a $1000.00 nightmare of stress!  Run the other way!"
5.0,"Finding the right location is the key. The spot you choose must be level. Once that is done the rest is cake. I'm a single mom and I put the pool together in about an hour and a half. The leveling took 2 days!  Still theres no sand needed and the ground cover that was included is perfact. This pool is very easy to maintain,but if you hang on the sides of the pool  ( like kids do ) you could very easily lose gallons of water and if your on a spring or well it's important to know."
5.0,I love this pool. It kept my kids cool all summer and was easy to set up and take down. Buy the chemicals to keep the water clean and your kids will have tons of fun with little effort on your part. Love my kids but they have more energy than I can keep up with especially when it's hot and I just want to sit under a tree. They can flip and flop for hours in this pool and it's shallow enough that you don't have to worry too much about them.
3.0,Does it come with a ladder
5.0,I purchase Intex Pool for my 7 yr old for Christmas  we can not used it still the summer we live in Detroit  Mi. DEC. Jan. Feb. March April are our cold season we can't  wait still the month of June to come so we an get in the Pool
5.0,I bought this late in the season so it is still in the box in the garage waiting to be put together for this next summer. so that being the case I don't have much to say in the way of reviews yet. I do look forward to using it this next summer. hopefully all will go well I did get a very good reasonable price on it.
5.0,Easy to install and maintain
4.0,fun
5.0,Had a great summer.
4.0,Perfect for our three year old. Easy to set up and maintain.
3.0,none at this time.
5.0,Good
5.0,Followed instructions and had zero issues getting the pool up by myself. I do think it would have been faster with help but not nessesary. Everything hooked up quick and easy. The pump works well and there were no holes in the pool. I got this pool on clearance for $125 wish I would have ordered 2
3.0,"we bought the 4' x 15' round version with the blowup ring. overall a good value for the $$. the pump is probably underrated for continuous use. ours lasted about 1 1/2 years and quit. ($90 to replace it) fairly quick set up, a day to fill with water and almost impossible to get all the wrinkles out of the bottom - oh well. biggest issue now after almost 2 summer seasons (Dallas), the top vinyl ring is starting to deteriorate due to sun damage (guessing here) small brown spot discolorations where the vinyl looks like it is starting to crack leaving tiny air leaks all around the top. the patches seem to work (we'll see if they hold over the winter in the garage). I would strongly suggest you cover it when not in use during the day to protect the vinyl ring from sun damage. we have never covered it. live and learn."
3.0,"This pool was fairly easy to set up. I had a handy friend level my ground for me, that was the biggest concern. Once that was done, it was fairly quick and issue-free. My problem is the pump. It's too small I believe for this size pool. I noticed that having it on the ground, when it was off, it would flood and water would come pouring out of the top. So I set it on an old aquarium and that solved the problem of leaking, but it doesn't pump well. So I have to turn it on, set it on the ground, then when done put it back on the aquarium. Not sure why but it does not run for long before turning itself off. Needless to say, this is quite a pain and not very effective. Other than than the crummy pump, it's a good pool though."
5.0,"I can't think of anything more enjoyable on a hot summer day than to be floating around in one of these pools!  They are easy to set up, one person can do it.  The most difficult part is getting all the wrinkles out of the floor and  maintaining clean water via the pump.  It's a must, otherwise the water will get dirty and stagnant.  I made the mistake of buying one that was 42"" high and I just could not get in it because the sides were too high for me.  The ladder is shakey, virtually useless.  I even bought a $200 Confer heavy duty ladder but that was way too high and unsteady.  Then I couldn't find the stabilizing extension kit.  I wasted that money for sure.  My pool is set up on my patio (level spot). The pool is so worth the money!  Fun, fun, fun!!"
4.0,"A little shallower than I wanted ( I wish I had bought the 18' x 42""), but otherwise a great little pool. My kids loved it this summer and we only had a few minor glitches. The pump is a little trooper. It was used to fill the pool from a creek as well as being allowed to run up to 3 days straight (oops).  One ""glitch"" - my kids let some of the air out of the upper ring. No one was in the pool and I just happened to remain outside. The water suddenly began flowing over the ring, pushing the side down - it was a problem that would have resulted in losing all of the water (and causing a flood in our basement as we have poor drainage), if I hadn't been there to hear the sudden rushing of water.  For the price just lasting this one summer makes it worth it."
3.0,I've had these pools for years and they really aren't that great if you don't know how to exactly level the ground it sits on.  Every year I have to buy the pool part of the package because I already have the extra.  I keep buing this pool because I have all the other components of the pool--ladder etc.
5.0,I enjoy these pools easy to set up and take down or buy the cover and cover for the winter just run the pump every once and a while and keep it chlorinated
5.0,Easy to set up & maintain!
5.0,"What do you do with the 16,000 gallons of water when the season is over????? Grandkids loved it but now they went home. Would buy it again next year. Easier to toss away then try to drain, clean, fold and store."
2.0,"I found any pool bigger than 10' the filter pump is not strong enough to filter it. You should buy the pool w/out filter system and upgrade to a sand filter system. And also, if you ever have a problem with VMINOVATIONS, they will pass the buck to the manufacturer."
3.0,It could have been better the water doesn't filter that well
4.0,The pool met my family's satisfaction.  We all can fit in and have fun.
5.0,"It said it was used, but it was brand new...  We have been having a ton of fun in thus pool...  It is perfect for my grandson... And perfect to float in...  I received this quickly and in perfect condition!!!  Thank you"
1.0,"Having previously owned two of the metal frame Intex pools, which were great, decided this year to get the Easy Set to have one that would be easier to set up (and take down). It wasn't. Took half a day. The metal frame pool took half an hour. With the Easy Set pool you have to hold the sides up as it fills or they'll fold over and fill with water and it won't expand to its full height (had to drain the pool twice and start over again!). You have to keep smoothing the bottom as it fills because the vinyl relies on the weight of the water to settle into its shape (not a problem with the metal frame as it stands up on its own already shaped even when empty). Honestly, having to stand and watch a pool fill with water is like watching paint dry. Finally got the water in the pool, set up the pumps (I use a salt water system which is brilliant!) and noticed the pool seemed much smaller than my previous 12x33 metal frame. The Easy Set has bowed sides, so it's actually only 15' across the bottom, way in under the rim (where you don't swim), and more like 12' across the top. The depth is not 36"" of water either, more like 28""--the measurement includes the blowup ring around the top. Which brings me to the dang blow up ring. It is what stabilizes pool. Without air in it your pool will collapse. If you lean on the sides it will also collapse and you will start a rushing waterfall that will flush you and half the water out of the pool. Since I set the pool up the end of May, it has inexplicably lost half its water several times and the ring has deflated. I've had to fill the ring with air and the pool with more water (and more salt). It was fine for about a month. Then last week it lost water again and the ring was almost complete deflated. Filled it and the next day there was only a few inches of water left in the pool and I'm pretty sure I've killed a big patch of my neighbors grass (salt water+grass=dead). Finally found a tiny, tiny pin hole in the top of the blowup ring. When it lost air, the top had collapsed and let all the water out. Fixed the pin hole with the supplied patch kit. It didn't hold. If a tiny pin hole in a rubber ring can cause a pool to empty out, then I think there's a design flaw. No point in trying to fill the pool again. I've given up. Will be getting one of the Intex Ultra Frame pools for next year. This one's going in the garbage. I love swimming--I hate this pool."
5.0,I fit our needs.
4.0,"We bought this 15 foot-36 inch Round Pool Set for our Grandkids who are 4 and 6 years old. It is the perfect size for them and will be used for at least 3 more years. As the other reviews said, it does take longer than half an hour to set up. The ground being level is helpful but if it is slightly off it's not worth the time or money to bring in sand to balance it perfectly.
The ""boys"" have called Grandma and Papa numerous times to say how much fun their pool is.

Well worth the money"
2.0,"Oh how I want to write a good review but I have owned like 5 of these already.  Forget year to year it's more like 2 per season.  The air chamber on top tends to either come with or quickly develop tiny holes.  SInce it is that which keeps the pool up, once the baloon thing goes the pool is useless.  Hours with soap trying to see where the bubbles are coming from, patching, starting over... then you have other issues.. if you aren't near it when it is filling it could fill lopsided, if that happens you may end up with the filtration portion not submersed at which point you have to start over.  Should you have to start over oy vey, the hole to remove the watter takes a whole day but worse than that it's a couple inches off the ground so when it's done draining you are still left with a bunch of water in there... do you spill it out? yeah if you are Hercules, I can't, so you grab a basin and dump until you can turn the whole thing over, by which time it stinks to high H and it's riffled with mosquitoes... oh and the water treatment is as bad as a real pool, cholorine check, algae treatment, who can be bothered, you just keep emptying the darned thing.  also, the thirty day warranty is an option, sure, but once you have filled that sucker with water how on earth are you EVER going to fold it back neatly enough to return it? You aren't.  If you bought local you can drag it to the store while the kids moan the whole way but on Amazon it's a whole new story which is why i just kept buying new ones twice a year. This year however  I was SUPER LUCKY that this last one came with the same issue and had to go back literally within a day or so of me using it and the CSR took pity on me and didn't make me return the old one, I just dragged it to the trash.  So... you may ask, why the heck do you keep buying them...? Because I always keep thinking I have mastered a new way of making it work and withing the pool context it is still very affordable..."
5.0,This is my second pool...the first one lasted 6 years.  this one is on its second year
5.0,Set up great after moved to more level spot then the first spot. lol
3.0,Pool arrived quickly but there was a hole in the ring so it was losing air!  No way we cud pack it back up in the box after it was out in the yard we patched the hole but really a brand new pool w/ a hole? That's why we bought a new pool cuz the old one had holes in the blow up ring
5.0,Great value!
5.0,As Described
1.0,"We set up the pool on level ground, instead of round it took the shape of an eclipse. We could not fill a 3 foot pool more than 1 foot. After a day in 85 degree weather, it started warp and water started to leak over the top."
5.0,FAbUlouS!! perfect size for my 4 year old to swim and room for me with my floating lounger
4.0,"Even though many reviews said it would be smaller than expected, it is still plenty big enough to exercise and relax!  My only issue is keeping the sides clean because (not the pool's fault), I don't have time to brush it down regularly.  It was a great deal - money well spent to keep cool in this central Florida heat!!"
5.0,Great pool for the grandchildren! Inexpensive entertainment!
5.0,great
1.0,"Imagine its the 4th of July & the family has been waiting all week for you to put up this great pool you bought.
All week you've been going from store to store getting accessories (chlorine, pool covers, ground liners, sifters, etc.)
You've read up on how to level the yard and you were out there in the heat earlier in the week leveling, making it smooth.
So this morning you put lay the ground tarp down as and then the pool as instructed. Everyone's pumped as it fills with water. Looks great in the yard and setting chairs around it as it fills.  Hours later it's almost filled and its level as can be. THEN. You go in the house for a bit, come out to find a big freaking puddle of water on the ground at one end of the pool. It has a bad leak somewhere that you cant see. You're upset. Family's upset. You've spent all this time for nothing and now YOU have to roll the monstrosity up to return it. Happy Fourth of July."
5.0,This is an awesome product to add for family summer fun! A great addition at hosting get together parties with family and friends! No hassle - easy to use assembly!
5.0,Great product.  Delivered to my door and easy to set up.  I tried storing one over the winter.  Bad idea...a lot of work to clean for storage and several leaks the following year.  For the price...I will avoid the frustration and just buy a new one next year.
1.0,I tried to set up the pool last night and it will not hold water or air in the ring.  I believe the plastic was damaged in shipping.  Amazon was going to send me a replacement HOWEVER..it will not be available until the summer is over...I live in upstate NY and the summers are short anyway. If I could afford it I would buy a pool locally but I spent the money on this one instead.......I am not happy and either are the kids...
2.0,"I've had Intex pools before.  We started with an 18' and loved it when we lived in a location where we had a very level yard.  It was great.  When we moved and realized we had a sloping back yard we took the time to add fill dirt and sand to create a more level area.  This was never perfect so we always had a slightly ""deeper"" end but the pool, first the 18' and later a replacement 15' x 42"", served it's purpose and allowed the kids to play and us adults to cool off.  Finally, after downsizing to the 15' the lawn began to erode and our incline got steeper and the pool washed out a few years ago.  We got rid of it and took a break last year and didn't put one up.  Which brings us to this year and this pool.

Our teen grandson offered to re-level the area for our pool and spend a day building up the steep end, shoring it up and getting it level.  I found this 15' x 36"" online for a steal (I thought) for about $120.  (My bad for not realizing it was the 36"" and not the 42"" that we'd previously had so I am not factoring that into my rating!)  So, we got the pool, were already familiar with how to put it up, that part went smoothly.  It didn't come with the ground cover as previous sets had but we used two tarps we already had, problem solved.  I spend some time as it filled using my bare feet to smooth the wrinkles.  It was filling pretty level it seemed, we got the pump hooked up with no problem and we waited for it to fill.  Later that afternoon we went out and the pool was a bit over knee height on me but was looking good.  Then, I noticed that there was not much more room between the water level and the blow up ring.  I lifted the ring and realized that there was only a few inches of slack wall to fill.  The pool was short.  Very short.  I then realized we had the 42"" previously but even so, this was nowhere near the 36"" promised.  We let the pool fill until there was no room left to fill and then checked it out.  The top of the ring measures only about 32"" and the water level is about 26"" at best, about mid-thigh on me.  Crazy.  Then we noticed that the bottom seams were spread way out on ground.  Like I said, we've had this brand and style pool before and I've never seen anything like this.  A good third of what should be wall is laying on the ground which means the pool is like a giant kiddie pool.  Now, we're keeping it since essentially that's all we need.  We sit in it like it's a hot tub and our 8 year old grand-daughter gets to splash around.  It's just not worth draining, drying it out, repacking it, and paying for return postage to send it back and we surely don't feel like taking a chance with a replacement.

But, beware... check the height you order and be careful as it seems the one we got was cut wrong or seams weren't laid out right.  Otherwise, we've enjoyed these pools in the past which is why I'm able to bump my rating up to 2 stars instead of 1."
2.0,We like the pool and the pump is robust. I was disappointed to find out the first day that the ring won't stay inflated though. I haven't found the hole or tried to patch it yet. Just disappointed that a new product had such a pretty big defect right away. My other complaint was that setup wasn't a cinch. The video helped but it took me a bit to figure out what all the parts were. Overall my kids are thrilled to have the pool!
5.0,It is perfect for my granddaughter.  Will need the bigger one in a couple of years.  She is 3 now but a fantastic swimmer so a bigger one will be needed.
2.0,"This did not come with the liner or blanket for under the pool. Amazon told me to box this back up and send it back (it was Prime) but how to fold this huge pool back up and cram into the small box? Impossible! Had to go buy tarps and blanket myself, cost me over $50! Amazon said they would credit me back $26 but I've yet to receive a confirmation or an email confirming this. When I contacted them online, Amazon said they would get back to me within 10 days, day 8 still no reply. Pool and pump seem to be okay, but take your time leveling your spot, it's not easy to get level at all."
1.0,"I bought this pool for my granddaughter with the ladder, cover & filters.  I received the pool in about 1 week but the rest didn't show up.  I called and emailed the company and all they said was sorry & they would resend the product. Two weeks later it showed up. Mean while I gave the pool to my granddaughter for her birthday but to only last one day and the pump went out. I have called, emailed and nothing yet 2 weeks now has past!  Very poor customer service !"
5.0,Best pool we ever purchased. Looks so nice and went up so quickly. The kids love it!
5.0,"Good pool.  Great for younger kids.  My 4 yr old can stand in the pool very comfortably, but still deep enough and wide enough for her to swim. I'd recommed a ladder to get in and out of much easier, plus kids can jump off it!  You can rinse the filter and reuse very easily. buy a chlorine float."
5.0,"This pool sets up in our backyard in May every year,and gets drained after Labor Day.
You needn't worry about liners splitting in the winter,or that filthy green slime when you remove the cover in springtime like you do on a permanent aboveground pool."
5.0,This is a very simple pool to set up once the wife reads the directions.  It is important to remember that after an inch of water is in the pool to start getting the wrinkles out from the bottom.  It will not set up right if it's not on level ground.
4.0,"This was actually a present to my granddaughter. The family loved it! They found it easy to set up & got alot of use out of it.
Only downside was that it didn't come w a cover"
5.0,Great product Easy setup and easy to take care of. Wonderful and relaxing on hot days.  Would recommend to anyone.
2.0,I bought this pool in may and it was great until the ring won't stay filled up. I cant find a hole anywhere but it keeps leaking slowly... i will not be getting another one..
5.0,"I love this pool.  It is the perfect size.  Only critique would be the location of the outflow of the pump and the screws used to keep the intake cover in place.  Otherwise, it is perfect.  I love it and use it daily."
4.0,"we had to level the ground with sand (a lot of sand) and it took about 5 hours to do it right (including a trip to buy the sand) there is a few little rocks under the pool that we didn't know of but so far no leaks. The pool is great no leaks or anything (this is our first year and its been up for 4 weeks)

BUT!!!!
1. Check your town codes!!! We had to get the town to check the electric on the house, the variance from neighbors fence and our fence. This is a real pool and your insurance and the town will see it as such!

2. The pool isn't 36 inch deep! (it was my duh of course it isn't moment) The pool is more like 29 inches deep.
My son who is 50in so still play and his friends love it. I can swim under water  and sit down and still have my head above the water (I am 5'6) (this is the only reason we didn't give it 5 stars!)  We do the 15ft across perfect length for 2 adults and 1-2 kids to play. and you can actually teach a child how to swim in this pool."
1.0,"We received our pool today and our kids were so excited.  Spent our Saturday reading instructions and setting up the pool only to find out that is has three different holes/small leaks in it.  Now what?  Do we spend the rest of our Saturday draining and dismantling this thing.  What a waste of water, time and energy."
3.0,"We got this because it wasn't very expensive and figured it was better than not having a pool! We plan to put in an inground pool in a few years, but wanted to be able to cool off this summer too.

It's a nice size, though it says 15 x 36, the dimensions are based on the widest and tallest areas. So when it's all set up and ready to go, it's really about 30 in of water or so. And the 15 ft is the bottow diameter, so the top opening is really around 13.5 ft or so? I didn't measure, I am just guessing by looks. Not bad though, it's still big enough for us to fit 2 large floats to lay on and the kid still has room to walk/swim/float around too.

I imagine it won't last too long in the AZ heat, but it wasn't all that expensive and if we can get one good year (or two) out of it, that will be worth it. I actually would say as much as we've used it so far it's already paid for itself.

It did come with problems though!
  1) The little valve where you can drain it leaks. There's a plug in it, it's screwed on as tight as it can be, but still it has a very slow consitent drip.
  2) The tube on the top must have a leak. I find myself re-filling the tube with air once a week."
5.0,cheaper than walmart and we love it!! already swimming on 80 degree weather!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! don't miss out on this great savings
5.0,I purchased this pool for my grandchildren. They love it! Next year I will be looking for a bigger pool for the grandchildren.
1.0,I'm so disappointed after I have spend all day setting this up to find out the ring of the pool is on the inside.
4.0,"Just finished setting up my 15 ft x 3 ft pool.  I read others reviews and want to emphasize as well that the ground must be level or the pool won't fill up correctly.  My two boys and I (ages 9 and 7) set it up by ourselves and while it was a hot job, it only took about 2 hours.  I did watch the video and read lots of other reviews and took the advice given.  AFter reading quite a few negative comments about how thin the ground cover was I bought a big tarp to go under mine.  So far so good. The kids are loving it!  Just follow the instructions and it works just great."
3.0,We bought the so called 15x30 pool last July. It was not to bad to set up but it got over 100 degrees here for almost a month and the bottom and sides melted and wrinkled. We put it away in our garage for winter storage and set it up last week. The pool has so many holes in it that its now garbage! My best advice is to buy it somewhere that offeres the 1 year warranty as we did. So glad!
1.0,"If you purchase an INTEX Easy Set pool, and you live in a region that requires you to take the pool down for the winter, you should understand that you are essentially purchasing a $100 disposable pool.  The pool will not make it through the winter stored in the garage without cracking.  We purchased an Easy Set pool in July, 2009, took it down in September, 2009, and then tried to set it up again in May, 2010.  The morning after we set up the pool, we discovered that the inflatable ring that keeps the pool from spilling out had gone completely flat because it was riddled with little pin-prick sized holes.  After spending two-weeks trying to indentify and patch all of the little holes (I stopped after patching 8 of them), I finally emptied the pool and threw it in the garbage in disgust.  The Easy Set pools only carry a 90-day warranty, which I learned only after calling INTEX customer service.  (Nowhere could I find warranty information in the materials that came with the pool.)  Not only was INTEX unwilling to send me a new pool, they wouldn't even send me a coupon for a discount on another pool.  Now I have to decide if I want to spend another $100 on a disposable pool, or if I should just take my daughter to the lake.  It seems like such a waste to have to throw these things in a landfill just because of a ""few"" little holes."
1.0,"We loved the pool (3' x 12') until my kids got comfortable with the pool. My 2 year old daughter (who weighs 27 pounds) put her weight on the side of the pool edge. In doing so, she collapsed the edge washing her and some of the pool water out of the pool. She was terrified as was her sister. After this, we took the pool down and gave it away to friends who do not have children. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else."
5.0,"I just love this pool! It is perfect for my two boys, ages 5 and 2. The whole family fits in there without bumping into each other!"
5.0,"We have had an intex pool for about 4 years now. I started with a 10 x 30, upgraded to a 12 x 36, and this year we went for a 15 x 36 (the biggest my yard will hold). The first thing is to check with your village or town to see if you need a building permit. We did, it was only $50, and carries over from year to year. The most important thing is to have a perfectly level spot. This is the hardest for me, since my yard slopes downhill, but I invest a full day and about 600 lbs of sand and peat moss to get it right. Once it is level, the rest is cake. It really is as easy as the box says. My kids love it, not only the 10 year old, but the older teenagers have a blast in it. I highly recommend it as long as you are willing to do the maintenance."
1.0,"We set this up, and it leaked all around the seam! We tried refilling the intertube part, it leaked again all around the seam! We're out our money because we bought it on clearance last year.  DONT BOTHER!"
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING!MY 5 YR OLD SON LOVES IT.ALOT BIGGER THAN WHAT I PICTURED.
4.0,"We purchased this for our daughters birthday.  We haven't had it long enough to rate it's durability(3 or 4 weeks).  Set up was really easy and even though our lawn isn't perfectly level it works just fine.  There's about 1"" to 1 1/2"" more water on one side then the other, but unless you're looking for that it's not that noticeable and she's having fun in it.  So far, we're very happy with the purchase.

***update***
2011 we were able to use this pool for 3 summers...probably would have lasted longer in warmer climate, but we live in a cold winter area and had to take it down each year to store it.  It may have lasted one more summer, but we had to keep inflating the ring this year and my husband didn't want to hassle with it next year..Still, for 3 years I think that's pretty good for the price we paid."
5.0,Five years ago I bought a pool from Costco for twice as much as I paid for this one. I like the Intex pool better. It was very easy to set up even a caveman can do it. HA! HA! HA! And the filter unit is so quiet you can't hear it. My old filter moter was so loud and would freeze up on me I would have to hit it hard to get it going. It is a great deal for summer fun. Our family started enjoying it before it was full. The only thing this set didn't come with was the ladder. But I used my old one from the previous pool. You can't go wrong with this pool especially if you have a small backyard.
5.0,"This is our 3rd pool. If you take care of it, it will last a long time. wonderful deal in free shipping."
5.0,"Before I purchased this pool, I read a lot of reviews and thought about any problems that people had noted.  I got prepared before the pool arrived by leveling the ground.  That takes some work but any above ground pool would require the ground to be level.  Also, since I had read in other reviews that the water won't be as deep as the manufacturer says, I ordered the pool a little deeper than I actually needed.  I ordered the 15' x 36"" pool knowing that it would be shallower than that.  I would say the water is actually about 2 1/2 feet deep.  As far as setup time, it's about 1 hour once you have the ground level.  I used an air compressor to blow up the ring and that saved a ton of time.  It is easy to setup though.  I did it by myself with my 2 kids ""helping"" me.  All in all, I think this is a good value and a perfect pool for me and my kids."
5.0,"It was helpful to read prior reviews and watch the pool set-up DVD.  Pool set-up was very straightforward.  Removing the filter to clean and keeping the chemicals in balance has been straightforward as well.
The pool is a lot of fun!  Invest in a ladder and a floating chlorine dispenser, set up a bucket to rinse feet before getting in the pool, and you should be good to go.
After reading reviews about the poor quality of the pool cover, we opted to not purchase one.  Pool is staying in balance and debris is not a problem.
This pool already is our favorite activity this year!  I think it was well worth the relatively small expensive."
4.0,"We love this pool. Is very easy to set up and is ready to use right away. We had a 12' pool last year and decided we'd like a bigger one, so we bought the 15' for next season. The maintenance is super easy and the pool stays clean with just a little chemical treatment twice a week and the use of a cover at night. My boys (7 & 8) have taught themselves to snorkel in the pool. They love it! And so do some of the neighbor kids. They're coming over often now to get in too, especially when they hear my kids squealing from several houses away!"
1.0,"We bought this pool kit because it had all of the equipment you needed to run a pool and the box said that it was EASY to SET up. Well, the only way that this pool is easy to set up is if you have a backyard that was leveled by God.

We worked with this pool for over a week trying to get it to fill properly. We borrowed a 12ft level and placed 10 bags of sand on the ground to ensure that everything was level and smooth. This pool just did not want to fill level. It leaned to one side, then leaned to another side and in the end we broke our backs hauling 500 pounds of sand, a pool liner and multiple accessories. We wasted probably 1,000 gallons of water filling and emptying the pool. Every time we thought we had it perfectly centered and laid out, we would walk away and let the pool fill some more. When we would come back 20 mins later, we would find the pool leaning to one side and water spilling out. It always filled nicely the first foot of water and then started to go lopsided after that.

It looks like a good idea and probably works if you live in a perfect world where things are easy to set up. I live in a world that apparently is a smig out of level, which is just too much for this pool to tolerate.

If you have a 16ft concrete slab that was professionally leveled, then you may be successful with this pool."
4.0,"This is a great ""starter pool""  The diamater is perfect for the whole family to enjoy.  The depth isn't scary for little kids, but isn't deep enough for any ""real"" swimming by a bigger kid or adult.

Set up was easy.  Just make sure you have ALL protrusions removed from the area in which you will be setting up the pool.  Once we started filling with water we found more, even though we thought we found them all!  So be forewarned!

Filling took MUCH longer than suggested on the box, but we still swam the weekend of purchase.

The filter is worthless, except to disolve chlorine tablets.  You will still need to skim and vaccuum REGULARLY even with a cover.

Next year we are going to get a deeper version because we love the product!"
4.0,"my kids loved this pool- the first year. tried to set this up the following year only to find hole after hole in the air tubing. after the 5th patch I now cannot find the last of the leaks and believe me i tried. the smallest blade of dried grass or fine pebble can wreak havoc on the thin air tube lining during storage. for sure, this pool is a one time use only toy, don't think too far in future with this one. by the way, if the ground is not perfectly level, enjoy the deep end!"
3.0,"The pool is super easy to set up and my kids really like the it.  While they may already be 15 and 12 years old, they are excited to cool off in the pool.  The younger kids next door have enjoyed it too.  Since we live in an area where outdoor pools are only practical for a short time, this is a great alternative and will be easy to store for next year.

My only concern is that if a child is tool small to ""step"" over the top of the pool, they may fall in."
3.0,"We bought this pool and had a LOT of fun with it the first year. However, our cat, or neighborhood cats would jump up on the side to get a drink from the dew collected on the cover and they put all kinds of small holes in the inflatalble ring. So many that it was unrepairable. So, if you have cats around....beware."
2.0,"I live in Phoenix, which has a habit of getting over 110 on a regluar basis in the summer. After having this pool for a few days, the first thing I noticed was that the water quickly became too hot to swim in (mine got to just over 100 degrees). But the next problem was the dealbreaker. With the sun beating down on the pool, the outside of the PVC lining and the floating ring got extremely hot to the touch. After a few days, the seams began to pull apart on the side of the pool that was facing the sun, as if the adhesive used to bond the seams was failing. Eventually, the pool burst open.

So in theory, this pool is a good value. The filter worked well (you can buy replacement filters at walmart or target), and it was easy to set up. The water depth is usually 6-9 inches less than the stated depth of the pool, and the actual diameter is actually a few feet less than the stated diameter (the pool tapers inward toward the top). Just beware of the sun!"
1.0,"I first owned a 12x30 Intex Pool that lasted for 4 years without any leaks or any other issues.  After the fourth season the pool started to fall apart.  I thought that 4 seasons was outstanding for a $100 pool. Based on this, I purchased another Intex Pool. This time I bought the 15x36 pool. I noticed that the quality was not even close to the first Intex pool I owned. Nonetheless the pool worked great for 1 season. However, I just started to set the pool up today after properly drying and storing for the winter.  Upon filling the pool up, it was literally falling apart.  I lost count at 12 holes. The material of this pool is very low quality and not designed to be folded without cracking. It is only good for one season.  STAY AWAY FROM INTEX unless you only plan on only using it for one season.  IT WILL NOT SURVIVE WINTER STORAGE. JUNK! JUNK!JUNK!"
5.0,"...It took my husband about 30 minutes to set up and start filling it. Our back yard isn't completly level but it works great. When we put it up next season we will try to get the ground more level. We don't have any complaints as of yet. We have five chlidren 6,9,10,11,and,12 years of age. They love it! For the price it is worth it. As far as other complaints...You get what you pay for. It takes common sense. The pool is made of plastic. If you go into this with the expectations of the durability of a built in pool you are going to be disapointed. Even if I had to replace the whole pool every summer, it is affordable and worth it. The pump is so quiet you won't have any complaints from neighbors. The pool cover is also great. We love it! I hope this review helps. Thanks!"
5.0,This product worked fine for one season. We carefully stored it for the winter and the pool literally fell apart at the start of the second season. The company laughed off any suggestion of a warranty the second year. Pretty expensive pool for just one season.
4.0,"Having bought and set up this pool,I found that the retailer,Toys-R-US, could not supply the needed chemicals or the replacement filter cartridge that the manufacturer recommends to replace every two weeks"
4.0,"I am a single mom and was looking for a pool a little larger than the blow up pools you can now buy, but my main factor was that I needed one that was easy to set up.  After reading many online reviews and finding no positive reviews for the steel sided pools I decided to purchase this one. NO .... it does not set up in 10 minutes but I was able to set it up by myself.  My first mistake, what I thought was level ground was not!  I needed to drain the pool and with only a little water left in it move it around the yard to find a level spot which much to my dismay there is no completely level ground in my back yard.  I picked the least level spot and took my chances and filled the pool.  (Oh by the way, make sure you have an electric pump to fill the ring or you will be totally exhausted by the time you finishing pumping)  Once I found a spot it was fairly easy and even though the ground wasn't completely level it filled nicely.  The filter was also very easy to install. You will have to take a sample of the water to a pool suppy store for testing.  They will then let you know what chemicals need to be added and how to maintain the pool.  It will take one full day to add chemicals and let them cirrculate in the pool before the kids can swim.  You may also want to buy a skimmer to help keep the pool clean as there is no vacumn attachment. My 6 yr. old daughter and her friends are totally enjoying the pool, its hard to get them to come out for dinner!!! We adults can enjoy it to as it is big enough to put a raft in and get some sun!!"
5.0,"We bought this pool after much time reading reviews, and looking around. There are no complaints coming from this house. I believe it doesn't really matter if it takes a day to complete and water to warm, that is allot easier than digging a 6 foot hole in your yard.  The only complaint, is cleaning the pool. I have a woodsy backyard,so many sticks, and such. The cover does help but not on a hot day.. that causes algae.  I had an infestation of mosquito larvae, and had to shock the pool. I wish I would have known all of this because that is what have stopped me from buying the pool. If your looking for fun, steardynes.. you have found a great pool. I even floated around on a raft, and had some sun.  My only advice is to make sure you want the responsibility of taking care of a pool.  Oh and my neighbor has a bigger one, so our's lost the glow once they opened there's..  : )
Good luck!"
3.0,"If you think you get 36 inches with this Pool,think again. We set it up total level ground and have only 23 inches of water. The outside Ring its only 30 inches high not 36 inches as it showes on the box. We could not believe it. A waste of money. If you have kids,you better watch them all the time,they can not jump around in it to much. The Ring its totally unstable. Friends of ours have the same Pool from a other Company. Same kind,different name. You can jump and play as much as you like on the Ring without any problem. Watch out People,do your homework. We have the Pool now filled and have to waste the water to try to send it back. Not to think about the tears of the kids. But for 23 inches of wet fun,ican buy a kiddiepool for 25 or 30 Dollars."
4.0,"In one day we set the pool up and were swimming by the afternoon.  We have had hard sided pools in the past and it took about a week to level the ground, get all rocks out, set up with sand and walls.  Since it was so hard to set up, we kept it up all winter long.  Within three years the liner had holes in it and the sides were rusted.  This is easy set-up and easy to take down.  We hope that it last years to come. ..."
1.0,"we recently bought this pool and replaced our old 15' pool.  It is much smaller than our old pool.  Intex said we were not measuring it right, at the widest point (about 6"" from the bottom) it is only a 13' 8"" pool. very dissapointed that we down sized by buying a new pool. the difference is 20% less water volume and 60 square feet of surface area.  It is like swimming in a barrel."
4.0,"This is my first edger purchase, and so far so good.  My big concern was power; I purchased a gas-powered week whacker because I had heard from a variety of sources that the electric ones were under-powered.  But this edger has plenty of power for my needs, and although I was a total novice at this task I was edging in no time.  I agree with other reviewers that the instructions are esentially worthless, but you don't need them anyway."
3.0,"This is a good basic edger, but it is best suited for small lawns because you have to drag that (...) cord around.  I like not having to maintain another gas can with an oil-and-gas mixture, but if you have to edge quite a ways from an outlet, the extension cords can be just as big a battle.  I've had good results from Black and Decker and you don't have to edge every week, so overall I'm happy."
2.0,"I bought the Black & Decker LE750 Heavy Duty Edge Hog 2-in-1 Landscape Edger because I thought it would be easier to use than the GH400 Grass Hog.  Not so, I tried used the product but went back to the grass hog.  Its okay for digging trenches - if thats all you need it for.  Unless I'm overlooking the obvious, its of little use to me."
5.0,"This is the latest version of an edger B&D has been making for at least 20 years, and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use. It's nearly silent, much easier to use than a gas model, and seems to  cut better with less stalling than my neighbor's 3.5HP gas model."
5.0,Very easy to use.  You can easily get straight edges as well as curves.  Did wonders around flower beds.  Highly recommended!
2.0,"Black & Decker's decision to manufacture a cordless string trimmer is right in line with my belief that most people don't want messy, smelly, gas powered lawn/landscaping equipment or the hassle of tugging around an  electric cord to get your tool where you need it. Today's cordless tools  provide the power needed, without the hassle, to get the job done. I have  been chomping at the bit to get a cordless string trimmer (and hedge  trimmer) to add to my arsenal of cordless tools, all while cursing my 100'  electric cord. When B&D announced their 12"" trimmer I was ecstatic...  then let down. Annoying vibration and unnecessary weight were two small  gripes, but my biggest is B&D's choice not to standardize battery  packs. Ryobi had the right idea, using the same battery for their drills  and saws, as they do for the string trimmers and hedge clippers, but the  12V is too weak (IMO). B&D went with a grossly larger and heavier  battery pack on this unit than their equivalent Voltage batteries on the  B&D/DeWalt drills and saws.  Why? So us consumers (even though brand  loyal) have to have two different chargers and two different types of  battery packs (one superior and one inferior)? Also, we consumers do not  benefit from their (B&D/DeWalt's) added costs to manufacture and  inventory additional batteries and chargers, which results in a more  expensive product. Bad decision Black & Decker/DeWalt. Thanks, for not  much."
5.0,"I bought this trimmer in the spring of 2002..
I have used it now for a total of 7 summers..
It does what I ask it to.. to trim the grass that the lawn mower does not.
That includes around the house, around 3 decks, around a couple of
flower beds, around the motor home, the mail box, some bushes, and around some trees..
Indeed, the battery is near dead when I'm done.  But by then it has
done what I wanted it to do."
5.0,"I live on a .4 acre lot and was sick of wrestling with cords, plus I couldn't see spending $200+ on a gas-powered trimmer, so I bought this one and couldn't be happier.  I can do my entire lot and then 1/2 of the lot again (a week later) on a single charge.  Mine came with two batteries, so battery power is not an issue.  It changes to edging mode in a flash and cuts well.  My only gripe is that the 12"" cutting zone is a bit small, but I love this trimmer.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,"I had my doubts ordering this, but I've been using it for a few month now, and it's the best trimmer I've ever had!!  I love it!!  I can trim my yard now without stopping every minute to re-spool the stupid roll!!  I agree with others about the battery - it dies after about 20 minutes, but I gladly sacrifice that part for excellent performance!!"
5.0,I simply love this machine! I have been so pleased with this weed eater.  Like it MUCH better than the ones with the 18V batteries.  I have used both and the internal battery charge lasts much longer.  Love it!
5.0,"Had mine 9 years. Have to replace battery twice ($15 @ radio shack. Its a std 12V dry cell) now worn out i just searched Hi and low for another as this is a discontinued model. Its still the best for 1/4 acre lots and smaller. Lite, Ergonomic and less of a pain than corded or gas. You will not be disappointed. This is better that the 18V Nicad versions since it can half-recharge and not have battery memory issues."
5.0,this is my second trimmer. i have three rental properties that i maintain.the first one lasted three years. it worked fine and got about 45 minutes of use. it trimmed very well and edged very well. it is a little heavy but it is a strong unit. i bought my second trimmer last year. i broke the first unit by mistake. now i have a second battery in the event i need the power. i tried the 18 volt trimmer but returned it due to the battery running out after about 15 minutes of use. they do supply two batteries but you only get another 15 minutes. the 12 volt is much more power full than the 18 volt unit. go figure.i highly recommend this unit.
1.0,"Don't know how ANYONE except B&D can claim good battery life on this thing !!!  15 minutes if you are lucky.  B&D couldn't care less !
Will NOT buy another one !  Rating should be ""0"""
3.0,"I really like this trimmer and one charge allows me to do my entire yard (trimming and edging) unless I let it go for a couple weeks. The first one was fine except the handle broke from normal use. Probably could have ordered a replacement, but decided to get another CST2000 so I could have a spare battery and trimmer. The second trimmer turns out to be junk. It might work or not, must be a connection or wiring issue. Since I now have 2 batteries I'm forced to order another trimmer."
5.0,"I don't know how long the battery charge lasts because it lasts longer than I do at 61. I am still on my first reel of string, too, though that should change since I'll be using it more this year than I did last year.

I love not having to do anything for the string to stay at the right length.

The weight of the thing is actually good for me--might help with these ""blackboard arms""(you know, the swinging triceps that you saw when your old grade school teacher wrote on the chalkboard) and maybe even provide a little aerobic benefit.

Someone else mentioned that it is easy to put away and get out again, which makes more work get done and that was a good observation and true.

All in all, if you have an average body and average home and yard, you will be very happy with this deal--and no shipping charge!"
1.0,"Had been mulling over options for a cordless trimmer for awhile.  I wanted gas, wife was pushing for battery powered for lighter weight.  Price was very good on this trimmer so decided to give it a shot.  Have a number of Black & Decker power tools that I love, but couldn't be more disappointed in this product.  Even with a full battery charge it isn't really powerful enough to do a clean job with even basic trimming and edging - was having to make several passes when trimming the grass along the fence line.  We have a smallish suburban corner lot and by the time I got down one side of the front yard the cutting power was so weak it wouldn't cut through runners in the St. Augustine if I just held it in one place.  Frustrated, I stuck it back in the garage and finished the job with our old corded trimmer.  Never would have guessed anything could make me appreciate that thing, but the Black & Decker trimmer managed it.

If you must have a battery powered trimmer, look elsewhere.  For my money, our next one's going to be gas."
5.0,"For five years I have worked my trimmer hard.  Last week it died on me.  It paid for itself.  I did think of upgrading to the 18 volt but just last month I bought a spare battery. Also thought about gas but...........
For what I use mine for light edging and trimming it's ok.  But for anything more you may need an electric or gas.  My neighbor lets me use her old electric one.  WOW is that powerful!!!!.  But between the cord and having to bump every few minutes, I'm all set.  It is good to use once in a while to get that nice sharp edge.  Buying a new 12 volt this week."
4.0,"I bought this trimmer/edger for my tiny yard (1/5 acre) and I'm very happy with it thus far. A few comments:

* Battery life - my yard requires about 10 minutes of trimming/edging so the battery was fine for me

* Trimming - works well, the auto string feed is a nice feature

* Edging - works much better than I anticipated. It has an edging guide that steers you on your path and the string really does have the power to do the job

* Form factor - the unit is relatively light weight and easy to assemble. The conversion from edger to trimmer is a breeze. My only complaint is that the ""battery"" is really the entire top head of the unit - the black area in the picture. If you have the space to wall mount the charger and hang the recharger then it's not an issue; but if you don't, and you don't want to bring the entire unit inside to charge, then you have to disconnect that entire black head area and plug it in. Would be nice if the battery was smaller and the more traditional rectangular battery that other tools use"
5.0,"I have taken my battery in every winter and it still holds a charge. This trimmer is good for work that is kept up, you are not going to go into an untrimed yard mid summer and fix it. I do some trimming before I mow return it to the charger then finish up after. We have a big country yard. I like it a lot better than stinking like gas and getting blisters trying to start a small engine. I am short and find this to be proportioned for me."
3.0,"It does a great job but... I find that I can only handle it for a few minutes at a time. It is way too heavy for a woman unless she had been working out with weights. I have a very large yard with lots of plants. I would have done better buying one with a cord. The one I had, also B&D, was perfect even if I had to pull along the cords (100' total)."
4.0,"This trimmer gives just enough performance.  I have a small lot with the only power at the far end. I just do not like getting the 150' extension cord out to do the last bit of trimming on the lawn.  With this trimmer I do not have to, so I trim more often.  Now, ""She Who Must be Obeyed"" has other things to say about my work...

The auto-feed function does not seem to work for me.  (I have found that a silicone lube spray works wonders for this kind of thing)  The battery and charger are fine. I never take the battery off of the trimmer.

Do not leave this thing in the garage over the winter.  These batteries will not take being frozen!!! I keep mine in the basement.  These batteries can not be run down to zero and give good service life.  Make sure you recharge the battery often and never run it down to zero."
1.0,"Manufacture says will trim 1/2 acre on single charge, but I can never completely complete the edging of my small front lawn and median on a single charge, much less do any triming. Also the plastic handle broke and have since had to jury rig a fix for it."
4.0,"We've had this for over three years and the trimmer has worked great.  A little heavy, but fine for 1/3 acre lot.  Battery power was never an issue.  The autofeed feature has always worked fine.  This is our second B&D cordless trimmer and this one was definately a good choice.

After three years, the battery won't hold a charge.  If I find a replacement battery, I'm sure this will last another three years.  The battery is not interchangable with the FireStorm batteries like some of the newer trimmers.  That's the only drawback."
3.0,"When I first used this product I thought it was going to be an exercise in the throw-away product mentality that now seems to be creeping from inside-the-home to outside-the-home consumer goods where it certainly doesn't belong! Personally, I'm hard on my tools and I expect for them to take the beating and last a good long time. That's bad on me, I guess.

Well, what I didn't expect is the fondness that I'd get for this product in doing its job well over the last couple of years. Don't expect it to do weeds and use it for lawn edging only and it rewards. That's good.

I don't have a large lawn... maybe 1500 sq feet and I can only get 2/3 of it done before the battery runs dry. And when it starts to go... forget it! You won't make it that last 6 feet that you'd so much like to reach to keep your job from looking half-baked. That's bad.

The self-feeding seems to work well from the factory spool and not so well from the ones I've spooled manually. That's good and bad.

My initial fears were realized a week ago when the trimmer slipped from my hand and broke at the neck. The battery is damn heavy and the neck is hollow injection-molded nominal wall. No ribbing... nada... in fact there's no reinforcement whatsoever to keep this from happening. You see, I'm not just a grass cutter hobbyist but a freelance product designer specializing in plastics. This is an obvious weak spot and is unrepairable when it happens. No amount of superglue, tape, cable ties or hose clamps is gonna fix it. That's bad.

Looking from the wet half of the glass, I now have a broken unit for spare parts and that much needed spare battery by making the decision to buy another. I'm that much smarter now full-well knowing the weaknesses going in. That's good.

Then I saw the price. Yeow! I can't believe I paid that the first time around for a throw-away garden tool. I must have gotten this as a gift. That's bad.

Yet, 2 years later and they still make this item allowing me to make use of the battery from the wounded unit. That's just plain remarkable in today's consumer product market. That's good. Real good.

I'd give it 3-1/2 stars if I had the choice, but I don't. I'll give it 3 stars. I'm fond of the unit, but the weak neck design and limited battery life are too much to overlook. Also, using it for anything other than its intended use would garner a big zero. Keep the gas weedeater for the woods... this one is grass-only."
1.0,"I am unhappy with the trimmer it does trim the edge but it is almost impossible to get the power pack detached from the trimmer so it can charged.

Maybe just this ""one"" is not working correctly. But it is the only one I have.

Unhappy.

Matt Trivelli"
4.0,"I like this weed eater a lot. It's light and runs good. I like the ability to swivel the neck to use as an edger.

However, like others have said, the motor of these weed eaters burns out after a while. Almost like clockwork, my edger, and a friend's, burns-out after about 3 years.

But when that happens, I keep the battery and charger so I always have a second charged battery for long edgings.

The fact it's cheap, only about $70 bucks, it's convenient, and I like it a lot, I just buy it knowing I'll probably buy another one in three years.

Still would recommend."
5.0,"I have had the cordless trimmer for a few years.  I also have the cordless mower and blower which makes Mowing, trimming and clean-up a snap (no cords, no gas, simply grab and go).

I particularly like the edger feature on the trimmer, where you flip down the wire guide and rotate the head. Once I had established the edge, I simply insert the metal guide next to the concrete and walk the trimmer on down - A perfect edge every time. When I am done, I hang the unit on the wall charger bracket where it trickle charges until the next use.  I still have an old gas trimmer for semi-annual heavy cutting in the Ivy and such, but the cordless is the first one I reach for. My lawn is about 1000 squarefeet and it works fine. If you have a small yard, and are regularly trimming and edging grass, this is for you!!"
4.0,"I have a rechargeable mower and weed eater from Black and Decker.  Both work on my yard great.  I have had them for about 3 years a piece.  My only complaint is the way the weed eater battery attaches and removes.  You have to press a button on each side simultaneoulsy and push the battery off with a third hand or a shoulder, wall, or something.  I would love to see a saleman or B&D expert demonstrate."
1.0,"We have very light duty for this-- use it every other week for 10 min max.  Unfortunately, it did not last more than 18 months before it design flaw was exposed: an all-plastic neck juncture that just cracked.

Avoid this one!"
2.0,"We just burned up our third one of these, this one just slightly out of the warranty period.  We love it, but we will be looking for something a little more durable..."
1.0,"I have less than a 1/3 acre lot, so I figured this should be adequate since the box says for up to 1/2 acre.  The goods:  well built, string feed seems to work well.  No need for power cord, gas.  No battery memory (claimed)  Quiet, no exhaust.  The bad:  I'm 6 feet tall and find the handling real ackward.  The battery last less than 15 min on a full charge.  I do light trimming and edging and I find that I can only do 1/3 of my 9000 square feet lawn with each charge.  A two hour recharge bought me another 5-7 minutes.  The narrow 12"" cutting path exacerbates the problem since sometimes I have to make 2 passes to finish the job.  There is not enough power to cut tall (6"" or more) grass.  I returned mine and bought a gas powered, which I'm much happier with.  If you live in an arid area where grass never gets real tall, and your lot is very small, this may be perfect.  The reason for 1 star is that it is not appropriate for lot size anywhere near 1/2 acre as stated right on the box."
5.0,"It has plenty of power, it does a nice job in both edging and trimming.  I really like the wire bale that you can flip over the cutting head to align the string when you are edging.  It makes it easy to keep a straight line going.  This is all that I hoped for when I ordered it."
1.0,I owned this Grass Hog for about 6 months. I had nothing but problems with it. The battery was so hard to remove from the shaft of the Grass Hog. It almost took me the same amount of time trying to remove the rechargable battery then it did to trim the lawn. After 6 months the battery would no longer charge. What a piece of crap.
5.0,"My husband is in the military and is gone for extended periods at a time.  He has a gas weed trimmer that is very diffictult to turn on and very heavy.  I am very pleased with the performance of this trimmer.  It is very easy to turn on, and I don't have to mess with gas or oil.  It is also lightweight and came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  I used it for about 30 minutes and was able to trim my small yard and edge a nice border around the porch. My husband said he'll be using this trimmer when he gets back instead of his gas one."
5.0,"We have only had gas weed eaters before and they worked fine - if you could turn them on.  My husband is in the military and gone a lot so when the last gas weed eater broke, I picked this weed eater out.  I am so glad I chose this one.  It is very light even when I am nine months pregnant I don't get tired carrying it around.  It is very easy to turn from a weed eater to an edger.  It required no tools to do - just pull on the end and turn.  Mine came with 2 batteries which is handy even though each battery lasts around 40 minutes.  I don't have huge weeds or branches to trim, just normal grass and a dandelion here and there but I have accidentally cut down a strawberry plant so it's powerful enough to do that.  I can easily replace the spool of string without help when it runs out.  I think it's just the greatest weed eater out there."
1.0,"This is the biggest piece of junk we've ever waster 80 dollars on. The string rarely feeds out on it's own, you have to constantly tip the unit up and manually pull the string out. The motor lacks sufficient rpm's to cut even modest weeds. The battery does not hold sufficient charge to do a resonably sized yard. It went in the trash can and we wrote the 80 bucks off as a learning expereience.

We learned not to buy Black and Decker."
5.0,"I bought one of these about 7 years ago, This is the best trimmer I have ever used. Powerful, 12"" cut, edger, and easy to hold and use. I have a large city lot, with many gardens, climbers, trees and out buildings. It does them all, and there is still power left. Put it back into the handing wall hanger charger, and away you go. I bought this as a replacement as the battery on my old one is starting to not hold a charge as well as it did, but it still works like the day I got it. My father in law just trashed his gas one for this trimmer. No:oil, gas, plugs, pull start and finiky temperment of a gas trimmer and it's just a powerful and much easier to use. A1 gardening item and a must! Highly recommended."
5.0,"I bought my Grass Hog in 2000 and finally this spring it died.  The battery wouldn't recharge.  I found out where to order another one in another post (Dewalt Factory Service, online).  That battery wouldn't recharge either, so I returned it to my local Service Center and they exchanged it, after asking if I had brought along the charger, too.  The new battery wouldn't recharge, so I took it back to the Service Center along with the charger.  The problem was my charger, not my battery.  The gentlemen there gave me other tips which will probably keep my Grass Hog going for another 5 years.  Store it inside in the winter.  Inside does not mean in the garage, because that can still be cold enough to freeze the battery.  I was lucky because I have an attached garage (slightly warmer) and I kept my Grass Hog on the charger all winter even though I wasn't using it.  If you need to take it in for service, take the charger as well as the battery."
3.0,"I have a B & D cordless moewer, cordless hedge trimmer and other power tools.  They all have worked to my expectations.. EXCEPT the GRASS HOG'S battery charger.  The trimmer seems to be fine.. but the charger doesn't work properly.  The problem is not the battery, but the charger itself.  I can't seem to find anyone who carries the charger in the Georgetown, Tx. area.  I can't even get Home Depot to replace the charger.  I would like to know a good brand name cordless trimmer/edger that is more reliable."
2.0,"I don't like the B&D Grass Hog.  It is uncomfortable to use, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, because you can't lock the power switch into the ""on"" position.  You have to grip the lower switch with your 2nd through 5th fingers while simultaneously exerting heavy pressure on the upper switch with your thumb.  After 10 minutes of this, I get serious pain in my hand and the muscles in my wrist.  (I have the same problem with a B&D electric saw.)  The battery doesn't last long, runs out after 15 to 20 minutes.  The trimmer doesn't work well with tall grass.  There are only two advantages:  the trimmer has an automatic feed, no bumping needed, and it's electric, so you don't have to store cans of gasoline in your basement.  But all in all, it's easier (and cheaper) to trim grass and weeds the old-fashioned way, using hand clippers."
1.0,If you live on the 43rd floor this is the trimmer for you!
1.0,"We loved this trimmer. Lightweight, easy to manuever, no bumping or cutting to get line! Our yard is fairly small, so the charge was plenty to finish the job. HOWEVER, this - our third year - it was not holding a charge. I called B&D - that's just what happens. WHAT? A new battery pack is about $30-35. A new corded model ST-4000 is about $35.00. They should make you aware that you will be either buying new batteries or replacing the unit every three-four years. OUCH!

FOLLOW-UP: It appears it may have been a little cold in the garage for the battery. We got a new one, stored it in the basement instead and it has held up much better."
5.0,"I'm on my second season with this edger and, so far, no problems.  I have .3 acres on a corner lot.  That's a lot of sidewalks and fenceing to edge.  If I do the entire yard in one day, the battery does run down, but I get most of the yard done.  Typically, I do the front yard one day and the back yard another day (mow and edge) just because it's a lot of work for this old girl.  I'm not getting any younger.  When I split the work up this way, my edger and matching cordless lawnmower handle the load quite well.  Hopefully, I'll continue to get good service."
5.0,We have a small yard and this works great for our needs. We're in our second season and so far the battery has given us no problems. It is so nice to not have to bump the line or deal with a cord. I am a woman and have no problems carrying the weight except sometimes when I am edging and have hold it at a weird angle.
1.0,"Exactly two weeks ago today I purchased the B&D Grass Hog from Home Depot, one of the mega home improvement complexes.  My gardener was AWOL for the previous month so I decided to finally purchase the equipment to perform yardwork myself.  The ""hog"" appeared to be a sound product.  It was environmentally friendly, lightweight, and could clear ""up to 1/4 acre on a single maximum 12 hour charge"" according to the enclosed instructions.  (Oddly, somewhere else in the package it stated that charging could take ""up to 16 hours."")  Furthermore, on the day of purchase, there was a B&D representative who was advising Home Depot customers.  I talked to him for 10 minutes about my needs.  He assured me that the hog was more than adequate because my whole lot was substantially less than 1/4 acre.  I charged the hog for 18 hours before the initial use.  The battery pack was heavier than anticipated and I finally got over the awkwardness of attaching the battery to the trimmer.  (The handle of the battery pack is designed for someone with large hands.)  I started by testing the hog on the backyard.  I was amazed that after cutting for 10 minutes, the hog still had a charge but the power was so weak that it was basically massaging, not cutting, the weeds!  I had only managed to trim an area of weeds of about 100 sq. feet, a far cry from 1/4 acre.  I put the hog back on its charger, re-read the instructions and specs, and wondered what I had failed to do.  I called B&D customer service at 2:10 p.m. on Friday afternoon to ask if 10 minutes was the normal running time for the hog.  Unfortunately, customer service closed at 5 p.m. EST.  I let the battery charge over the weekend.  On Monday I got the same 10 minute run time.  I believe it is false/misleading to advertise the ""1/4 acre"" capability without informing the public that the hog will need a 12 to 16 hour recharge after 10 minutes of use, and therefore it will take several days to trim 1/4 acre.  The hog is suited only for a very small area, not any serious yard work.  Of course, Home Depot has a no refund policy and probably a restocking charge.  I'm about to find out:  I'm on my way to return the ""B&D Grass Hog.""  I'm gonna buy a good old, reliable, environmentally unfriendly gas trimmer.  B & D should be required by law to inform customers somewhere on the box or in the literature that the hog only works for 10 minutes after which it is utterly useless for a day.  It spends exponentially more time ""charging"" than in actual use."
3.0,"Four years have gone by and the motor died.  The battery would last about 10 minutes and that's it.  I plan on buying the new 18 volt model and will try the other person from Austin recommendation, charge indoors.  This trimmer will not do an entire yard at once so if that is your mission look elsewhere.  I plan to get the new one because it's emission free.  The foul emissions from my borrowed gas trimmer is sickening.  The construction design could definitely be better."
5.0,As described and working great. No issues.
1.0,Has not worked since the day I purchased it.  Tried numerous extension cords and plugs.  Waited too long to return it so I'm stuck with a piece of junk that does not work.
1.0,Arrived with a cut power cord in the box. Poor quality control.
5.0,Loved It!
3.0,"Product works, but not the easiest to handle"
4.0,A great machine. really does the job yery well on our sidewalks on a corner lot
1.0,Another machine that doesn't work. It won't come on. That's my 3 rd machine that doesn't work.
4.0,"I haven't used this rig, but the wife has used it around the garden to do edging and she says it works fine.....so there you go."
5.0,I was surprised it had an excess of power.  I trenched in an ethernet cable and then edged my driveway.  I was impressed with it.
5.0,Makes my pad look like a million bucks.  I wish I bought this edger years ago.
1.0,"It could be that I just got a lemon, but I bought one of these from my local home store soon after I purchased my house, after all, every homeowner needs a good weed whacker.  Well, this turned out to be anything but.  The auto line feeder jammed several times and the battery ran out after only a few minutes (ten, give or take).  There was thing in the manual from B&D to contact them if I experienced any problems before returning it, so I did, explained the problem, and they did...  nothing.  They said their warentee doesn't cover the line feeder or the battery.  I didn't see this on the actual card in the box, but I didn't feel like arguing the point with some CS rep when I could spend that time driving back to my local home store and returning the hunk of junk.  All this was after a total of two uses.  The return clerk at the store said I wasn't the first person to return this product after only a couple uses, and they were considering removing it from their shelves.  Anyway, as always, you're milage may vary."
2.0,"The yearly ritual around our house for the backyard garden is to trim and weed out the overgrowth that magically appears every springtime. We have had gardeners do the job, but this was not looking looking too good since it was costing quite a bit when we totalled the yearly maintainance fees. I wanted a weeder/trimmer that was non-gasoline powered and cordless too. I saw the B&D Grass Hog and bought one, in hopes that this would save us some money. The set-up of the unit is easy. A few screws, charge up the battery, (it will take overnight) and you are good to go. The first thing that you will notice is that it is pretty heavy for a trimmer/weed whacker. This is due to the heavy lead-acid battery that is perched at the top of the unit. The second thing that is noticed is it's power. I was able to whack and trim the heaviest grasses and weeds. The big problem is the extremely short usage time per charge. I was only able to use the Grass Hog continuously for only about 12 to 15 minutes before it ran down and stopped working. This is not acceptable. In fact, it is a down right failure for usefulness as far as a garden tool. I cannot perceive why Black and Decker would even market and sell this item because the effective run time is so low. I am returning this unit. In the meanwhile, I have discovered that other cordless trimmers last up to 40 minutes for about the same price as the Black and Decker. If this was a final exam for the cordless Grass Hog, it would receive a grade of D."
1.0,"We bought this trimmer at a home improvement store (Home Depot/Lowes/etc) because of high praise from the Black&Decker rep who was working there. I'm sad to say that it failed in practically every aspect -- the charge ran out much too quickly, it didn't have enough power to do a decent job when it was charged up, the auto-feed didn't work well for us at all... I guess the only good thing about it was that it was light-weight and quiet. We returned it after several attempts to get accustomed to it and bought a real product."
4.0,"It's convenient, not that heavy and doesn't pollute. Perfect for the smaller yard.  Keep your receipt, however, so you can be sure your warranty is valid.  The last Black & Decker trimmer I had, the cylinder holding the timming line broke off the drive and could not be repaired.  I didn't have a slip, and even though it was still under warranty, I had to trash it and buy a new one."
4.0,"I bought this trimmer because I wanted a quieter alternative to a gas engine. It is well balanced, especially with the angle adjustable handle. I use this primarily for trimming grass along my backyard fence and it does a reasonably good job and no battery rundown problems. As mentioned in other reviews, the auto-feed is balky. As you trim, it begins to ""fade."" Then suddenly it's back to full trimming. Once you get used to it, it's a tolerable trade-off. The wall-mount storage holder/charger is great. The charger has lights to indicate charging status."
2.0,"The trimmer works for about 20-25 minutes before losing its charge, which is o.k. for me because I have a small yard.  What isn't o.k. is that the plastic cap that holds the string in place is really thin and cheaply made.  Mine broke after only one bump against a rock, and now I can't find a replacement part.  I'd pay more for better construction, and ease of finding replacement parts."
4.0,"I have a normal suburban sized home and yard--nothing outrageous.  If my edging is normal to light, the battery lasts all the way to the end (less than 30-40 minutes).  If I've not edged in a while, then it runs out before I am done (more than 35 minutes or so).  Not a big deal--just know the limitations.  The weight is not too heavy for me or my wife to easily carry.  The power is definitely down from a gas string trimmer, slightly down from a normal corded electric.  That said, it still gets the job done very nicely.
One of the prime reasons I bought this trimmer was the automatic feed spool system.  I am glad to say it works as advertised--you never have to mess with it.  With the power output and the AFS, I actually find that I use less string than with previous trimmers--nice benefit.
I really was frustrated with other trimmers with bump n' go string methods.  Refilling the darn spool manually was just a royal pain.  If you are like that, and can live with the time and power limitations, this is the trimmer for you."
4.0,"I bought the CST2000 after reading the numerous customer reviews. Overall, the Trimmer/Edger works as advertised as long as you follow the directions! The ""Green"" Battery-powered format coupled with the Auto-Line Feed are it's best features.
A few areas that B&D need to do better include:
1- The multi-language user's guide has usefull advice but they are difficult to find in all the gobbly-gook.
2- The Battery does NOT like to be charged in my 110 F Austin TX Garage. (The battery module has a note recommending that it be charged indoors). I first charged the battery in my garage for 20 hours and found that the battery only lasted about half as long as subsequent charges indoors. A KW-Hr Meter confirmed that the high ambient temperature charging was about 50% of optimum. (Also, the sealed Lead Acid battery probably will not survive very long with continuous trickle charging at high ambient temperatures).
3- The factory-installed spool failed to auto-feed at first. After loosening the string by unwinding/winding about 2 feet, it worked fine."
5.0,"WELL 2 YEARS AFTER BUYING THIS TRIMMER, I HIT A METAL DOG LEAD
AND MY TRIMMER JUST WASN'T CUTTING GRASS...SOMETHING BROKE ON IT. I CONTACTED BLACK AND DECKER. THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO A LOCAL SERVICE SHOP, ABOUT 15 MIN DRIVE FROM WHERE I LIVE. I TURNED IN THE OLD ONE, PAID $10 FOR SHIPPING AND RECEIVED A BRAND NEW ONE 2-3 WEEKS LATER. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT...THANK YOU BLACK & DECKER!!!"
1.0,"I own a number of black and decker rechargeable tools and have been satisfied.  I purchased this trimmer and was so disappointed!  The power was POOR and didn't last very long even with a freshly charged battery.  It was like when I just touched grass with it, the speed slowed and it really didn't cut the grass.  I'm sorry I threw out the box because I'd love to take it back!!!!  Boo Black and Decker!  You can do so much better than this!"
3.0,"I bought this last year off amazon.com and just got around to using it today.  it was easy as pie to set up and get running, and did a good job of trimming down my weeds.  it doesn't cut thru anything thicker than your tallest weed though - and the battery life did not last long at all.  but still, not bad for what i paid for it."
1.0,"The biggest drawback is the charge only lasts 25 to 30 minutes! The auto line feeder is great, it is nice not to have a cord or have to mix gas and oil, it is balanced well and lightweight, works well at cutting back weeds but the charge doesn't last very long.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have a large area to cut weeds in. For small yards it is fine. It takes a long time to recharge also, at least 6 hours and they recommend 12 hours. I have used it about 6 times and each time I charged it overnight and it still only lasted 25 to 30 minutes."
5.0,I use this trimmer alot and I find that it is very good. The battery takes an hour to recharge and holds a charge. The trimmer is very strong and cuts large weeds and tall grass. I live in the country and this comes in very handy just grab it and go to work!
4.0,"My 2nd review! After using this trimmer 6 times, I bought an
extra battery for it, $...-and now have more than enough battery
power for my yard, plus! I use it to trim the grave markers in
the family plot. one word-If the self feed does not work properly
try bump feeding it lightly on the ground, this should allow
new line to extend."
4.0,"Finally a way to trim weeds without the hassle! I have a fairly big yard and I was able to trim the whole thing (along fences, flower beds, bushes and trees) on one battery charge. I love the AFS. I had a bump to feed in the past and could never get it to work! Not to mention the 3000ft extention cord that made trimming a mess! I also had gas trimmers and hated the smell! The only drawback with this trimmer is the weight. It's a little bit heavy and bulky. Other than that ...I really like it."
3.0,"I know that cordless trimmers have to have some compromises.  If they make it as powerful as a gas model or run all day it would be too heavy to carry.  If they make it small and light than it won't have enough power or capacity to do the job.  This trimmer has adequate power (barely) and allows you to trim and edge a small yard without being too heavy to carry.
Like other reviewers I find the automatic line feed to be balky.  To be fair I also had problems with other trimmers with this feature so I don't think any of them are perfect.  At first I had trouble with the edging feature but once I got the hang of it I can do almost as good a job edging with this trimmer as I used to do with my dedicated edger.
This is a good unit as long as you are willing to put up with the compromises necessary to make it cordless and electric.  If you need a lot of power or need to do a large lot it is no replacement for a gas trimmer."
4.0,"A great grandmother, living alone on a small acreage, I trimmed with a pair of shears because I could NOT start the small motors on a gas trimmer.  The cords for electric trimmers were not long enough. I searched for several years and with the advent of the internet found the Black and Decker battery trimmer.  What a handsome tool and it worked tirelessly. The Grass Hog takes the place of any man(smile, smile). Today, I am ordering another because(I was told) the end plug will not permit the battery on the two-year old Grass Hog to regenerate. Hopefully,using a new end plug will clear up the problem. Having two Grass Hogs will just add to my ability to trim at my leisure.  Thank you Black and Decker from all the ""older women"" who do their own yard work at the young age of 68. PS: I could not find a new end plug under accessories."
3.0,"this is the first trimmer/edger i've actually owned, usually just borrowed one.
good points: easy to put together (instructions still in plastic bag). easy transition from trimmer to edger. cordless freedom is great ,sure beats messing around with gas or tangled extention cords.
bad points: battery life is not that great, when weak it looks like its just playing with the grass. wish it had two strings instead of one. plastic parts could be better quality, although i havn't any problems yet."
4.0,"I got my cordless Grass Hog three years ago.  The first two summers were great, not having to deal with messy gasoline or electric cords.  Unfortunately, when I got the unit out this spring, the battery would not charge up properly.  While at first I could do my entire yard and fenceline on one charge, now I can only go about 50 feet.  I am still considering buying another one, however, because it did work pretty well for awhile."
5.0,works great
4.0,"Tried it as soon as I got it - be aware - the directions have about 8 steps with pictures - (very simple steps) however - picture 4 was missing and I was not sure how to reverse the handle.  The written directions for this step are not very descriptive and it even states ""see picture""  but there is not picture.

It worked really well.  I have about a 200' or longer driveway and about a 40' walkway to the front door.  I have not edged in a couple of years (I have 2 acres and mowing alone is a lot of time).  You can imagine how much overgrown tough, long, and thick blades of grass I have.  It cut right through most of it on the first pass.  A few spots I needed a second pass - but that is my fault for not keeping up with it."
5.0,"works great, thank you"
5.0,I used this to run a new invisible fence for my .75acre yard. This made the perfect sized ditch and saved me a ton of time verses digging the small trench myself.
5.0,works as expected when arrived
4.0,Great Product
5.0,It works like it supposed to. Easy to adjust to the depth of the cut you need. Plenty of power. Id recommend it if you're looking for an edger.
5.0,Well made and works well.
5.0,Gets the job done.
5.0,Perfect for giving my gardens a more manicured look.  I have a landscaper but he uses a sting cutter and does not get that grooved edging that I prefer. Easy to use on my St. Augustine grass.
5.0,"For a small edger it works perfect for me, easy to handle."
5.0,good
3.0,Hard to navigate
3.0,Does not work quite as good as I wanted
5.0,"Works excellent on sidewalk and driveway, making the yard look very nice"
5.0,Bought it as a Christmas gift to my husband and he loved it!!!
5.0,"I have a lot of curb and driveway to edge.  After years of fighting weed eaters, I definitely like this even if it has a electric cord.  No more messing with gasoline motors.  I had allowed the grass to grow long onto the driveway so the first time was time consuming.  Edged on a frequent basis, the edger gives a good quick clean cut.  The edger has good power.  I am happy with the purchase."
5.0,Great Product!
5.0,An excellent product and terrific service.
5.0,Does a great job for such a inexpensive  item.
3.0,"First the good news on this product.  1) Its very easy to start.  Just pull the trigger and its running.  No cords to pull or chokes to set  2)  There is no need to buy fuel and then mix oil into it.  3)  The machine does not emit emissions.
Next are my concerns:  1)  With only a single string, the machine has a hard time cutting compared with machines that have two stings.  2)  The battery really does not last very long.  Half an hour at most.  3)  The quality of the product appears to be typical of other Black and Decker products that I have had.  I trust that if I do not push this machine too hard it will work fine.  It is not a big job machine.  It should be good for small home projects.
All of that said,  I have reasonbly happy with my new machine.  I believe that I will need to use it more frequently to keep up on the trimming around my yard.  However, since it starts so easily and never needs fuel, I will be certain that it will start every week.
 I would say that my lot is about 10,000 sq feet and that if all I do is trim the small front and back laws I should be able to finish within one charge.  Note that it seems to be harder to trim with only one string and hence I have found that it takes me longer to get the job done.  I am hopeful that as I use the tool more I will get better at it.
The trimmer does not seem to have enough juice to trim the lawns and then the area next to the two strees above and below my house."
4.0,"I've now had mine for 2 years and found it to be better than I'd hoped for.  I did not give it 5 stars because it could use a little more power when trying to cut through crab grass, but for most jobs, it is a joy to use.  It feeds the line as needed and since I have it hanging on the charge stand, it is always ready.  As a matter of fact, I only charge it once every 2 times around the house.  It is a lot quieter than a gas trimmer, so I can start out early in the morning when it is still cool outside.  It is very sturdy and looks like it can and will last a long time.  I'd say, it delivers more that it promises... a good buy!"
4.0,"This is a wonderful tool. Its predecessor was an earlier (B&D) model of the same trimmer. It received heavy use and never gave anything but satisfaction. The reason this current model only gets four stars (instead of five) from me is because of the difficulty I had attaching the guard. It took two days of intermittent fiddling before I figured out the right combination of angle and pressure, etc., and I work in a hardware store!"
1.0,"At first, I loved this trimmer. The auto feed worked and the battery lasted long enough to do the yard. First the auto feed started sticking so that I would have to open the spool and pull the line out manually. The parts are made of cheap plastic so that they wear out and break easily. Then the battery started wearing out so that I would have to recharge after going 1/2 way around the driveway. Finally the spool started just spilling out line with nothing to hold it in place. A huge disappointment. B&D makes parts out of very cheap plastic."
4.0,"Everything about this trimmer is superior to the corded model I used to use.  The battery provides sufficient power to handle most tasks.  The only complaint I have is assembly, which consists of installing the guard at the business end of the trimmer.  The guard attaches via 3 Phillips screws.  Upon attempting to screw them in, I found them far too tight to pass through the guard.  I resorted to adding beeswax to the threads and using a pair of pliars in order to be able to turn the 3 screws."
4.0,"I just bought this item about a month ago. I did not want anything gas powered, and I thought an electric trimmer would be too inconvenient. So far, I love it! It has a wide cutting swath, so it makes quick work of your trimming. It is also an excellent edger. Word of warning-if your edging is overgrown, as mine was when I bought this tool, it may not do a good job. I had someone do my lawn for me while on vacation, and now it works great. It is so easy to use, just push the button down and pull the trigger to start. You can shut it off, and turn it back on, as often as you need. It charges quickly. I was even able to trim my entire yard on just a 2 hour charge when I first purchased it. However, I usually do one task, say edging, charge it a while, then go back and trim.
The only drawback to this item is the weight. It is very top heavy due to the battery. I would not recommend it to anyone with weak upper arms or limited arm strength. It does build biceps, so on the days I use it I don't work out.
In summary, works great for a small yard, is convenient and easy to use, does a great job at edging, but it is heavy."
3.0,"The first year I had this trimmer it worked great on my 80x120 foot lot. The second year it started to lose all it's power by the fourth or fifth trimming. After ""playing"" with the local B&D service center I took matters into my own hands. I discovered after taking the battery pack apart that the sealed lead acid (SLA) battery was made by Panasonic. I found a source for the battery on the web and ordered a replacement. It worked great until the following year. I then realized it was the cheap charger that B&D furnishes that was causing the problem. I ordered a [price] automatic charger from my internet battery source.
No more battery or charging problems! I'm back to enjoying using the trimmer again."
1.0,"Absolute junk.  AFS system does not work.  I have to manually refeed the line.  I have not had the patience to complete edging my yard during the course of a single day because I spend greater than 50% time popping off the spool cap and manually refeeding the line.  It takes about an hour to edge 150 feet, because the line breaks and needs to be manually refed every 1 to 3 minutes.  Please don't buy this."
4.0,"OK, I'm not going to go ""hog"" wild over how cool this little gadget is.  My parents have one and I consider it just OK.  Sure, it works well enough and everything, but how much fun is it to do yardwork?...  Getting it done quickly is pretty much my bottom line and this helps it along well enough.  Not as well as hiring a professional groundskeeper, but if you gotta do it you gotta do it.  Anyway, unquestionably the best part of this gadget is it's name.  The Grass Hog.  After my dad's birthday last month, I secretly threw the opened box away by tossing it into the back seat of my Saturn.  That box is like a trophy.  I'm still ponidering how I can somehow turn it into a pipe."
1.0,"When i initially recieved this trimmer I really liked it.  The versitility of a cordless edger/trimmer was great for doing the whole yard without the hassle of 'dragging a tail'.  It's spooling feature of releasing more cord by tapping it on the ground also is a wonderful feature.
However..
I just bought this last May(2001) and already the battery is too weak to make it more than 40 feet around my yard(May 2002).  This equates to a 4 day edging adventure to get the whole yard done since you must recharge the battery overnight.  If I had to do it all over again I would go for a gas powered trimmer or one with a cord.
Avoid this item."
4.0,"This trimmer is fantastic if you cut your grass just as it's drying.  If you try to cut green grass,  the battery fades before it's supposed to.
However,  the line feed on my unit doesn't work correctly,  which may be why the cutting time isn't what it's supposed to be (the line only feeds about half way out to the shield,  which means I'm getting much less cutting action than I should be).
I recommend everything about this trimmer,  except for the ""automatic"" line feed...."
5.0,"Finally, a cordless electric trimmer that can really do the job.
The electric motor is plenty powerful, and the battery life is more than enough to handle a whole yard on one charge (I live on a large lot, and use my trimmer extensively). You no longer have to deal with cords (or all the unpleasantness of gasoline engines.)
But just as impressive is the general usability of the unit. The head flips from ""trimmer"" mode to ""edger"" mode with an easy twist. In either mode, the heft and balance are wonderful, and there's a minimum of effort in using it. The automatic string feeder works great.
For most homeowners, I'd recommend giving this trimmer a close look."
5.0,"I can't believe it took them this long to come out with this product! Living on an acre, I've had to drag out a mile of cord to use a corded trimmer that eventually died. So I bought a 2 stroke. That was great for cutting down the brush, edging, etc. But that was so noisy!
Then, I saw and ad for this Grass Hog....had to try it!
This thing does 99% of my trimming! No cords, no bumping the spool..just walk and trim! I make it around my entire property on a single charge...and I can do my triming early since its so quiet! I still use my 2 stroke for the heavier brush occasionally, but this Grass Hog has won the contest hands down!
You won't be dissapointed in this trimmer! And your neighbors will love the lack of noise it produces!"
5.0,"I love this trimmer! I can go places I couldn't go before, I have a very large yard and even with two very long extension cords hooked together (this is a mess, going around trees, fences, flower bed borders, etc.) I couldn't get to all the places I needed to get to. No cords to untangle & unwrap from around faucets, rocks, etc. A blessing! Plenty of power to get my job done, too. As for the weight, I'm a 70-year old female and didn't have a bit of trouble with that aspect. Another plus: the shield on this trimmer keeps all the grass from collecting all over your shoes, your pants & your legs! I used to have to sweep myself off before I could go back into the house. But not with this trimmer. Very well designed. This last trip out in the yard I lost a part that holds the handle on, I'm hoping Customer Service will help me get a replacement. And I've not replaced the string yet, don't know how that will go. As great as this trimmer is, tho, it should be easy to do."
3.0,"I bought this after spending 30 minutes this spring trying to get my gas fired unit running. After it was running, I discovered it was out of string. I was out of patience, so I thought I would try this unit.
I found it to be heavier than I expected and was a little disappointed at the weight. You don't want to work for any amount of time using this. I also found the recharging system to be a little difficult to use unless you want to use the wall mount.
The unit works well, but lacks the power found in either gas powered or corded units. This works both for and against it. It does not tend to shred tree bark if you get to close, but it does have trouble on anything other than average weeds and grass.
I have also found it is a poor substitute for an edger. It really doesn't work well for that purpose.
To sum up, I think this would be great if you live in a townhouse or have a small property with only a minimal amount of trimming to do. On larger properties, stick with gas or corded!"
2.0,"The Black and Decker CST 2000 Grass Hog is easy to use, is light, and cuts great. However, the maximum amount of cutting time per use was only about 20 minutes. The company advertises up to 40 minutes, but after 20 minutes the power decreased to about half, and the trimmer could not cut a blade of grass. For a small yard, where 20 minutes is all you need, this would be an ideal product."
5.0,"I have absolutely no complaints after my first couple uses.  I eagerly look forward to my weeds growing just so I can ""Grass Hog"" them down!  Perfect for my approx. 2,000 sq. ft. backyard trimming and edging.  My stepping stones never looked better!"
5.0,"This trimmer is an excellent choice for the average homeowner.  I have had mine for about 6 months.  It's the perfect combo of power, ease of use, and weight.  It is a little heavier than a corded electric because of the battery, but it is much lighter than a gas powered.  The auto feed spool makes it very easy to use even though you will use more line that you would with a bump feed model.  For me, it's well worth the wasted line not to have to worry about ""pulling"" more line.  I haven't had any mechanical problems at all, and the spool was easy to change.  Buy a 3 pack spool replacement package when you buy it.  The most persuasive agrument I can give you is that my wife loves using it, and she is really, really picky.  If you are weed wacking a 3 acre farm or weeds that 2 feet tall, this is not the choice for you, but I have found that I trim much more often becuase it is soo easy to start using and put away.  Consequently, the weeds never get a chance to get very tall."
5.0,"I love this tool.  My first one died after several years of hard work and can't find anything else I liked better than this one. This will cut such a nice edge it really makes a difference along with your sidewalks, walkways, and driveway.  This will definitely enhance curb appeal to your lawn."
5.0,Works GREAT!  No problem with the cord at all.
3.0,It does what it should.  Due to the plastic wheel(s) sometimes gets stuck on a split in the sidewalk.  It does clog up quickly if the ground is remotely wet.
5.0,"Powerful motor, great torque. Makes edging easy."
4.0,"This is my third Black&Decker electric lawn edger...each previous one lasted about 4 yrs and I've been told that's about average.  Researched other brands of electric edgers but always come back to this one.  I like this one best--this new model is an improvement over the last one...seems to be more powerful and easier to maneuver.  I'm a 70 yr old female & still mow/edge my lawn here in central Florida.  Edging is a necessity for a nice looking landscape and my property has lots of sculpted areas that require edging.  Using this edger & a 100 ft electric cord, I have no problem taking care of it all and always get compliments from neighbors about my lawn.  Gave it only 4 stars because I wish these edgers would last longer."
2.0,"Not a very usable item.  You can only run it one direction , and only with grass to,the right ... very poor quality"
4.0,Make sure the nut on the blade is tight... it came loose on me at first.  Once I got that sorted it did a good job for a little electric machine.  Did flower beds and a walkway no problem.
5.0,This is easy to use and makes the lawn look much better than just mowing it.
5.0,Thank You!
5.0,My husband is very happy with this product.  It was a good price and arrived quickly.
1.0,"I am glad to hear some people are have positive experiences with their units.  As for mine, there is a serious problem with the line feed and string cutter.  I have been hit three times in the leg with excessive string that was feed out and then finally broke off. The piece then flew back and hit me in the right leg.  B&D sent me a new guard and cutter, but same old problem.  I did a quick web search found that I was not the only one who had the feed and cutting problem, although I was the only one to mention taking a hit on the leg.  This problem concerned me enought to email the Consumers Product Safety Commision.  So, I will be trying to return this model."
3.0,"I have tried mine two times. Tomorrow the 3rd. Observed that there is not enough power to cut thru the St. Augustine Flortam grass I have in Florida, that resembles crab grass up north. I wonder if it is the line. Is it too thin or not dense enough? Before the auto feed puts out a new edge you are using a woren down edge and too short to be effective. Black and Decker is sending me a sample of line as I feel the .065 that came with the unit is not really that size. I can't believe they put that thin a line in the machine. I matched my units line with bulk in Home Depot and the stock line looks thicker. Any similar problems e-mail me at clarkjudy@hitter.net  as I an considering taking mine back for a Ryobi 155R 12-volt cordless, if I can find one in stock somewhere."
4.0,"Black and Decker has really done it with this cordless trimmer.  I can't count how many people who were staring at me wondering what I was doing while I trimmed my yard with a edger that was quiet and needed no electric cord. I know the first thing you are thinking is that there cannot be enough juice to do the job but there is.  However, this unit is a great trimmer but horrible edger unless you really don't mind how your lawn looks as long as its cut.  You cannot get that great looking trench look with this trimmer/edger like you can with a solid electric or gas edger.  But when it comes to eatin up weeds it will do the trick.  I found it works very well with yards that are kept up and not neglected.  If you are one of those people who lets their yard go and looking like a rainforest before cutting it down, then you will get very frustrated with this trimmer.  Rainforest yard keepers, you are better off with a gas trimmer.  One tip that I have found is to take bursts of power on the trimmer instead of holding the trigger down for long periods of time.  Excessive trigger holds will heat up the battery and decrease your charge quicker.  All-in-all this is a very nice trimmer that will attack just about any yard.  But if you desire that well trimmed, trenched cut edge for your yard then you are better off going with a solid edger."
5.0,"After years of lugging extension cords and recognizing the futility of gas  trimmers, I finally found the best of all worlds.  This trimmer lived up to  the hype.  I trimmed my half-acre lot the first use, and it made it (no  power to spare, though).  The trimmer isn't light, although it's  well-balanced.  I prefer it heavier for better control in sweeping motion.  The battery pack is somewhat clumsy to remove; it hangs on the wall nicely  in the recharger unit.  Definite recommendation here."
1.0,"What a major disappointment this baby is.  I got about half way done with  my 1/2 acre yard before running out of juice.  I could have put up with the  fact that this guy is heavy & you have to wait 24 hours to charge it up  again if it can't finish the job, but it didn't cut very well either.  This  could have been a great product. The automatic line feeder works great.  When someone comes up with a unit that has auto line feed, works well and  gives you freedom from an extension cord, I'll buy it. This unit is not it.  The cheaper electric unit works much better at half the price."
1.0,"The box on the Black & Decker cordless trimmer says the battery will  last for 1/2 an acre.  This is a useless claim.  Is that a 1/2 acre with no  trees, fences, curbs, or sidewalks?
They should instead tell you how  many linear feet it can cut on one battery charge on average.  But I  suppose if they did this no one would buy it.
I feel we have an average  size lawn but this string trimmer could not do but half of it before it ran  out of juice.  To make matters worse it has so little power that it at  times did not even have enough power to cut the grass.  It would instead  just ""whip"" the grass repeatedly until it fell limp against the  ground.  The Automatic Feed Spool has a blade that cuts the line if it gets  to long.  It rarely had enough power to cut it's own line.
We attempted  to use this string trimmer 3 times before we got frustrated and took it  back.  We now have the corded version of this same product.  It is an  excellent product."
5.0,"I tried the trimmer out for the first time on 8-3-00. It worked great. I have about 300 feet of chain link fence, it never missed a beat. I edged the  sidewalks and trimmed around the house and rose gardens. It is so nice not  to have to  fight cords. It runs better than my regular weed eater. I ran  it steady for an hour, it never shown signs of giving up."
5.0,"Just thought for the folks who like gas trimmers, this little guy does it all. I feel it is light enough. May not be as powerful as a gas trimmer but it will cut through just about any grass I cut in my yard. Did pretty good  on some long and tall weeds around my fence. I run it for about 45 minutes.  Never had any problem with the battery. I like the fact that this company  finally included a battery that will not hold memory. You can keep this  battery on charge all of the time. Thanks for a product that really works.  Excellent!  Two year warrenty. Not 90 days."
5.0,"Real short & sweet:
I have used this trimmer for 3 weeks and I can tell you its well worth the money!  It has plenty of power and the auto feed seems to work just fine.  The only down side is that it is a bit heavy  (about the same as a good sized electric trimmer).  Sure beats getting out  the extension cords.  I would recomend to anyone."
5.0,"I really didn't think the Black & Decker would be as good as the Craftsman edger that it was replacing, but it was actually better.  It was more powerful and it had several features the Craftsman didn't have.  I paid attention to the good reviews and bought it and am happy I did.  'Course, I've only used it one time so I can't speak about its durability.  The Craftsman lasted about 10 years."
5.0,Well built and works great! We have a B&D company in my town and I know that it will last along time. I have used it many times and it has not failed me. Good buy.
4.0,"Works great.  I have St. Augustine, so lots of runner to work through. I bought it to replace a Sears version.  I didn't think to check and see if you could open the cover to dig out mud.  You could open my previous one.  You can't on this one.  But still I'm overall happy."
5.0,works great.  It does a fine job of edging.
5.0,Does a great job and durable.
5.0,Very satisfied with the item. Does an excellent job as a lawn edger.
5.0,"I bought this in early summer because I wanted clean edges on the lawn, and needed to 'dig' a small trench line so my husband and I could do a bit of edging to prevent the grass from growing into our rose garden.  This thing is great.  Although I did a video / took some pictures right away when we used it - unfortunately, those were uploaded to an old laptop that I don't have access to any longer, so I can't share right now, but this thing is a workhorse, it functions VERY well, makes quick work of your edging / light trenching, and cuts clean lines!"
5.0,Fast delivery.  Works great.
1.0,"Disappointing, the shroud around the blade gets caught on the edge of the grass behind the cut and actually damages the grass edge."
5.0,It is easy to see where the blade is cutting therefore getting a straight edge.  It does the job!
2.0,"i have owned one of these for years. one of the green housing models. greased it every year. bought one of these newer models. not as good
as the old one. first, bronze bearings in plastic housing. not good. they get hot and move out of place. second if they brush holders get hot. they
will warp are tear up the armature. which that's what happened to me. and of course it's out of warranty. so a buyer beware. this unit is for light use only. AND YES,i take care of my tools. i am a small engine mechanic."
4.0,"Item  received on time, well packaged and required very little assembly. Works very well and has plenty of power for edging. I haven't used other than for edging. If you can put up with having a cord dangling behind you, it's a great edger."
3.0,It has a lot of power but haven't used it enough for a good review.
4.0,"very easy to use, work best when dried, not good when wet."
4.0,Great for the price. No complaints
5.0,works great well built
5.0,"I bought this edger / trencher because I had an invisible pet fence to install. I figured out that buying this wouldn't be much more than renting one for a day at the big box store. It worked like a charm. I roughly 2 hours I trenched a line around my property the size of about one acre. It never stalled, overheated or anything. It worked through the small stones found under most grass yards. What I really like the most about it was that it trenches a very neat and clean cut about 3 inches deep. When I ran the line in the trench and just used my hands to pinch the trench shut, the yard looked like nothing was ever done to it. Very nice. Now I have it to clean up the garden bed edges occasionally to give my yard the look of a professional landscaping service. It adjusts to fit your height, so if you find yourself leaning just a bit, take your time to adjust the tool. It's worth your back not straining the whole time. I plan on using it this fall to draw lines in my beds to plant rows of small spring bulbs easily."
5.0,"I have tried the edging service of this product and it performed great. I have a THICK lawn that hasn't been edged over a year. This edger handled it, no problem! I did have to slow, but it cut through everything thing the first time. It's not very loud, easy to line up and assemble. Online Warranty Registration was quick and easy. Just wished they had how to videos on how to keep the edger in good working order and how to identify when the blade needs to be changed out."
5.0,"Very satisfied with this purchase. Edger is powerful, easy to operate, works with no issues for months now. The result is picturesque. My loan looks beautiful."
4.0,Liked the product and easy to handle.  Pleased with the delivery.
5.0,great just what I was looking for.
4.0,Works pretty good. But the screw comes out that hold the stick in the middle multiple time due to vibration.
5.0,"I had a similar one and could not bring it with me when I was relocated to another state so I bought it one. It is just as expected and kept my lawn edge flawless compared with my neighbors (sorry neighbors, your lawn service people is not as good as me or my edger)."
4.0,"4 stars until I use a few times. First use was a breeze! Noise level is average and it's easy to control. Nice lines but watch out for the concrete,if hit just back up a bit and continue edging. The blade is solid and overall seems to be a well built machine."
4.0,Love my edger. My yard looks great!
5.0,"Does a great job! Very easy to operate. After I had this grass grown over the concrete for a year and really thick, I had to go over only twice to get a perfect edge."
5.0,one of my favorite yard tools.....
5.0,This is an awesome edger!  I've had it for almost a year now and no issues at all. Great price and great purchase!
3.0,Does not edge the lawn very well
3.0,"I've had one long enough to know how long it will last. It will last through 2 blades. After the second blade is about wore out, the bearings wear out on this edger. Not great in longevity. I've used it almost entirely for edging lawn to concrete driveway and sidewalk.  It does a neater job than the bigger gas edgers and a line trimmer, though slower than line trimmer. Light weight which is good and sometimes not so good. Easy to manoeuver but sometimes light weight makes it harder for overgrown or tough spots. Thinner grass, like Burmuda will frequently not get completely cut next to edge. Could be that guide needs to be closer to blade. It would be nice if the left wheel would adjust down for curb edging. The handle needs to be larger, too. I like it but if I could find another that is more ergonomic, I will replace this with another brand. Needs more engineering. Black & Decker, call me and I will tell you how to make this product perfect."
5.0,Great for home use.
1.0,"Bought in April 2017 and the motor is bad, was good while it lasted"
5.0,Does an excellent job edging grass along sidewalks curbs and flowerbeds without a curb.
1.0,"When it worked, this edger was great. Unfortunately the engine started smoking and the unit died.  I tried disassembling it, cleaning and putting it back together. I would have been much smarter using this from a local merchant to get repaired or replaced."
4.0,It worked as expected and made our trench digging a lot easier!
2.0,"When I first received this edger it worked fine. But on the second time out the motor would sputter, stall and not run at full speed. I have returned it and purchased a gasoline powered replacement edger. Its too bad as when it worked it did a good job edging and its light weight made it very easy to operate (dragging a power cord aside). Assembly was relatively easy, but it took a little patience in ""threading"" the bolts around the power cord running the length of the handle pole."
5.0,Does as described.
5.0,When growing up I always wanted a edger with a metal blade and not have to use a weedwacker. Well after cutting my grass and killing my second weed eater I knew it was time. I found this gem on FB for $20. Edged my lawn yesterday and I could not be happier. No more pulling the cord a million times to start my weedeater. You do need to go back and forth a few times but it will give you a great clean line. I also have the B&D blower and bush trimmer which have been working great for the past 6 years. I could not be happier with this edger and the price I paid.
5.0,Very good. Thx. Working  well.
5.0,"solid effective, well built. It replaced the edger use of an 0.065 edger/trimmer combination. We have a strong St. Augustine thatch that the string trimmer couldn't  handle. The B&D did a fine job. Recommended."
5.0,I used this twice then after that my electric 40V Black Decker weed trimmer/edger does the rest.  So I can see using this once or twice every year. There was a slight problem I remember riding on the curb a little but no biggie.
1.0,I have had this edger going on three years.  It really is a poor edger and I am ready to throw it away.
1.0,"The blade is not sharp enough to cut the grass along the edge. Blows up a lot of dirt; and will trench through dirt, but not cut grass..  I wound up returning it and using my manual edger.  Worthless product."
1.0,"This might be a wonderful product, but it arrived more than a week after being ordered despite PRIME 2 day shipping, and when it did arrive, the package was all banged up but, most importantly, the product's power cable was cut into two pieces and the unit was dented and obviously damaged.  I think it was a returned used and useless product and I sure do hope that its replacement is not also useless.  Whomever is responsible for quality control is not doing their job."
3.0,"it cuts fine and has plenty of power, but the handle is loose and twists from side to side - also the handle could stand to be wider, like the old black and decker"
5.0,works great
4.0,"It does a good job edging.  However, the trigger requires too much pressure.  I have to take a break after about 10 minutes to rest my fingers & hand."
5.0,"Cuts easily with plenty of power, and I love the ability to use around flower beds as well.  The manual needs to be updated, though, because the handle cannot be changed from right handed to left or vice versa.  They no longer include that part, nor is there any way to attach one."
4.0,This works great! Very easy to use !
5.0,Works great. My yard is small. I would buy again.
1.0,"So disappointing. Black & Decker used to be a go to brand for quality. I had a 20 year old black & decker edger which was getting really hard to get blades for so I thought I'd replace it with a new one. I took it out of the box and what was aluminum on the old one is now all plastic.  Ok, I suppose plastic doesnt always mean cheap so off to the yard.  My bermuda grass was fairly well entrenched along the sidewalk since it had been awhile since I used up the last blade in my otherwise still working old edger. I made it about 20 feet with the new one before it started to lose power and slow.  When I turned it off smoke rolled out of it. The old black and decker edger was listed at 6 amp and it had cut through the same grass for years."
5.0,this edger is amazing...easy for an 88 yr. old woman  to work...It gets a sharp look to the grass edge and I am very pleased.
4.0,"Worked great, but cord in pipe was too long making assembly difficult."
5.0,Works great
5.0,Made my yard look great. Works well in the suburbs.
5.0,Good tool to have
5.0,"Was a gift for my husband, and he LOVES it.  He plans to use treachery attachment when rain stops.  At least he got to do all the lawn edges before rain started!"
5.0,"This has been the best edger I have had.  I have used several gas ones, but this has lots of power for electric."
5.0,Love this edger. Works great.
5.0,works good just what I needed
5.0,Loveit  just wish i had someone younger to come and use it. haha
5.0,Gift he really likes it.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS!  I am not a huge fan of buying bargain yard tools, but this electric trimmer works great!"
5.0,"I have used both electric and gas powered edgers in the past.  I prefer the gas ones since you don't have to drag a cord behind you.  The electrics never seemed to have enough power, either.  However, this unit is different.  Seems to have plenty of power and really isn't bad to use.  You still have a cord, but the handle design keeps it out of your way and behind you.  Very reliable and does a good job edging.  The first pass took a while since there was a lot of stuff that needed cutting.  After that, subsequent trimming is very quick and easy.  Glad I purchased this."
5.0,Works very well.  I don't edge all the time so the cord is not a huge hassle.  Less so than gas would be.
5.0,really pleased with its operation
4.0,"Has been a good product, the bolt came loose after a few uses, but I tightened it and haven't had a problem since."
5.0,Very nice edger heavier than i thought which you need to edge
4.0,"Not big on corded stuff, but it works well for the price."
4.0,"Replacement unit for prior same tool.  Years on the first.  Finally died;  purchased the same.  Effective tool, cuts cleanly and is quick.  Your soil will effect the performance.  Be wary of wet/damp soil as this will clump up on the blade and cover.  Allow to dry somewhat for easier trimming."
5.0,Works very well and I it was a good investment.
5.0,"Great buy works just fine saved a lot of time edgeing grass.
Thank You"
5.0,"It does the job, but like a motorize edger."
5.0,"Used twice. Works great. Easy to use. After the first time, even easer than string trimming and much more economical."
5.0,Works great for me.
5.0,"Quick assembly - Good Depth - Works for edging and cleaning out your concrete cut lines.  Pretty good at not throwing particulate in your face, but DEFINITELY where safety glasses.  Your typical 15A residential circuit can handle supply this tool with enough current. The safety guard seems to clog??!?? not sure if this is typical or if I was going in too deep? ""That's what she said""!"
4.0,Does pretty well as you can see. It does seem to get caught up when the overgrowth is too high compared to the sidewalk. This makes it hard to keep it flush because you have to lean it back to raise the blade. Doesn't kick back too hard when you hit pavement.
4.0,Works very efficiently.  Cuts a very clean edge.
5.0,"I've never edged my lawn before and I've lived in this house for 8 years. I thought I was doing a decent job with a weedwhacker but my edges were still extremely overgrown. Received this tool and spent 8 hours cleaning up my driveway, curbs, and sidewalk. I live on a corner so there was lots of sidewalk to do! In some spots the overgrowth was 4 inches onto the sidewalk! I didn't take any photos of the worst spots because I was so hard at work and just focused on getting it done. This edger works great! It's tricky to keep going in a straight line when you're as overgrown as I was. The next time will be so much easier. There's something very satisfying when you did a good job with the edger, was straight and close enough to the edge of the pavement. The extra grass and dirt come away like you cut crust off of bread.
Works great, no running issues or overheating even with a full days hard work
Bought a 100 foot extension cord and extra blade ( figuring I'd blow out this first blade no problem) the blade it comes with still looks good and will serve me well for several more uses.
Love the convenience of electric, maneuvering the cord was no problem and no gas or oil to mess with.
I saw reviews about the guard being too low. This model has a height adjustment on the guard, even with all the dirt and over growth I had, I didn't not have to raise the guard.
Great tool! Super happy"
1.0,Handle for very short people.  I am 6'2 and this requires hunching over the entire time.  Under powered as well.  Just not good.
5.0,"Works great with little effort, very pleased with the end result!"
1.0,"Unsafe, unsafe, unsafe ...the edger throws materiel wildly and for great distance...

In one use it hit my son in the neck, standing 20ft away and busted out my car windshield, just a little closer.

Too nervous to continue using, now I have an unfinished lawn job, short $250, and most of all a very scared kid!

***DO NOT BUY THIS UNSAFE EDGER***"
4.0,"The first time around takes time and patience of which my husband lacks, but once you break through and go back and forth a few times it turns out well. It is not as wide as we would like it to be however."
4.0,Very good as described
5.0,Worked fine with no issues. Had some tough edging too do and edger got through fine. I just went a little slower and let the edger do the work on the tough edging. I expect edging to get easier the more it's done. Has enough power being electric for the homeowner.
4.0,Works great so far!
2.0,"Worked ok, but don't expect it to last more than the warrantee.  At about that point, the motor started rattling and grinding.  Right now it's in the trash."
5.0,I'm so glad I got this edger. It was easy to set up from the box and easy to use.
5.0,Work great!  Does a fantastic job!
4.0,Works great once you get use to the depth setting.
4.0,Worked as advertised.  My wife expected something different.  Satisfied with the quality.
5.0,Great product!
5.0,It's a really tough machine love it
2.0,"It worked fairly well for the first half of the yard, then it started to fall apart, bu the end of the first use the level controlling the trencher attachment had come loose, and the part was dangling.

Seems like it might work if you have a small piece of sidewalk to edge, but for anything more it can't handle it, broke within the first 45 minutes."
1.0,"This item is awful. The same day I got it, the nut blade kept loosening no matter what I did. Black & Decker did replace it promptly at no charge but now after using it just 3x, the power went completely dead. Plus, for some reason, you can't cut anything going forward. It only cuts walking backward for some reason. It's a piece of junk."
4.0,"Solid machine, easy to use."
4.0,Works best if prior lines have been cut along sidewalks and drive.
2.0,only lasted 18 months.
5.0,Love my edger easy to use light weight even 60 yr old female can handle easily
1.0,"I have used this on my yard twice, and after the second use it smelled of burnt electrical and began smoking from inside. After spending almost $90, I was able to edge my yard twice. And, my yard is a very average side yard."
2.0,I recently purchased and have used this product 7 or 8 times this summer. I had to get a new one after having the previous model for 10 years. It seems like the gears are stripped and is not spinning correctly. Not happy.
5.0,Does a great  job!
4.0,Not a good product!
1.0,"Super disappointed with this edger. On my second use of it as a trencher, the metal guide plate's seating flange (plastic!) broke allowing the guide plate to spin and hit the blade. Upon further inspection, the guide plate seating flange is also part of the motor housing (plastic!) and you can now see the shaft bearings open and exposed to dirt. There is already a catch in the shaft bearings so I don't expect them to last much longer.
I was trenching 3-6 inch creep of Bermuda grass along concrete. Wet dirt build-up in the shield may have stressed the plate resulting in seating flange failure.
I've had good luck in the past with other B&D products, but not with this one."
3.0,"Going to return, My lawn is about 3"" tall when cut, the guard damages the edge of the lawn. Just does not work for me.  If one cuts the lawn on a lower setting, then this is the tool you need."
5.0,My husband LOVES this trimmer/edger! He says it's easy to use and always does a great job...2 thumbs up!
5.0,Very Nice.
5.0,Works good
5.0,"It's a great product, though if you have big weeds sticking onto your sidewalk you might want to first edge with a string trimmer. After the first time of going through it, It is a breeze to edge. The first time was the hardest for me though because it was hard to find where to place the edger, keep it their, and get through all the dirt.

-Just an Amazon Customer"
5.0,"This is the second one that we have owned, very easy to use. It does a great job on the edges like my old one. Highly recommend it"
3.0,Not as powerful as I need it to be.
2.0,"same edger as 10 years Go but more chester
i would not recommend this product spend a few more dollars and get a professional one"
5.0,"I usually stay away from just about anything that is electric and used for out door activities, and opt for gas powered instead, but after reading numerous positive reviews for the Black + Decker edger, I decided to try it.  Compared to the gas powered ones that were around $300, $78 for the BD sounded a little better.  It was super easy to assemble, and even easier getting started.  The first day that I had it, I edged my 30 ft long sidewalk, 60 ft long driveway, and the curb.  It never bogged down once, and had plenty of power.  I was pretty impressed with the power of it."
5.0,I LOVE IT
5.0,"Just as advertised. Works perfectly. Powerful enough to cut through the toughest turf. Steering and tracking very easy. A little bit tricky to unpack and assemble, took about 30 minutes. Instructions weren't as clear as could be."
5.0,Light and easy to operate. Makes a good straight edge on the side walk and curbing. Plenty of power and easy to clean up. Great value.
5.0,"I kick myself for waiting so long to purchase this item. I had it on my wish list for some time, but I always would talk myself out of the purchase. Now, I wish I bought it sooner. It is lightweight, but cuts through tough Tennessee clay. Before, I was using an edger attachment on my weed eater, but it was awkward to use, heavy, and did not have the power to dig through some soil. As soon as I received my edger, I made the adjustments and put it to work. It performed great! Of course, you have to drag along an extension cord, but I ain't complaining. The trim around my driveway and sidewalk looks professionally done. Why did I wait so long?!"
4.0,Works quite well although the cutter-shield area frequently plugged because of the extra grass that was removed.  That was not the case during followup edging (less grass and soil debris).
5.0,Works great
5.0,It's all good.
4.0,"Great edger ... Had a Weed Eater Gas edger and it finally broke down. I couldn't find another Weed Eater brand to replace it anywhere. I thought I would give the Black + Decker electric edger a try and it cuts and edges as well, if not better than the gas edger. Only pit fall I you have to deal with the extension cord getting caught on things. Other than that very powerful motor and blade cuts nicely. I have always had good luck with Black + Decker products in the past."
5.0,"good product, good vendoe"
5.0,"Great tool, works as expected"
5.0,The lawn makes it easy to obtain and maintain a straight edge along the sidewalk and drive way. It makes that job easy!
2.0,"Front wheel came off in first 2 minutes of operation, found the bolt which is a star type - not the traditional phllips head or flat head bolt - inconvenient to say the least - very disappoinint"
5.0,Great edger! It easily cut through some pretty thick over growth. I rented a gas edger last year and spent $50 for three hours and this edger did just as good a job!
4.0,"a little hard to get used to but does a good job be careful to keep it on track,plenty of power for maintenance edging."
4.0,Performs great
1.0,"Bought this today to edge a short driveway.  Unfortunately the front wheel falls off every 12 to 24 inches of use, no matter how tight I tighten the bolt.  So the wheel rolls off, then I spend 5 to 10 minutes looking for the screw/bolt and the nut.  I am so frustrated at this point that I will NOT clean it up before dragging this sorry thing back to the store.  Don't waste your money or your time."
5.0,"This is a great, no-fuss way to edge your yard and landscaping.  I did not want the hassle of trying to start one that was gas driven, nor did I want to fuss with batteries that can add weight.  This is a ""plug-in-and-go"" model that is very easy to assemble and use.  I've used it twice already."
5.0,"Easy to use, plenty of power"
4.0,have not tried to trench yet and once I have finished the intial cutting then subsequent trimmings should be easier
1.0,"This product could not last s specified by the manufacturer. Recently, the blade easily get sucked - it won't rotate while the edger itself is running - I guess the gearing system must have worn out. Bad product!!!"
5.0,Works great. Fast shipping.
5.0,"I wish I bought one of these a long time ago. I used a cheap weed wacker before I bought this and my edges were always all over the place. Now they are very straight. Only time will tell if it will break like a lot of reviewers have claimed, but so far so good."
4.0,easy to handle
5.0,Takes a little getting used to. Makes the lawn look great.
5.0,Works great.  Makes the lawn look super nice.
3.0,Ehhh. Dealing with gas is better when it comes to something like this. But it was money well sent.
5.0,"Works as Advertised...  did the job very well - easy to operate and POWERFUL - it chewed through a couple years build up of Grass in no time at all!..  Feels strong enough to do the job -  the ANGLE of the handle takes a bit of getting used to,  but you hardly notice that after awhile - the wheels help a lot!.. as does the GUIDE -  In over an hour of use I never 'tracked off' the sidewalk I was edging.."
1.0,Waste of money. No torque . Just a circular saw with a handle and a weird blade.
5.0,PERFECT FOR ME
3.0,"This item edges with a blade, not a piece of monofilament.  The blade creates a ""trench"" in the dirt like and old-fashioned gasoline edger.  In my opinion, it creates a more attractive edge on the grass than a string trimmer.  However, because I want the most perfect edge possible, I still have go over some spots with electric hand shears.  I had to do this with a string trimmer too.

Go slowly the first time you use it to get the trench started.  Once you've created a trench in the dirt, the second time will go faster.  It's powerful enough to get the job done.  And it's easy to use (just pull the trigger).  The blade depth is adjustable.

Black + Decker says that you can use this device to dig a narrow-depth trench in the yard (for cables, etc.).  I've never used it for this purpose, but I believe it would probably work (as long as you don't need the trench to be very deep).

Dislikes:  The blade angle is not adjustable.  I have a sloped curb next to the street.  When edging in this location, I have to lift one side and hold the unit at a slight angle.  If it blade angle was adjustable, it would make things easier and more precise.  I'm giving the unit three stars instead of four for this reason."
5.0,Works wonderful
5.0,love it
4.0,"Disappointed in the ""trenching"" mode as it is just a pencil thin trench, although it produces a nice depth. But as an edger it works very well, so 4 stars for that."
5.0,Does what I ask it to do
5.0,"Great edger, lots of power, easy to use."
1.0,"I would not purchase this item again. I had a older model less power and used it for 12 years and after 12 years I did not have to get repaired one time. I purchased this one in the end of the season used 1 time. How often do you edge your lawn. If you do it right 4 times maybe. Anyway this edger is a piece of junk. I will give the benefit that I may at the most used 6 times from August 2015 to July 2017 . July of 2017 being my 7th time and it started smoking, as soon as I seen smoke I stopped and unplugged. I contacted Black and  Decker last week and was told you missed your warranty by 1 day. Yes I said 1 day contact the seller, Do not buy from anyone that sells this product it is junk. Black & Decker does not make things like they did before. I mean 12 years out of my first one and not even 3 seasons of use out of a heavy duty one. They call it the hog edger , I call it the junk edger. Come on someone stand behind your product. I have been a Amazon buyer for ever you can look at all my buying history. David A Coonrod (314)644-8065 13317 East Lane Saint Louis Missouri 63128."
4.0,Does the job!
5.0,"This tool has made edging SO much easier!  It used to take me days to use a shovel to edge by our sidewalk, but this has cut it down to one quick afternoon!  The lawn looks excellent now!"
5.0,Does a great job!
5.0,Got what we expected from this item. Seems pretty sturdy and got the job done. Our driveway hasn't looked this good for years!
5.0,powerful and easy! Was using a manual edger and got this for Father's Day. Great gift!
1.0,"I used it for the first time and broke before I even finished.  Did an OK job for the half an hour it worked
Don't buy this"
5.0,"I am not a Black&Decker fan. Tried to find a good alternative to this edger, but couldn't. Assembly and navigating the instructions did nothing to improve my frame of mind, but once it was functional and I put it the ground to edge my sidewalks, I was very pleased with the simplicity and effectiveness of the machine. I will follow up next week because these walks haven't been edged before, but it looks as professional as it would if done by a lawn service and took only about an hour. Happy camper."
5.0,Love this...best edger I've ever bought.  I've not tried using the trencher yet but it edges so easy.
5.0,well worth the price
5.0,Love it works great shipped extremely quick.
5.0,Does wonders
5.0,Great gift for the price!!
5.0,It does what it is supposed to do and does it just fine.
5.0,So happy I took a chance. Great product. Great price!
4.0,"This is a simple tool for creating and maintaining a sharp edge to the lawn separating the grass from the sidewalk. Depending on how severe the overgrowth of grass onto the concrete walkway is, it may take several passes to cleanup the edge. The balance of the tool allows me to use one hand to guide the edger. My only complaint is the need to run the edger back and forth to get a clean edge. It is unclear as yet if the fault lies with my technique or it is the design of the tool. I have yet to use the trencher feature so I cannot comment at the moment but I will update this review over the next two months."
5.0,"I've been very impressed with this edger. Makes a clean, thick edge with no more effort than vacuuming."
5.0,Really works well.
1.0,"These are very poor quality. Don't waste your money. The main bo

Don't waste the money! Fell apart after 3rd use"
1.0,Junk won't go thru south Texas dirt and won't follow the edge
5.0,Just ordered this as a replacement for same B & D Edger I have now - not sure how long I've had the first one but 10+ years wouldn't be stretching it.  The first one still works and used it this weekend.  The shaft holding the blade has a major wobble in it and has power spurts now and then so short of burning it up time to bury it.  All the yard powered tools in my garage are B & D sans the lawnmower and I've yet to  have a problem with any of them and my current edger is the first of my collection to get close to be worn out.
1.0,hard to use edging not effective
5.0,works great
4.0,"7/5/17 - So far, I really like this edger.  It is lightweight, but feels ""beefier"" than I anticipated.  I have only used it one time, along my driveway, to clean up the edge.  Once I use it more, and try the trencher, I will update my review.  I am planning to trench to clean up some beds this summer."
5.0,"This edger really works great. I had another brand which was only 2 HP, and it worked ok for a number of years, but this Black & Decker
out performs any and every edger that I have used."
5.0,"Cheap, easy, simple.
Easy to put together, even easier to use. Only minor complaint is that the handle doesn't quite line up straight with the front wheel so I typically need to be careful about letting it drift too far from the sidewalk."
4.0,Does a good job on my tough FL grass. You will of course need an extension cord to use it. It is a touch low for me even on the max handle extension (l'm 6' tall).
3.0,The blade keeps getting wobbly and needs retightening. It's a bummer
5.0,"easy to use,great tool"
5.0,Wonderful tool
5.0,"Very impressed with this thing. Has more than enough power to edge several of my walk ways, and takes little effort to use the machine."
2.0,"We've had our edger since 8/14... it's worked great until we pulled it out this summer.  It just quit.  Since we don't edge during the winter, it's been used for about 9 months total.  I would've hoped it would last a little longer."
5.0,"I purchased the Black & Decker LE750 in December of 2007 and it lasted 9.5 years. It would have most definitely lasted longer had I not stored it outside in the rain and SoCal sun with absolutely no cover.
Awesome edger that I worked hard for many years! I couldn't recommend more highly.
Just bought a new one today!"
5.0,"low cost, great for townhome."
5.0,Great product for smaller jobs
5.0,"Nice product, seems to be of good quality. Will have to use it for awhile and see how it holds up"
1.0,Need to send back worked for 4 min an quit pos junk
5.0,Good product at a fair price works great
5.0,Had my last one ten years when I saw I could get another just like it I jumped at the opportunity!  This one hasn't let me down yet either!  Does a great job and is rather powerful.
4.0,"Works well, BUT.....definitely takes practice to get a sharp line."
1.0,10 POUND PAPER WEIGHT.GREAT FOR A TRENCHER. DIGS UP LAWN YOU DON'T WANT EDGED
5.0,Easy to set-up. Easy to use and does a great job.
1.0,"Didn't even get 5 uses out of this piece of junk.  I am assuming most of these positive reviews were made shortly after purchase and after only a few uses, at most.  People, you need to use the product multiple times before posting a review.  Posting a positive review without having much to back it up does a disservice to potential buyers that read the positive reviews and decide to purchase a product.  The first few uses, I loved it.  It did a great job edging. However, about 8 feet into my 5th use, the engine suddenly burnt out without warning. So basically it cost me about $25 per use.  It almost would be better value to just pay someone to mow the yard and do the edging at that rate.  I guess I can add Black + Decker to the list of companies that used to make good products, but now just produce cheap products in China and area no longer worth purchasing.  Very disappointed in this purchase and I recommend that no one waste their money on this piece of junk."
5.0,edger works fine
5.0,"Works very well.  Chews through the dirt, even a stretch that hadn't been edged in long while"
4.0,Used it for about 500' of sidewalks--and seemed to work great.
2.0,"As my first experience with an edger that actually cuts a groove with a metal wheel, I don't like it at all. It's heavy and clumsy to use, and it leaves the edge of grass in pretty bad shape and all dirty. It's not at all like what I'm used to with a weed-whacker type edger that cuts a smooth line. If you don't run the blade right up against the concrete, it doesn't get the grass right on the edge. I'm going to switch to a battery-powered weed-whacker type edger next. My neighbor has a Torx and was showing me how easy it is to use so I'm probably going to try that next."
1.0,My wife got me this for Fathers Day.  After 1 hour of use the blade stopped spinning.
5.0,This is SO much nicer than my old one.  Has a different style blade that the old spinner.  Make your driveway and walks look fab.
4.0,Does a very nice job of edging my yard.
5.0,"Works well. When assembling, there is a bit too much cord to stuff inside the pole/handle. Otherwise, easy to assemble and use."
5.0,I edge every weekend. I was tired of using a gas edger and wanted to try something different. This Electrical edger didn't disappoint. It is super powerful and does the job neatly. So neatly my neighbors asked me how my lines look so straight!
5.0,"Been awhile since I used one of these but I'll get the hang of it again. My parents home, the grass and edges are so thick, it will take a while to get it looking nice again!  I love it!"
5.0,GRRRReat
5.0,Great little edger.
5.0,Excellent piece of garden equipment!
1.0,"Do not buy this edger. I had this edger for 10 months and used it about 6 times for 20 minutes per time. Then it suddenly stopped working. Something in the switch broke. It does have a 2 year warranty but B&D will require you to take it to a service center. If you don't live where there is one then the cost of shipping it is on you. AVOID THIS, AND ANY OTHER BLACK & DECKER PRODUCTS!!"
5.0,Easy to use and does a good job.
4.0,fast and fun to use. a great value.
5.0,Well improved edger over my old Black + Decker edger. It has a good gauge wheel in front to help support unit and unit is able to cut small trench in yard if needed. Really good edger.
5.0,Hadn't edged my lawn in over a year with lots of overgrowth.  This plowed through it no problem.
1.0,Have sane problem as others...got for my son who lives next door.  He was using for the third time when it started smoking and just quit.  Of course I did not get the extended warranty and it is just less then 14 months old.
2.0,"Another Black and Decker disappointment.  It took me three passes to properly edge the lawn around my driveway with this item.  In keeping with Black and Decker's current policy regarding its lawn appliances,  I think mostly it is designed to assure that any owner of this item will have to buy replacement blades.  It is useless for edging any portion of a lawn not bordering cement or other hard flat surfaces. I purchased this edger as a replacement for my Black and Decker string trimmer because the string trimmer was using 25 feet of string every time I edged my lawn.  I think I have learned my lesson with respect to Black and Decker products, to bad as B&D, before acquisition, had a good reputation for tools."
5.0,Works great
3.0,"The tool is powerful enough to make a shallow, narrow trench.  I read in other consumer responses on Amazon that the depth that it could achieve was about 4 inches, but I found that I could only get about 2 inches deep with the trenching setting, which didn't meet my needs, and 1.5 inches with the edger setting.  The total blade length is listed as 7.5 inches.  When you figure that the center motor spindle would be half of that (3.75 inches), and then there is the housing/tool frame that extends below the motor spindle (about 1.5 inches below the spindle), the maximum amount of exposed blade is around two inches.  You can't go any deeper than this since the tool frame ""bottoms out"" on the dirt or grass that you are trenching through.  The manufacturer should have indicated the maximum depth achievable with the two settings with their product information because I would have kept on shopping."
4.0,"This is a decent buy. It doesn't trench really deep though,  so I always have to make more than one round.
What it is good for is creating a super neat edge between my grass and the curb."
5.0,Thank goodness for this machine!  It has saved e a lot of time and my back!
5.0,Works great! and a good price.
5.0,"I was edging manually, if you can believe it!  The EdgeHog is so easy to operate, seems sturdy and does a great job!"
5.0,I love it
5.0,"be sure to use a 12a cord for the full power, but works great"
3.0,"It takes practice , but so far so good."
5.0,Product was easy to setup and worked perfectly.
4.0,Great product for the price
1.0,I have never needed an edge before. The wife and I purchase a new home and I noticed another lawn down the street whose driveway and walkway was edged. I liked it. I have own this home for 11 months and in the south you cut your grass on Christmas.  I noticed the grass was really creeping on to my concrete and looked horrible. I tried cutting is back with the trimmer no luck. This lays the ground work. my concrete edges have not been touched in years. I purchased this and went to work really digging in a edging my whole property and the edger was powerful enough to chop thru the grass and dirt. ( no rocks) and made my property  look well maintained. Now once done should be no issues keep up the beauty. ********NEW UPDATE.... MOTOR HAS LOST LOTS OF POWER AND MAKES  NOISE AND SMELLS.... CONTACTING BLACK AND DECKER DUE TO OUT OF 30 DAYS.  OH BOY THIS SHOULD BE FUN.
5.0,Great edger very good
1.0,"It edged the yard okay two or three times, but today a coiled spring assembly under the blade mount and edge guide (see my photos) somehow came loose and got wrapped around the blade shaft while I was edging. This spring assembly isn't shown in the User Guide, which is the only source of owner information about the edger. The edger was always used properly and never abused, and the blade was installed properly. It's still in its 2-year warranty, so I dropped it off at a B&D repair pickup location and they sent me brand-new replacement in two weeks. Not trusting this replacement to last, I bought a $300 gasoline-powered edger with a 140cc engine and a 3-sided, 9-inch blade. Unfortunately, on its first deep edging, it died frequently due its low torque and thus had to be pushed very slowly. The electric LE750, by comparison, has sufficient torque (12.5 ft lbs) for shallow edging and never dies, making it seem preferable to the gasoline edger."
1.0,I intend to give this to someone I don't like. Not worth the money or time putting it together. Really not what I expected. BEWARE!
5.0,"This item is a must buy for the money. It made small work of a large job. Arrived on time, new in box. Easy assembly. From box to working in 10 minutes."
3.0,"Strong motor but requires several pass-overs in think areas and sometimes skips on to the sidewalk with sparks. Clogs easy.
Can use trencher but have not figured out the edging part. Only used once but the edges look good. Expected more for this priced product which is discounted on Amazon."
5.0,"Great product, strong, works well. Use a screw driver to unclog dirt build up."
1.0,I only used this edger 2 times. Halfway through the second time it stopped working. The return policy only allows for 30 days but this isn't an item you would use more than once or twice in a month window. Not a fair policy!  Now I'm out $85 and I have to go buy another edger.
1.0,"It worked for 35 minutes and conked out. The motor was running but the blade would spin no more. Very frustrating, especially for a B+D product, especially for $78."
4.0,"Performs well, little tough on the first trim, but anticipate easier on the next trim"
5.0,Works great and is easy to handle.
1.0,"This tool is useless! Considering the many good reviews I was shocked to see how poorly it performed under light use. Clogs up, jumps up and skips across sidewalk."
5.0,Easy to assemble and easy to use.  Does a great job of edging the lawn
5.0,"Love it, I've been trying for months to convince myself that purchasing a gas edger was the way to go, but couldn't convince myself to pay at least $300 for one, so I decided to try out this electric Black Decker for a fraction of the cost. I must say this is a great edge. I love how light weight; durable it is. The edging is so simple i recommend this for anyone people of all ages. Gas edger may be better for commercial uses"
4.0,Only issue is with heavy spring growth it takes several passes. Otherwise more than meets expections.
2.0,After only one use blade separated from unit.
4.0,Lot's of power. Buying electric was a good choice for me. I will only use this a few times a year and I am done struggling with gas tools that are frequently hard to maintain and start.
2.0,does not work as described .
2.0,"Ineffective. Have to go over the same areas 3-4 times to get it to look right. The handle, though secured as instructed, is not stable at all and turns about. Needs a power switch rather than a trigger to power it-- I have arthritis and carpal tunnel and was in severe pain for 3 days following use. It's better than nothing I guess.., but should just spend a little more and get something with better quality. Its handling is comparable to pushing a toy truck with a broom handle. Kind of a pain in the a**.  Will be returning this after just one use."
5.0,as advertised
1.0,Poorly built and does a poor job of edging.
4.0,Love it!
5.0,"Strong, easy to use. As I always talk about drawbacks, that is the wheel is quite easy to stick a lot of mud. You have to stop to clean up the wheel and then continue."
1.0,"Broke in 10 months, very light work motor smoked and sparks flew. Used maybe 15 times what a waste of money."
5.0,"The Edge Hog was easy to assemble, just insert the handles and snug the thumb bolts tight. Read the instructions to adjust the cutting height desired. This is great along driveways and side walks. I have crisp straight lines now and its a lot easier then maneuvering a weed eater in awkward positions trying to make straight cuts. The blade is very robust and cuts through the soil and Bermuda sod with ease."
5.0,"I received this within four days of purchase. Tried it out the following weekend. Assembly was simple right out of the box (no tools required since the blade came on mine). For the first pass on our driveway and flower beds I used the deepest setting. It cut through dirt, moss, and grass with ease. It shoots dirt forward so some house rinsing is in order, but it works great. For the price I don't think it can be beat. Highly recommend."
4.0,I've used it three times so far.  With some effort it produces a picture perfect edge along sidewalks.  It takes more time and cleanup than the nylon line trimmers but the result for me in comparison is outstanding. Only sorry I didn't buy earlier.
4.0,It has enough power to dig deep and is easy to handle
5.0,Quality product
4.0,Works great!
4.0,nice trim to the grass lines looks good only thing after first use a lot of dirt to clean up but works well.
5.0,What used to take ~50 minutes now gets done in 15.
3.0,Not great but it serves the purpose. If you used a gas edger inthe past this will be a big let down.
5.0,"this does the perfect job.  I was a little worried about an electric edger versus a gas powered, but for the price this does just as well as the gas models.  I don't mind an electric cord following me.  Do wish the on off switch was a little easier to keep down, my finger gets sore holding it.  But for the money I would buy this again."
5.0,This Edger works wonderful.  I have always edged with a weed eater before and could not get a consistent straight line.  This Black & Decker edger was so easy to use.  I just plugged it in and put the wheel on the sidewalk and it made a perfect edge line. This is very light and easy to carry around.  This was a great purchase.
3.0,"A regular string trimmer is easier and does just as good if not better on sidewalk edging.

It is useful for adding plastic week barriers around trees."
5.0,"I normally don't write product reviews but was compelled to do so after using this edger.  I tend to shy away from electric yard tools and use gas powered ones.  My gas powered edger died about two years ago so the grass was very thick bordering my driveway and sidewalk.  Before using this edger I was very skeptical about how it would perform.  I was blown away by the performance of this edger.  It chewed through two years worth of grass like it was nothing.  This edger is very balanced and was easy to keep on track.  It runs so smooth and is very quiet, unlike the gas powered edgers I have used in the past.  I am very pleased with this edger and would recommend it for home use."
4.0,"We have been using this edger only a few times but so far we are loving it. It does take awhile to learn the trick to edge it right.

Only complaint we have is the handle. Wish its longer and adjustable so we can adjust accordingly to our height. Husband says his neck hurts after he finished edging because he had to lean over throughout the process."
4.0,nice
4.0,"Power is a little lacking, but worth it for the price."
4.0,"Couldn't rate it during the initial try as the st Augustine grass was very thick.  Took my time and edged through it.
2nd edging was a breeze."
1.0,"Not very durable or sturdy. Doesn't work very well, falls apart easily"
4.0,"Good little machine. I never had an edger for my house before and was sick of using my weedwacker to trim the edge. I figure for $80 it was worth a shot.
Assemble wasn't to bad. Just attach 2 pieces and it's done. However, the cord runs through the shaft and it gets in the way of the bolt you try to put through. It's a long cord so it's a hassle internally. But once it's done it's done.
Using is simple. Squeeze the trigger and off you go. There are little tabs in the front and rear of the guard that offer some guidance on cutting. If the grass is over the sidewalk edge it can be tricky. Mine was but I'm pretty good with tools so it was a little easier for me.
Reason for the 4 star is 1. The assembly. That cord was annoying. 2. When I was using on the curb the wheels are spaced too far in the rear. You need to hold the machine up as you go. I think there is a attachment but again more $$$.

Side note. I have zoysia grass which tends to make long roots. This cut thru no problem but I have to grab and pull out some pieces since the roots were deep. You can adjust from 1"" to 1 1 1/2"" to 2"". 1 1/2"" made a nice cut for me"
5.0,"This is basically a circular saw on wheels and kicks grass!!!  Lightweight, very easy to assemble and simple to use.  Love it!!!"
2.0,"This tool does an OK job as an edger (even though I still prefer and mobility of a string edger). Yet, as a trencher, its capabilities are really lame. At its maximum depth (1 1/2 in) it provides a very crude and wide channel dug through the dirt, in contrast with my expectation to have a nice narrow trench into the soil.
To have an idea, I tried to make a trench in order to install a lawn edging. The trench this tool provided barely allowed 1.4 of the edging to be dug in the ground.
Now I'm returning this tool and buying a manual trench tool, which definitely provides me enough depth and gets the job done."
5.0,"Just bought a house and the previous owners let the edging get away from them so there was about 2"" of overgrowth on my driveway and sidewalk. The Edge Hog worked perfectly! It cut in crisp new edges and the guide on it helped to keep me from striking the concrete with the blade. Great price and works perfectly. I would highly recommend this product!"
2.0,"I purchased this edger new from my local Walmart.  The assembly/design is rather ridiculous.  The power cord (sleeved in flimsy plastic) runs through the shaft.  Which is fine.  Except that ""some assembly required"" means that you actually have to thread a bolt through the shaft....through which the power cord runs.  I opened my brand new box and got the lower section bolted together (though shaking my head at the idiocy of the design) and started on the second section.  I immediately noticed the plastic sleeve was torn up.  Strange.  This is a brand new, never opened box.  The next thing I noticed is that I can't shove the two pieces together as the cord is too long for the shaft.  It simply balled up to the point I couldn't compress the two pieces.  I kept trying.  No dice.  Which is good.  Because then I noticed that there was an actual cut in the power cord itself, exposing wires.  It is going back to the store today.  I will order a more professional-grade gas edger that isn't made by monkeys....."
5.0,"I had this same weed eater for 8 years before it died on me, so I ordered a new one just like it.  Works great and was $10 cheaper than Lowes."
1.0,"The way the handle is angled it's difficult to get any leverage.  The stabilizing handle needs to be located lower to allow you to guide the blade appropriately.  For some one 6'1"" the angle is terrible.  PS after 10 minutes the blade stopped spinning.  My recommendation is pass."
2.0,"worked great, twice. the motor gears are now stripped and product is not usable."
5.0,Love it!  Easy to put together and does a fantastic job with edging driveways and sidewalks.  Lightweight and doesn't take up a lot of room.
5.0,Good machine... I only use it to edge around my pool.
5.0,work well!
1.0,Unfortunately this was out of stock in the Uk so I purchased this in the USA. This was unfortunately a big mistake. When it was delivered it was 110v and a 2 pin plug. We are 240v and 3 square pin plug. I obviously didn't do my homework and it cost me a funtune in shipping ( more than the item cost) would I do this again.....not any time soon....I hope it works for those of you in the US...I expected great neat edges in my lawn and ended up paying a fortune for a product that wasn't any good in the UK. Obviously I need to do more research....
3.0,"I have had 3 of these edgers over the past 20 years.  They are excellent at edging and trenching.  The motor lasts around 6-7 years of heavy edging for me.  Unfortunately, this purchase is a newer model with bad ergonomic deprovements (made up word).  The prior design used a bolt on large ""helper"" handle that sat high on the trigger handle so you could control the unit with leverage from your left hand (thank Archimedes).  The ""improved""  handle is now one piece molded with a small knob (200% smaller than the old helper handle) to hold with your left hand. You can't get good leverage and you have to bend over further- a real back breaker.

It's disappointing when a 5-star product is improved to a 3-star product."
4.0,"I bought this to replace an older model that stopped working.  This one, as others have noted, is lighter in weight and construction.  It does a good job of edging the lawn, however, just as efficiently as the older one.  I'm giving it four stars only because it will take time to find out if it holds up as well as the older, more robust model."
5.0,"Good product, shipped quickly.  Thanks"
5.0,This produce did as i expected.
5.0,"Anyone that has a Wisteria bush needs one of these!  Its fast, convienent and makes an otherwise tedious job fun!
Its important to note the double switch turn on mechanism has a tough spring load preventing accidental turn  on and mis-use by younger children.
An extremelty important safety  feature with heavy, sharp cordless tools.
I love it!"
3.0,This would be great for small jobs. The only fault is the charge only permits approx. 35 mins. use.
3.0,Second one I have owned.  When they are working they do well but they don't appear to be the most durable thing Black and Decker ever made.  Definitely a home owner light duty tool.
5.0,Works great
5.0,No comment!
5.0,Really love this product.  Works and does a great job.
3.0,Hope this new one lasts longer than my old one just like it that burnt up the motor 2days ago
5.0,Works well.  Definitely not under powered.
1.0,I bought  A black and Decker Lawn hog edger and trencher this edger was for use in Ireland but its the wrong voltage so I cannot use it I have tried everyplace for transformer but cannot source one I wanted to return it but carriage was $375 from Ireland so this was a complete waste of money I think I should have been warned that it was not suitable  for Irish voltage The item was what I needed i wanted to return it but Amazon will not pay for return carriage I would have thought when Amazon did not warn me that me that it was not compatable with Irish voltage they should accept the price of the return
3.0,"It does edge but with the door covering the blade, it fills up fast with dirt and grass until it jams and must be ooened up to clean it out. Lots of busy work using this.  I tried removing the outer door and it was not much better.  It took me 3 hours to do what my neighbor came over and did with a gas stick edger.  Perhaps this is simply underpowered....."
5.0,The product works great for small yard.  You'll need a long extension cable for big yards.  Do it when the ground is not too wet or too dry.
5.0,Works as expected.
5.0,Awesome tool for small jobs around the yard. Reasonable battery life between charges
5.0,"This Black & Decker hand-held clipper gets charged by me in the kitchen and I'm easily able to hold it while on my knees, to clip grass along the house and fence.  I always use clippers or weed eaters that use battery rather than an electric cord.  I'm in my sixties so I appreciate a light weight easy tool for clipping weeds in my yard and keeping everything looking nice and neat."
5.0,Ordered for mom and she loves this trimmer.
5.0,It is performing as advertized/
5.0,Delighted to have found this again - had my other one for years - needed a new one and it is wonderful. Thanks.
4.0,love it...works great on weeds in tight places
5.0,"my mother in law uses this around the house , she is 89"
5.0,The clippers work just fine. They keep a charge good. Last a long time trimming.
5.0,Had one before that died. Found the exact replacement on Amazon. Thanks!
5.0,Great and I love it
5.0,great product
5.0,Great product
5.0,Love this item. It certainly cuts down on the time I spend trimming! Don't quite understand why they would discontinue!
4.0,Very good for clipping.  As other reviews stated it is a little big for my hand to hold the lock and starter.
5.0,"This little clipper is great. It is easy to handle, lightweight and does a great job. This is the third one I've had and I'm sorry to see Black & Decker has stopped making them. I have their new model that offers two blades, one to do bushes. But this one is much handier for a woman. Not many lawn items are woman friendly. But this one is!"
5.0,"I BUY TWO EACH YEAR TO KEEP MY WIFE HAPPY; THE BLADES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE, SO I BUY NEW."
5.0,"Love it, so glad I got it before they were all sold out. Use it everyday for just about everything, grass-bushes you name it!"
3.0,Comes with underpowered battery pack. Room for size C replacement but you'll have to make it yourself.
5.0,It's perfect for what I needed it for!
4.0,It works good.  The only thing I don't like is I have to keep pushing the on button to keep it going.
5.0,It works well. Very pleased.
5.0,Neighbors just hate this because im dominating them with it!
2.0,not a good addition.  does not work well after only a few uses.  B&D is usually a good buy but not this one
5.0,"This little dude is super powerful! I really put it to the test for its first use by edging my overgrown sidewalks. It does well around wide rounded edges and is pretty straightforward right out of the box. Because it is so light, I had no problem balancing it on the front wheel and only one back wheel while edging on the curb side. Other people said to just run the edger on the grass when edging by the curb but I found that more difficult than just keeping it balanced. You really can't beat this product's performance, especially given the inexpensive price point. Highly recommend!"
5.0,good buy
1.0,"Mine arrived appeared to be used. Returning it, hoping to get a New One."
5.0,Awesome edger! Did the trenching job around my flower garden in about ten minutes! It does have quite a kick when you first start it up so be careful of that initial cut! But I'm 68 and had no problem handling it. It also was very easy to assemble. Sturdy and powerful.
1.0,"It did a good job for the summer, good not great. It was difficult to control on the edge of the sidewalk, resulting in less then perfect cuts. It had a hard time cutting the thick grass, and, when the sidewalk has a chink missing, it would not catch the grass growing through that kink...
The guide broke after two month. it has a plastic part inside that just gave up. It didn't even last one summer.... That makes it very expensive in my book.
I tried to fix it, but to no avail... of course it is outside of the warranty... Don't buy this thing."
5.0,this thing is tough and edges the yard to a pro level
5.0,Great edger!
2.0,"I can see why discontinued, Weak clippers, with small clipper head with poor power"
2.0,The power is very low.  I used to own one that died.  I remember it as being much more powerful.  I wanted to shape a pom pom topiary.
3.0,"Worked great at first, dulls too quickly after that (although, at times got stuck on metal fencing around garden while clearing weeks & grass certainly didn't help).  Also, seemed to take a charge longer at the start, and then later it appeared not to get enough charge out of ea. use.  Average at best, which is what I about expected."
5.0,outstanding tool .
2.0,"Very Disappointed with the life of the Charger.  My old one lasted much longer.  I only got 2 season's if that out of the life of the charger, very disappointed."
2.0,Very disappointed in the low voltage and will not cut through heavy grass as my older 6 volt will. The 3.6 volt will stall out so i just use half the width of shear and then I'll switch to a pair just plain old scissors to get the job completed.
2.0,not powerful enough to go through a handful of grass. Good for deadheading one flower stalk at a time. Going to order the more expensive one.  You get what you pay for.
5.0,"This grass clipper was exactly what I was looking for. I owned one for many years, but the re-charger no longer worked so I needed a new one. It arrived on time & in perfect condition!"
5.0,Works great; replaced old one.
5.0,Love it just like my old one. Item was in perfect condition.
5.0,"works fine and easy to assemble. no gas or oil required, which is great."
5.0,"Have not used it as a trencher, but as an edger works great."
5.0,Works great! I'm very happy with it.
5.0,"This edger is great! It's easy to operate and will dig a deep, deep trench if you're not careful. I used my rechargable Ryobi weedeater as an edger, but the results have never been great or accurate. I've definitely left some creative ""edges"" on my lawn with the string trimmer. A dedicated edger makes a world of difference. Easy to use, point and pull the trigger. Hitting your sidewalk once or twice will teach you to DON'T DO THAT very quickly, via the magic of horrible, horrible grinding sounds. Replacement blades are inexpensive, I think around $8, so pick one or two up to go with it and you'll probably be good to go for years if you're a homeowner like me. Meaning yardwork is something that sucks your weekends dry of fun and is to be loathed and postponed until the last possible minute. I imagine that if you're a lawn-care professional, or just an obsessive lawn-care geek (they exist) this might not be adequate -- but then again, you'd probably already have an edger."
5.0,Great
4.0,First unit purchased had a bad switch. Only worked for ~30 minutes then wouldn't turn on. Returned and got a new one and it works perfectly. Very good unit for the price.
5.0,"Just got one of these today, it was my first time using one. I was looking at renting an edger but after looking at the price this would pay for itself after 2 uses. It did great, cut with minimal effort, work done fast. Assembly was a little tricky, the cords did not want to go into the handle to bolt it together. install the top section first then attach that to the bottom. Great clean cut.

over all I wold HIGHLY recommend this edger"
2.0,"My previous Edge Hog lasted over 9 years.  I changed the blade 4 times over its lifespan (once every 1.5 to 2 years) to renew its cutting ability, and it kept working well.  Unfortunately, it finally died last spring.  Maybe ""died"" isn't the right word.  The motor was still going strong, but it was actually the plastic handle that broke off.  Since it was so old at that point, I decided to buy a new edger instead of going on a hunt for a part for a discontinued model.

I decided to purchase another Edge Hog since I had been very happy with the last one, and so I bought this LE750 model.  As soon as I opened the box I could tell this new version had a cheaper build quality to it.  The plastic housing and handles are thinner and feel much cheaper.  The blade guard is now fixed position.  The old model had an blade guard that could be opened on a hinge to help quickly clear out clogs and to make cleaning easier at the end of the yard work session.

I started using the edger and noticed that the motor seemed a bit underpowered compared with the old version of this model, even though my old edger was close to a decade old.  Still, it did a reasonably good job of edging along my ~300ft of driveway, sidewalk, and road.  If the ground was moist the blade guard would get clogged up and was predictably not as easy to keep clean without the ability to open it.  Otherwise, the edger was OK.  Until today, that is.  I brought it out to use for maybe the 20th time in the 12 months I've owned it. I got through about 10 feet of edging and then the motor started running at maybe half its usual power.  I turned it off and waited a few minutes and tried again, but now it was running around 10 RPM and started giving off a burning smell.  I turned it off again and took the blade off just to make sure nothing was binding the shaft, but there wasn't anything there.  I plugged it back in and turned it on and nothing happened besides a burning smell emanating from the motor.

So the old Edge Hog motor was still going strong after almost a decade and 4 blade changes.  This new model's motor burned up after 1 year and maybe 20 edging sessions.  It didn't even make it through its first blade."
5.0,"I love this edger.  I have a gas edger that is always hard to start, always needing work and even though it did a great job my hands were numb by the time I finished.  I didn't have much to edge so I bought this electric edger.  It's so wonderful!!!  It took a little to get used to the light weight but I wish I had ordered it a few years ago."
5.0,"Very easy to assemble and requires no tools! I edged a brand new lawn (meaning it had to remove a lot of roots and dirt on the first pass) with this bad boy with no issues at all. The adjustable depth came in handy as my driveway had a bit of form leakage where I needed to make a more shallow cut in a few places. The edger is very maneuverable on straight lines but struggles a bit on tight curves due to the blade hitting the concrete (any bladed edger will have this issue). I do agree with other reviewers that the handles height should be more adjustable as it is low and requires you to lean over a bit to wield it comfortably (for reference I am 6').

Pros:
No Gas
No String
Cuts Cleanly
Adjustable Height
Blade replacements are relatively cheap (6-7 here on amazon)
Very cost effective

Cons:
Not battery operated! I would pay 2-3x the cost for a battery powered option
Handle is not height adjustable and is rather low

Conclusion:
I'm incredibly satisfied with this edger as it worked perfectly without hitches. I would love to see a battery powered variant, improved ergonomics on the handle and possibly a ""second"" independently adjustable guard in front of the blade to help with curves and dulling blades. My neighbor ordered one after seeing mine in action for the first time."
5.0,"This is like the Timex watch hat takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Superior product. I have several placed in strategic areas around the yeard, so as to not over extend any one unit during trimming time. I'd buy several more again!"
3.0,run out fast
5.0,Best grass shear ever
4.0,My husband isn't around to ask but it was for him and he seems/seemed happy with it.  He's used it a good bit already.
5.0,"My father loves it, perfect for small works."
5.0,Item as described. Thanks!
4.0,The battery life is very good.  It is good for small jobs.
5.0,"love this grass shear, sorry to hear that B & D discontinued it"
1.0,This shear is complete junk. I can't see how it got any good reviews. ypu can barely cut hot butter with this tool. I would Not recommend this tool to anyone.
1.0,"Rechargeable battery will only hold a charge for 3 to 5 years. Then you have to have it replaced at an authorized Black and Decker Service Center. They quoted me $46 to replace the battery (I paid $55 for the shears three years ago).

I called Black and Decker and found out that they ""sometimes"" use internal batteries to ""keep the price down.""

And, to make it worse, you are not supposed to dispose of the shears until the lithium battery is removed, which can only be done at an authorized service center. Of course, you know the service center will replace the battery and then resell the item. Black and Decker suggested that I take the shears to Home Depot or to my local recycling facility to dispose of them.

Amazon should post this as part of its description of the product, something like: Warning, product life only 3 to 5 years.  Unfortunately, it is on the instructions inside the box, which I didn't read until the battery would no longer hold a charge.

And here's the funny part. The blades can easily be replaced following the enclosed instructions and cost only $9.99 on Amazon."
5.0,Unit has been discontinued be B&D and my wife loves them was surprised to still to still be able to get them online
5.0,very good trimer
5.0,"It was exactly what I was looking for and could not find in a store anywhere.  Thanks for making it possible for me to have pretty
gardens!!"
4.0,We are very disappointed that these shears are being discontinued.  Our only complaint is that after a year or so the shears don't hold a charge long enough to finish the job.  Perhaps that explains the discontinuation.
5.0,"Best model I have had over many years, bar none, all makes and models considered. B&D is making a mistake discontinuing this model."
2.0,"Overall this Black & Decker cordless grass shear is a disappointing product. It does a fairly good job of cutting, but it takes too long (16 hours) to fully charge the battery, and it seems that the product is not built with longevity in mind. I bought my shear on June 7, 2009. I only used it a few times each summer and I maintained it very well. I cleaned it after each use, and I oiled the blades before winter storage. But on May 18, 2014, the locking button broke, and I could not turn off the shear. I had to use it until the batterys charge wore out. I have not been able to use the shear since then. It will not turn on."
5.0,Happy to find this product as it has been discontinued.  This particular shear is wonderful for close up work around cement objects and similar lawn items.
4.0,"I like this product, and with the extension handle I find it much easier to handle than a weed whacker.  The only drawback is they only seem to last a season or two, there is nowhere to get them repaired, and if you try to replace the rechargeable battery, it breaks the case.  And every couple of years they are totally redesigned--usually making them bigger, rather than more compact--and the new model is no longer compatible with the extension handle."
2.0,I bought this for edging small areas.  It works fine....for about 5 minutes after full charge.  Don't waste your money.
3.0,"It does light grass trimming well, but the batteries die after two seasons and the blades get dull after one season. Changing batteries is not easy, and it's fairly expensive. But, this is a pretty good tool to trim areas that the lawn mower can't reach. Just don't get too attached to them; they'll leave you by late next summer."
5.0,Fantastic! Plenty of torque and easy to guide. First mow of the season and it took me less than half the time to edge than I expected. Was using 4-cycle gas edger but this one is better by far.
5.0,Works great and has a trencher mode. Great for electrical wire burial...
1.0,"lasted 1.5 seasons. I bought this on 7/22/2015 for 2 postage stamp front lawns 10'x10' in size.
Used it though the 2016 season worked well.
plugged it in to start the 2017 season and it would not turn on.
Should last longer than 1.5 seasons. ."
5.0,"I bought the Edge Hog, primarily, for burying light-gauge wires that radiate from the base of an amateur radio antenna and improve the signal quality.  The first few runs of wire, 20 to 30 feet each, we're buried by ""scratching"" the lawn surface with a small hand tool.  It took a couple hours to complete those initial runs.  With the Edge Hog, however, the remaining 8 or 10 runs were cut in just a few minutes, the lines were straight and the depth of cut was consistent.  It eliminated a lot of labor intensive work and now I also have a great edger for use on walkways and other trim spots around the yard.  Can't beat the price either.  Highly recommended for edging and light trenching."
4.0,"The only reason I am rating it a 4 Star is because prior to use, my husband had to edge all the lawn manually which took countless hours.  After doing the prior edging by hand, it is easy to maintain with the edger and only takes a few minutes."
5.0,I've been using a normal weed eater as an edger till it stopped working so well on my thick grass. This thing is amazing! I only wish I would have got this sooner!
5.0,It does a good job!
5.0,"THIS is what the hubs put together, and edged the front yard and it looks manicured!"
5.0,Works great.  Good for small to medium yards since you need to use a cord.
5.0,works great
2.0,OK for piddlers.  This would be hard to use for weak-handed people or those who want some production.  Not a good choice.
4.0,"Black & Decker grass shears is a good investment. The 3 inch blade was not my first choice.but at the time of purchase I did not know about the 4 inch blade. However, I like the features. Easy handling & a good grip. Now with 2 shears my grass trimming is a breeze."
5.0,Really enjoy the outcome of the trimming when I use this item. I have little to no clippings in areas that I do not wish to have grass in.
2.0,"This tool does not have the cutting power to do the job.  It is a good tool to trim the grass edges, or thin plant leaves.  But it absolutely will not cut dead flower stems.  I regret having invested in this product.  I will purchase a larger corded model."
5.0,I love these shears.  I have been using this handy tool for trimming where my mower can't go for many years.  The battery life will usually poop out after 3 summers.  So I order a new one.  I was devastated when I couldn't find this tool in the stores anywhere in my community a few years ago.  So I went to my favorite to go place (amazon) and was delighted to find it.  I hope Black & Decker never quits offering these shears.
5.0,"very satisfied
also have the extension handle which is great
wish I had ordered it sooner

recommended to all my friends"
5.0,"Bought to of these from the seller, both are still in excellent working condition, I should have bought a couple more.  Fast delivery, my wife loves it for easy handling for cutting grass in hard to get areas."
5.0,Had the same cordless grass shear for almost 8 years.....work well until the last 60 days; hope this one does just as well!
5.0,"I had one of these for years until it ""finally"" wore out.  It's an excellent grass shear with good battery power.  I certainly would recommend it to anyone."
4.0,does a great Job for the light clipping I use it for. ..might not do so hot for heavy duty work though
3.0,Was disappointed with the quality of this product.  The  battery charger plug is made of plastic and does not seem it would provide reliable service after using for any length of time.  Thought price was high for the way it is made.  Disappointed the handle had to be purchased separately.  Would not recommend this product.
5.0,Does exactly what I needed it to do.  trims around plants and edges along walkways. It's a good all around tool for the yard.
5.0,"The cordless shear was way better than trying to clip the grass around flowers that are not separated by a lot of space.
A ""weed whacker"" is great for open spaces but to get close to wire fences and close to flowers and plants you need something smaller and the B&D cordless shear does the job."
5.0,This product has met and exceeded all expectations.  It was shipped in 2 days and it is easy for my wife to use.
4.0,"yes i do like my black & decker grass trimmer.

yes i would recommend it to a friend.

and i also enjoyed the nice service and quickness from amazon.  thank you all so much.

i do like it."
4.0,"Does a nice job and the charge is sufficient for medium type jobs. If the grass is tall and thick it will struggle. Overall, good purchase for the money!"
1.0,"The bad news is that these shears are tremendously underpowered. If what you're trying to cut has any thickness (in terms of many blades of grass, not thick stems ... tho that would be bad too), you'll struggle and struggle with this gadget to make any progress at all.

The blades are not incredibly sharp, so you'll be going over each area in multiple passes to get everything.

The power button, a two stage affair if you are using the optional long handle, is difficult to engage, and the slightest slip and it is back off again.

The good news is that the charge doesn't last long on the battery, so you won't be suffering and cursing this thing for very long in each session.

Avoid this and just get a good string trimmer."
4.0,I wanted these shears for cutting thin grass and weeds close to my permanent structures around the house. It allows me to do detail work that my other weed trimmer is too big for. It does exactly what I expected it to do.
3.0,"It works So So, It seems to get slower as you use it?  It cuts grass around poles good.  Wouldn't buy another, would rather use the old hand clippers."
5.0,I love the grip. The newer model is difficult to hold and operate. ( I sold mine after the first use.) The battery charge lasts long enough to get everything done is a very large yard.
4.0,Works great. Cut right through my shoe.
4.0,AAA OK!!!!
4.0,"The earrings are fine but not as large as I thought they would be.  I believe it is an earring around 12cm I am looking for!  Also, I have been looking for oval turquoise earrings about 10cm in size but cannot find any.  I did have a pair of turquoise earrings which I lost but unfortunately the back of one was pulled off so now I only have the one!"
5.0,"works well, edged gardens and trimmed lots of ivy, will see how long it holds up."
5.0,I love this edger. It is so easy to maneuver. Great purchase and it arrived on time.
5.0,"Love, love, love this! Easy to use - and it's fun. Like a circular saw on a stick. I use it to edge my driveway, sidewalk, and flower beds. So glad I bought this - have had no problems with it, and the landscaping looks so much better since I bought this. The first time takes a bit longer, if you have spend years without edging, like I had. But after that it's quick and easy to spruce up the edging, and it's easy on the back - no bending except to retrieve the bits and pieces that you trim off. I use it several times a summer. Highly recommend."
3.0,Came broken swapped out for a new one though and has been working great
5.0,Fast shipping and works great.
4.0,Not very easy to use in tight areas.
5.0,Excellent product  .  I recommend  for everything
5.0,"Great tool for clipping, trimming or cutting.  So easy and cordless too. Charges quickly, handles great.  Makes light work of a tedious job."
1.0,"I used this trimmer once or twice at the end of the season last year. Unfortunately the trimmer does not take a charge any longer. I attempted to do a little trimming this spring and found that the trimmer operated VERY slowly and not for long. It would not cut anything even the slightest bit tough and barely cut grass for only a few minutes. I'm sure that Black and Decker must be aware of the shortcomings of their re-chargeable batteries, yet they continue to market these products without improvement. I had an older trimmer very similar to this model that pooped out as well. I took the chance that B&D had improved their product...didn't happen. Save your money!"
3.0,"There are batteries available, just google enough to find them. But replacing them requires heart surgery. So I bought a new one. They work and it is a habit to have one."
5.0,Mother loves it; easy to use.
4.0,"The B&D grass shear is avast impovement over the scissors I have been using. My only complaint is the short battery life. I would recommend buying the one with a longer life battery. Even though it is quite a bit more expensive, the ability to complete the job without having to recharge would be more tan worth it."
2.0,THIS ONE SOMETHING HAPPENED IN DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING. IT HOLDS VERY LIMITED CHARGE AND REALLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ANY OUTDOOR PROJECT. USED TWICE AND SITTING IN THE YARD SALE BOX.
5.0,Works great. Just what I needed to trim grass around other tender plants where a line trimmer would destroy the plants.
2.0,"Seems cheaply made, it is hard to hold back the safety switch & push the button to operate the shears.  I don't use shears often, so will muddle through.  Not as good as my last pair, they were another brand."
5.0,My wife and I have used this at least ten times since we received it.  It is great and we love it.
1.0,Have had grass shears for years including black & decker this unit would not cut grass very disappointing! The grass would just  pass through the blades and would not even rip the grass. Bought another brand and did just fine.
4.0,very good
4.0,It is a good deal for the price.  I  find it unwieldy on the  street edge.
5.0,"Received the edger but it is now winter here so I cannot try it out yet.  Will update review in a couple of months when I am able to use it outside.  As far as receiving it, all I had to do was to install two bolts to put the hancle on the edger.  The ease to adjust depth of edging looks very easy to do.  I did plug it in my shop to try it out and it powered up nicely."
5.0,Good product.  Makes the sidewalk edges neat
5.0,Difficult for senior citizen but does a good job
5.0,Great edger!!  Have used Black and Decker products for a long time.  Very dependable.
5.0,Great Edger and comparably priced. Hubby loves it. Thanks!
4.0,Works great so far. I don't expect to last past 3 years though.
5.0,I've had this for a while now and it's done great. It's a little short if you are a tall person but it edges right along like a champ. The yard hadn't been edged in a long time so the initial cut took a little bit more work but after that it's fairly simple to breeze along and trim the edging. I was worried that being electric it might not be powerful enough but it's had no problems with normal edging.
5.0,Works perfectly does a great job on my lawn
5.0,I purchased this as a backup for when my existing trimmer finally dies.  I don't know what I'll do when/if this product is no longer available!
4.0,It is fine.  Works well.  The draw back is that there is a plug in the back that lets you put an extention pole on the product.  It won't stay closed.
4.0,"A little nervous to purchase used, but they have been fantastic. I can get my weeding done akk in one charge. They arrived within 5 days."
2.0,"Was impressed with item, seemed well made and durable.  However, charged the battery for the required time, and it just held charge for approximately 10 min.  Tried it several times and finally gave up and returned item.  According to instructions, charge should last for at least 30 min."
5.0,"I had one of these for many years and when I finally bent the blades and the battery was worn out, I never got around to getting another one and I'm glad I did.  This is one of the handiest tools in my garage.  You can leave this hooked up to the charger cord all the time and grab it when needed.  I use this to trim ivy away from the base of my roses and trees, to trim spots along the edges and for light trimming.  It will stick and stop on anything much thicker than grass or ivy, but I've gotten used to just putting the blades flat against the ground and pulling the trimmer backwards sliding the blades on the ground.  That immediately dislodges most everything.  I take this out at least once a week to obliterate a weed or clean stuff up.  When this one gets near the end of its life, I'll get another one before it goes."
4.0,My Craftsman cordless grass shear broke.  Since I didn't get good customer service on the Craftsman I decided to go with a different brand.  Black and Decker was less expensive and works just as good.  I'd recommend this.
2.0,"I bought these several years ago to replace an earlier iteration of this item that actually WORKED (you can tell the earlier version, which used to be green, rather than orange).  The battery dies on these very quickly so even my tiny front lawn takes two days (one overnight charge) to cut; the old version was good for the entire yard.  I really wish I could find some grass clipper version of my electric (corded) hedge clipper, which works a treat."
5.0,"Puchased this Black & Decker cordless grass shear because the one I
had had for many years was worn out. Really got my money's worth +.
This new one works very well, just like my last one.  However my
only complaint is that with my last one I was able to take out the batteries and charge them.  I had four sets of batteries so I always
had the use of them.
Unfortunately the battery in this new one doesn't come out and it is suggested that should I need a new battery I would have to send it back to the company where they would replace it.
You can figure out the rest of the story.
However for right now I am very happy with my purchase and I will continue using it.
Its very handy for trims on my bushes, lawn edging etc.
Love it!
I received this within a few days of placing my order.
I would do the same thing again.
Margaret NJ."
5.0,This is a super little grass trimmer for small spots you don't want to get out a mower for. I love mine and they work super.
3.0,"Nice item for the price. Uncomfortable on the hand when working with it, triggers are hard to hold in. Good for small jobs."
1.0,"""Very Disappointed"" first of all the cord didn't work right and it barely holds a charge and does ""not"" cut very well.  I have weeds that I was hoping it would cut they aren't thick but it does ""not"" do the job.  I am very unhappy with this product and it is sitting on my shelf.  I will just use my clippers and do it manually as this product is not something I would purchase again."
1.0,"This is the worst piece of gardening tool I've ever bought.  You can only trim a 10 inch area before you finger starts cramping up. The safety lock has such a small hold you have to push, in order to pull the trigger, so its not like you can just turn it off and rest your fingers, you have to go through trying to push that little hold and then at the same time pull in this trigger that's so stiff and hard to keep in its ridiculous.  Then to change the blade, another horrible design, you have to balance this blade while trying to get the top part on and aligned with these little cheap prongs made out of cheap plastic.  I've even written them and the company's customer service sucked. I gave them one star only because they make you put something in , I don't think it even deserved that.  There is one made by craftsman that was great and then they quit selling it, now I see one just like it made by American Gardener*****Do Not Buy Black and Decker*****"
5.0,"Good product, works as advertised.  After several years of weekly use, the batteries in my first one started to wear out (reduced working time), so I bought another one.  That's the best endorsement I can give!  Tips:  Try to run the batteries completely down before recharging (they're NiCads), and replace the blades once in a while for top performance."
5.0,"I've been using one of these for years, they do an excellent job, I came to Amazon to fine one, since the major home stores stopped carrying this peticular item, in fact I ordered two from you so they would last me for a few years.  Would recommend this product to anyone. Amazon, was great to do business with, they shipped when they said they would and have made a customer out of me...Thank you Amazon.
Sue"
3.0,"This unit functions all right.  However, the quality, ease of use, and ""fit"" for my hand is definitely NOT the Black and Decker quality I had in my original set which have unfortunately gone missing!  This unit is mostly a two-handed operation for me to keep it running.  But it does beat the old-fashioned, non-electric model grass clippers I used in the past."
4.0,"I agree with the customers who say you get what you pay for with this item.  It is not very good for taller or wet grass, but for keeping shorter grass trimmed I find it works fine.  Since this is what I use it for, I do not have to go beyond about 25-30 minutes at a clip (sorry about that), so battery length has not been a problem.  If you have a large yard or plan to trim only when the grass gets longer, I would look elsewhere for a heavier duty machine.  If you are looking for relatively light duties, this one works fine."
3.0,"I was disappointed in the life of the battery. After less than a year, I had to take the shears to a repair depot to have the battery replaced. Now, again, the unit is not functionable because the battery is dead."
1.0,This didn't work at all.  It wouldn't even cut my grass. Holds about a 5 minute charge.
4.0,A great product at a great price.  Excellent for those small places around bushes and trees
2.0,"The product work well, but the problem is the short time of battery, only 30 minutes and need 16 hours to charge."
5.0,Nice
5.0,"Less maintenance than a gas machine, and much more powerful than the wimpy Ryobi 40 volt system I tried and regretted. Very satisfied."
5.0,Works great.....exactly as advertised.
5.0,Second one first one just wore out. That's why I bought a second one. I knew how good it works.
3.0,There has to be a more inexpensive way to purchase trimming string for this weedeater
5.0,"My parents have a gas powered edger because they have such a long driveway.  Luckily I don't have that problem and can use this guy.  Just as powerful and I don't have to change the oil, winterize it, etc."
4.0,"Surprisingly, for an electric chord-based outdoor piece of equipment, cuts well and is decently sturdy. Priced well too!"
5.0,The Edger by Black & Decker works great. I'm Satisfied with the product on how it works and performs.
4.0,It's 5 stars if it could trench right up to all corners and if it could easily cut around curves.  That is my reason for 4 stars
5.0,Arrived early and works great... love it!!!
5.0,This Black and Decker Grass Clipper is excellent for use along a flower bed where a weed wacker type tool is difficult to use because of lack of control.
1.0,"I agree wholeheartedly with all the other 1 & 2 star reviews. Do NOT understand the 3, 4 & 5 star reviews.  Not a female friendly product if there is a lot of clipping to do. You need strong fingers to keep the on/off switch depressed for any length of time. Keeps shutting off after the first sign of weakness in the fingers.  They cut the tips of grass fine but to get to the bottom of the blade you have to make at least 3-4 passes.  Not for the busy gardener. Cordless is wonderful -- recharges over night.  Thot Black and Decker would have a much better product than this thing.  Very disappointing. Am going back to American Gardener.  Don't buy this OR the long handle, for the same reasons already expressed by some."
1.0,"Worthless waste of money.  Trimmer jams at the faintest hint of thick grass.  Holds a charge long enough to cut about 15 feet of edging, then dies.  Won't run when plugged in so doesn't even work as a corded trimmer.  I use these to prop open the shed door so I can find the hand trimmers to actually edge my lawn."
1.0,"After only 2 summers of careful use, the blades got dull and the battery doesn't hold the charge. The replacement battery costs $15 plus S&H. Not buying any more tools from B&D. Instead, bought the American Garden cordless grass shear 4.8 Volt from Amazon. Very powerful, lighter than B&D, stainless steel blades. So far very happy with the new American Gardener's shear."
2.0,"These shears are helpful for grooming small areas when you don't want to drag out the gas trimmer, but they are really more of a toy than anything else. And I highly recommend the optional extension handle if you do find them worth keeping in your arsenal of equipment. But my biggest complaint with this B&D tool, and the reason I have sworn off ALL B&D cordless tools, is the poor battery lifespan and inability to replace the batteries (or if replaceable, it costs as much or more than replacing the tool at most discount sources). The batteries in this and the similar cordless hedge trimmer must be religiously recharged on a regular basis year round whether you use them or not. During the winter season if you start slipping on a weekly recharge, the batteries will die a slow but sure, premature death. The same is true of most cordless tools, but B&D's are the worst yet. That goes for drill/drivers, also. And while I'm ranting about B&D, I have to say the quality of their corded tools has deteriorated in recent years, too. Never again will I buy another B&D cordless or corded tool."
1.0,Terrible product.  Battery charge lasts only a few minutes.  Grass gets caught between blades and causes them to freeze-up and has to be pulled out by hand.  Complete waste of money.  Don't buy it.
5.0,"The grass shears works well.
The price was good.
I'm pleased with my purchase."
1.0,"Design is poor as it gives me a cramp to hold the safety button AND the power button at the same time. But I never have the cramp for long since the battery doesn't hold a charge worth a sou. After just a few minutes cutting the battery loses enough power that the blades won't cut through anything thicker than air. Now after just a couple of years of light use the battery is completely dead. No replacement batteries available anywhere except ""authorized repair"" shops. My guess is that it would cost as much to replace the batteries as it did to buy the shears in the first place. I'm sorry I bought these."
2.0,"While this is okay for light quick edging - it cuts through a reasonable thickness of grass & weeds - it is not easy turn on and keep on. The switch must be pushed forward and down with the thumb constantly in order to keep it on. Even in short bursts I still get a sore spot on the end of my thumb (forget about the ache in the knuckle). I have a friend with arthritus who can't even turn it on. My mom has an old one without the thumb safety switch and it is MUCH easier to use.
B&D, if you are reading this...PLEASE find a better switch. I've had mine for about 2 years and the already nasty switch is starting to go now. I have to jiggle it and adjust the pressure to get it to work at all."
5.0,Great for clipping around the yard. Stays charged for hours. Good buy and great shipping time.
2.0,"I ordered the grass shears to use around some roses and other areas that a lawn mower can't touch and a weed whacker could damage. The shears are very loud for an electric tool and they will stop cutting when they encounter any sort of thicker grass. It is actually easier and quicker to use a pair of large scissors or small manual shears than use this product. Good idea, but far from perfected yet. Not worth the money."
5.0,Somewhat bulky compared to pass models but does what I want and runs over 20 minutes.  I cut dead flowers twigs and do clean up hedge work with them.  Saves time and effort.  I do not understand negative comments about run time.  Runs long enough for my yard work.  Use it almost daily.
4.0,"PRIOR TO THIS PURCHASE, I HAD NEVER OWNED ELECTRIC GRASS SHEARS BUT, AFTER USING THIS GRASS SHEAR, I AM HOOKED! THIS GRASS SHEAR IS EASY TO USE, LIGHT WEIGHT, CUTS EVEN TOUGH WEEDS WITH EASE, NO CORD TO GET IN YOUR WAY, AND MADE BY A TRUSTED BRAND."
4.0,"I had owned this product before (without the long handle) so I knew that it would do the job.  I ordered it so my 86-year-old father could trim the grass with the long handle.  He hasn't complained and when I come home from work, the grass is trimmed.  His only comment was that it doesn't go for long periods of time without a recharge, but then I suspect he isn't going at marathon speed.  The final product, the trimmed edges, look very nice."
2.0,"This shear worked OK for about a year. I use it with the extension handle and you do have to have a strong hand to keep both triggers pressed to keep the unit running. Now after a year, a full charge only lasts about 5 minutes. It used to work 15-20 minutes on full charge. I would replace the battery, but there is no replacement available."
4.0,"I had purchased a handle and had to have this model to use handle.

Took quite a long time to arrive, but it is what I was looking for."
5.0,"I know that some poeple think a 45 minute charge is not enough however this is a trimmer not an edger. I have used the previous one with great success. It trims grass around sprinklers and places that a mower can't reach.
I hope that a replacement battery will be available when the present battery wears out."
1.0,"I bought this product, charged it up overnight and found it would not work after a single 3 second burst. I returned it, and bought two more, to be sure I could edge before company coming. After charging both overnight, one worked, but the other one stopped after 3 minutes and would not charge again. The THIRD appliance works fine and holds a charge. This is too much trouble to buy 3 to get only 1 that works."
1.0,"This product is difficult to use and is a joke.

Don't buy it."
5.0,I have tried several and this is the best one.  Most power and runs longer than other brands with one charge.
5.0,OK not for tall people
5.0,Easy to use.  Does a great job.
5.0,I just wish the 2 bolts that you insert into the arm what easier to install with the black cable running through the middle.
4.0,GOOD
4.0,Works great
5.0,works great
4.0,"Takes a bit getting use to, still adjusting to using it. May try a different type with a circular blade."
4.0,Was very pleased with the operation of this edger. It did a very good job.
4.0,Would buy again!
5.0,Works like a champ
5.0,I had difficulty ordering my replacement from another supplier.  It did not accomodate the features I needed to match those of my old one. Amazon came through.
4.0,It does exactly what I expected.  Good product.
5.0,"This is the second GS500 shear I've owned.  I couldn't find a replacement when my first one wore out, so I locally purchased the GS700 which I assumed was an improved version of the GS500.  Big mistake!  While I won't spend time on the GS700, I will say that it is completely unsatisfactory vis-a-vis the GS500.  After unexpectedly finding the GS500 on Amazon, I immediately ordered it and have been as happy with the second one as I was with the first.  In fact, I intend to order a replacement battery from Black and Decker while the batteries are still available so I can extend the life of my new GS500."
5.0,"I've had the cordless shears for several years, and I love them. I bought this pair for my daughter lest she steals mine. They are perfect for trimming around and under things I want to protect from string trimmers. (Trees and fences)."
4.0,"I had a cordless grass shear about 20 years ago.  I decided I was not happy with anything I found on the market today and thought to give this old product a try.  It did the trick, I am very pleased. I only wish the charge could last longer."
1.0,Poor blade quality means frequent jams. Limited run-time. Uncomfortable to operate with small to medium size hand. Save your money. This item deserves 0 stars.
5.0,Neat little device. To get near tree bottoms. Trim near borders around gardens and pool edging. I like it a lot. Would recomend it to anyone who has to finish a big job.
1.0,"You better have a strong thumb to keep the lock disengaged.

OK for very light grass trimming.

A full charge will last about 5 minutes.

I have not been able to find a replacement/rechargeble battery.

Don't buy it !!"
2.0,The old blades they use to make before 1998 for this unit were top quality and would last you like 50 yard cuttings.  The ones you pick up today only last like 8 yard cuttings before they get dull.  They are very hard to sharpen with a file or dremel tool.  I cannot get them to sharpen right so I'm forced to buy new blades often.  The battery life is avg 30 - 45 mins.
4.0,"Look at the voltage of this unit. It is 3.6 and that is the amount of power you can expect to get out of it. It may cut though grass, but only if you do not try to cut to much at one time. Otherwise Black and Decker brand has always held up good for me and I think it is a good product for the price."
4.0,"This is not a guys tool; however my wife loves it!  It trims extremely well and the battery charge holds every bit of a half hour if not longer.  It cuts through almost any type weed or grass with little or no resistance.  Ladies, put on your gloves and get a trimming!  :-)"
1.0,Was unable to use item since I have a bad back.  The extension handle was never set for this item.  I would not have ordered this item if I knew I would not get the extension handle.
5.0,"This Grass Shear is perfect for pruning and for mowing around flowers and shrubs! I use mine for mowing and weeding my flowerbeds - much faster and easier than pulling them by hand. Great for pruning small bushes and shrubs. Light and easy to use, quick charge lasts longer on mine than the promised 35 minutes. Black & Decker always makes a quality product.  Highly recommend!"
1.0,"These shears are way too feeble for any serious use. They cut the tender tips of the grass fine, but when it comes to the beefier, possibly wet, root area, they totally fail. The overload shutoff kicks in every 5 seconds, making them totally unusable for me. I tried to trim the overgrown edge of my lawn and I gave up after 6 feet. If you are a serious gardener and want a strong, reliable tool that does its job, this is not for you."
3.0,"I have used the clippers for many years and I want to replace the batteries. I have a GS300 clipper not the GS500 and would like to be able to order batteries to replace the ones that no longer will take a charge. How may I order new bateries for the GS300 grass clipper? Thank you, WL Bourgeois"
3.0,"I can't say that this is the best grass shear made.
When fully charged, it will run for about 30-45
minutes before the charge is lost.  It takes quite
a long time to charge this baby up.
The quality on the handheld unit it pretty good.  The
long-handle accessory is just fine also.  I don't like
the way they both connector together.  Seems like it could
be trouble over time.
We have a yard that is close to 3/4 of an acre, with lots
of flower beds, trees, and things to trim around. Honestly
this is not the unit for us, but my wife wanted a rechargeable,
and there are not many out there.
It works.  It gets the job done if you are patient.  But there
could be improvements made.
To get 5 stars, the battery life should be longer, quicker
to recharge, and the connector for the long handle should be
more secure."
4.0,All it needs is to recognize flowers from the weeds.
4.0,"The design of the previous model(s) of grass shears were all the same for  about 25 years. I know this because I have seen them in all sorts of  colors, but the design never changed. This newer model came out last year  and while it is a fine unit, it's a little bit more difficult to use. The  only problem is the lock-on button feature. For some reason a lot of  strength is needed to secure the lock. People with arthiritis, and joint  problems could have difficulties with this unit. I understand that this  model has an extension sold seprately, but better design is needed."
3.0,"This product is good for females, as it is light weight, and you have complete control over it at all times not like weed eaters that seem to overpower you. You don't need jeans, army boots and goggles just to use  this! I do have trouble with the on/off switch. Hard to keep the unit going  at all times. Keeps cutting off. Easy to recharge and a delight to have no  gasoline worries or electric cord worries."
5.0,"This is one of the handiest lawn gadgets to have. I love it for trimming and edging... especially hard to get to places that the lawn mower can't begin to reach. If you don't have time to mow the lawn... this little bit  of tidying up that you can accomplish with the trimmer is very helpful.  Plus, I think Black & Decker products are tops!"
5.0,"easy to use, works great"
5.0,"Nice and powerful, cuts nice swath through thick stuff on sidewalks.  Much better than my previous gas powered one."
5.0,Not an expensive or heavy duty unit but works well.  Has plenty of power for small yards.  I am glad I bought it.
5.0,I was skeptical but it gets the job done!
5.0,Very nice
5.0,Fantastic worth the money
5.0,"works fantastic, great value for the price"
5.0,"Husband likes this a lot. Saves him from the tedious task of pulling weeds next to and in-between the walkway concrete pads. Really takes care of the grass, even the Bermuda Grass that has the runners. So far he has only used it one time, but it worked very well."
5.0,Love the product.
5.0,Love this edger
2.0,"This was first designated edger.  Up to this point I had only used a hand edger or the one that was integrated with my weed waker, which was pretty weak and could not cut through the thicker growth areas.  I used this edger after weeks of growth on my lawn and it worked great! Was relatively easy to handle and maneuver and cut nice smooth edges in my bermuda grass. I was really impressed and satisfied at the outcome considering the price of the unit and short amount of time it took complete all the edging. That was late September, growth was slow there after I didn't really need to edge again until last week (November 19th).  After about 3 feet of work the motor started making this terrible rattling sound like parts hand come off and were being tossed around the interior case.  The blade continued to spin but I wasn't going to risk any further damage so I stopped.

I'm past the return window for Amazon so I'll look for a B&D service center to get it fixed.  This could have just been a bad unit but something to consider."
5.0,Very nice machine. Does a great job
5.0,Edges nice
2.0,Was not impressed.
3.0,"Fine for small area, but not rugged enough for my 300ft of sidewalk."
5.0,Lawn looks so much better clean edge lines
4.0,Works nice once you get the hang of it!
4.0,This thing is really great.  Actually works like they said it would.
5.0,I borrowed several different types and brands of edgers to test before choosing this one.  I bought this one because it was easiest to use and cut a deeper edge than the others.
5.0,"I have owned several of these over the years, not because they broke down, but because I gave them to friends because they work so well. Once you have done the edging, maintenance is a breeze."
5.0,we love this it is not heavy and we have a long cord it is easy for a lady to use
5.0,"First edger I have ever bought, and what a difference it makes to the look of my lawn!  I was waffling between this and a push edger, I am glad I went with this.  On the initial cutting of your trench this thing makes it easy, I imagine a push edger would take quite a bit of effort to do the first dig.  The edge hog has quite a bit of power as well, here in New Mexico our soil tends toward clay with rocks in, this tore through that no problem.  Go for the powered version, you won't be disappointed!"
5.0,Works great at edging along my walkway and curb. Great item.
4.0,"This is my second Edge Hog I have owned.  The first unit lasted over 10 years.
Got sick of 2-stroke engines.  A round 75-foot power cord with a crank spool make it easier to manage.  If you use a flat power cord they tend to tangle.
Also I use Sears replacement blades - much cheaper."
3.0,It takes more skill than I thought to edge my driveway with zoysia grass.
5.0,"This replaced a gas powered Ryobi unit that i had.  I was skeptical that it would do the job, but trusted the reviews and am glad I did.  This did the job in 1/3 of the time that the gas powered unit did.  Including the time it took me to unwrap and rewrap the electrical cord.  Wish I'd bought this years ago."
5.0,Great price for Black & Decker!
5.0,Still use this after a year.
5.0,"great unit, have gotten lots of use.  would buy again"
4.0,Works great.
5.0,Husband can't wait to use this gift!!!
3.0,I would actually give this 2-1/2 stars if tha was an option. If you have a small area to edge and are on a tight budget this will do but otherwise I do not recommend it. I edge every week and this edger requires going back and forth several times to get a clean edge. It's simply not a very good edger.
5.0,Work great for me when I edged my sidewalk  and parking slab.
4.0,only used once. Does a good job so far.
4.0,Worked good and was easy to use.  I'm happy with it and it saved me a bunch of time when putting in an underground fence.
2.0,This is okay.  Not really what I thought it was.  I'm doing my edges by hand with another had tool.
2.0,not easy to use and very poor for trim edge
4.0,As expected good edger for the money
5.0,"Awesome edger.  Good price.  Good job.  Would definitely buy it again.  My patio, sidewalk, driveway etc. look so much better.  There is a guide that rides next to the cement to protect that blade works really well.  No complaints at all!"
4.0,Clogs up often when edging areas that have not been maintained. Lots of power to chew through thick grass weeds and dirt. Doesn't clog if you edge regularly.
4.0,"Having never owned an edger before I was able to judge this unit on how it performed, not how it performed when compared to something else.  This unit worked very well.  I had heavy weeds on the edge of my lawn that required me to run the unit back and forth several times to complete the edge but that didn't seem to be all that hard. Once I got started and comfortable with it, I was able to edge over 200 linear feet in under 30 minutes. I thought it was easy to adjust the blade guide and depth of cut as well. The wheels make it easy to maneuver but it definitely needs a flat surface to make it work best. Mounded edges are a problem. It can be hard to see the edge of a curvy concrete drive when heavily overgrown so the blade can easily hit the concrete edge if you try to go too fast. Safety glasses are recommended.
The only significant CON for me is that the unit is pretty low to the ground. I wish the handle would adjust for a taller person.  I'm 6'2"" tall and had to bend over the whole time to use it.
Overall its a great machine with lots of power.  I doubt anyone could talk me into spending 3-4X as much for a gas powered machine."
3.0,No directions for use and no set arrow for depth adjustment
5.0,"An electric, plug-in to trim the edge of a lawn, and that it does as well as the operator allows it to.  Easy to handle, cuts right-handed (guide wheels on left), and blades which propel diggings to the front of the pathway."
5.0,So far so good....only used once so hopefully it will last until next season we probably only have to use it 1 or 2 more times this season.
5.0,exactly what I wanted
5.0,"It's just what we needed for trimming around our stepping stones, road, flower beds, etc.  Works well.  Just have to be careful not to cut the cord :}"
3.0,"Edger works good, I purchased this item on 10/4/16 with the expectation of receiving a $10 rebate within the eligible window of 10/1/16 thru 10/15/16 if bought and shipped through amazon. The offer has since been taken down. I have contacted amazon and black & decker for my rebate. They can not seem to find the offer. I'm sadden by both parties involved."
5.0,Great
4.0,A little loud but has a lot of power. Works really good.
5.0,"Loooooove it! It was a bit of a learning curve, but now my edges look great! I'm extremely happy with the results."
5.0,My son borrowed it and liked it so well that I bought him one for his birthday. He gave his old one away.
5.0,Works great. My driveway is appx. 200 ft. long and had never been edged. I did it in about an hour. Stopping often to sweep and allow the machine to cool.
5.0,This works great! Should have ordered one a long time ago.
4.0,Work great
1.0,"Broke in less than 2 months...or about 6 uses.  Took things nice and slow the first few times to establish a good edge.

Now I'm out $89."
2.0,"After using this product for a few months, I have found myself quite disappointed with the product. Since the product is so lightweight, it tips over easily. This makes it difficult for me to trim edges that are not on a completely flat and level surface. The product does work well, but it is quite frustrating to find myself constantly fighting to keep the tool level so it doesn't tip over on its side as I push it along the edge of my sidewalk."
5.0,As advertised
5.0,"This is so easy to use and cuts really well.  It's loud, like most B&D products, but a great buy for the price.  Very happy."
4.0,WORKS GOOD
3.0,This product did not work as good for me. I had a faster and cleaner time using a hand held grass edger shovel. Great customer service
5.0,Works like a champ.
3.0,you can tell that this thing may break at any minute but for the price its great plus it got the job done...not broken yet after three uses
1.0,"Update July 2017
I used this item twice on 2016, and it worked great.
I tried using it once in June 2017, and the thing died on me.
The blade no longer turns.
I hear an electric noise every time I press the engage button.
But that's it.
Dead after only three uses.
Disappointed.
________________________

The easiest way to improve your front lawn.
The unit comes almost fully assembled.
Instructions are pretty clear.

If you don't know how to use it, YouTube has simple tutorials that I used.

Make sure to take the time to check for rocks, wires, that will come out flying if you're not careful.
Wear long pants and eye protection.
Move your vehicles away from front and behind of the area where you're using it. This is because any solid objects that come into contact, as the blade spins, can fly out towards your vehicle.

Once you're finished using it, your lawn has a nice sharp cut/edge that makes everything look really good."
5.0,"Owned 'original' and now this newer version.  cuts/edges trenches well.  Only complaint is the front adjuster wheel delivered with adjuster knob loose and by the time I figured it out after use for about 25 minutes the mount bar hole was becoming damaged.  boo.  but great device, would buy again."
4.0,Does job efficiently and quickly.
5.0,great works well  wolud i buy it again hell yeah
5.0,This edger works well.  The availability of blades makes this machine even more appealing.  Great price too.
5.0,Use it all the time. Does a great job and is easy to use. My only complaint is that my electric cord keeps disconnecting. Not sure how to keep the plug in other than to duct tape it on. I have not done that I just keep picking the cord up and plugging it back in.
1.0,not working well
1.0,I owned one for the past 5 years and was very happy but for some reason (cost savings?) they changed the original circular handle to an awkward nob thing making it extremely difficult to control.  Will most likely return it for another brand.
5.0,"Works real well, such a cleaner and faster job than using a weed whacker."
4.0,WORKS GREAT BUT THE BLADE WEARS OUT TO FAST.
5.0,"Love my edger!  The yard looks so good when we edge the sidewalk, driveway and curb!  This is our second unit -- we used the first one for years until the motor died!  Highly recommend!  I don't do well with gas powered units (hard to start), so this item is a charm!"
5.0,I have had one of these before.  They work well.  I wore my six year old one out.
2.0,"It's big, it's heavy, and it's a nightmare to try to edge (which means going near plants) with a corded tool"
4.0,Does come ready to work. Just place the upper handle. Come with hedging blade installed.
5.0,Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this edger for normal yard maintenance.
1.0,"I don't understand how this edger has such a high rating.? I have used it for 2 years now, and it is the most frustrating piece of equipment I have ever used. It simply DOES NOT GET THE JOB DONE!!! It does not cut deep enough causing you to have to go over the same spot 2 and 3 times. I have resorted to my string trimmer. I would have better luck with a pair of scissors on my hands and knees!"
5.0,After using a heavy gas powered edger and sore shoulder and arms I realized the ease and lightness of this product.  I will learn to deal with the long electric cord vs exhausted body of heavy trimmer
3.0,"I bought this in May and in August I had to take it to be repaired as the blade wasn't turning at the same speed as the motor!  After driving 90+ miles to the repair center, the man there said that he was pretty sure he would not be able to get parts to repair it, but B&D would send me a replacement one.  Indeed they did, although it took about two weeks for it to arrive.  I hope the replacement lasts longer.  While working it did a great job of edging my long driveway.  The key is for it to keep working!"
5.0,"I was looking to replace my gas powered Troy Bilt edger that had decided to stop working. As I had a time deadline to get my lawn done, I chose this edger partly because of Amazon Prime and quick delivery. Reviews were good, but I wasn't sold on getting something electric as I was trying to get away from cords.

I placed my order on a mobile device and it arrived on 'grass cutting' day just in time for me to use it. Quick assembly and I put it right to the test. It was SO much better than the Troy Bilt (that cost 3 times as much, by the way). Easy start, easy operation and a nice clean cut.

I have used it several times since the first and still have no complaints.  I'm anxious to try edging around gardens (I typically edge walkways and driveways) to see how that works out. There is an adjustment made for that so I'm optimistic I can now do that, as I was not able with my previous edger.

For the price and the quality of cut, I'm well pleased with this Edger."
