5.0,Exactly what I needed.
2.0,"I agree with the other review, the opening is too small.  I almost bent the hook on some very expensive earrings trying to get these up higher than just the end so they're not seen.  Would not buy again but for the price, not sending back."
4.0,Love these... I am going to order another pack to keep in work; someone (including myself) is always losing the back to an earring.  I don't understand why all fish hook earrings don't have them.  Just wish that they were a tiny bit longer.  :)
2.0,too tiny an opening
3.0,Okay
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"These little plastic backs work great.  No more loosing ""hook"" earrings!  Wish I had ordered these sooner before I had lost some of my favorite earrings!"
3.0,mother - in - law wanted it as a present for her sister. she liked it and said it would work.
3.0,"Item is of good quality. Looks great, too. But it does not fit 100's! But it can be stretched to fit them if you carefully push bottom of case with your fingers. Then shove in a pack of 100's(max) and level it out as you close case stretching case closed. Leave a pk.in it for month or so & was la! Buxton is usually a good quality product!"
3.0,"I had used my last el-cheapo fake leather cigarette case for SEVEN YEARS. It still closed completely but the plastic made to look like leather was literally falling off, so it was time for a new one. Cigarette cases for kings size cigs are not easy to come by these days I discovered, but I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon. It was a great price, REAL LEATHER, and even had the cool zipper pouch on the back. I was so excited to get my case and toss that other one! Well, within THREE DAYS one of the gold clasps literally broke off! I couldn't believe it! I tried to super glue it back on and was not successful. so, I still use the case but it doesn't close securely. I was very disappointed that my $3.00 plastic one lasted 7 years and this real nice leather one lasted 3 days!! But I still love the zipper pouch on the back, it's great for the spare key to my car because I will not go ANYWHERE without my cigarettes!"
4.0,This brand has been around a long time and you can count on good quality merchandise.  Held up well with no rips or stitching problems!
2.0,I smoke 100's and these are NOT made for them.  I can get my cigarettes in it but it won't close. I was very disappointed.
1.0,"cheap and cheesy, but i guess i could have expected that for the price, won't purchase another without seeing first"
1.0,"I ordered a ladies cigarette case for my wife, and a pack of Marlboro 100's would not fit in the case!!!!  I was ripped off!!!  A cigarette case should be able to hold any cigarette pack!!!!  I will not do business with Silverhooks again!!!!

It's not even worth the postage to send it back!!!!

Dissatisfied big time!!!!"
4.0,"Received the case in less than a week...was very satisfied with the product...only one problem...not really a problem with product, but with price as inside the product was a Buxton tag that showed sugg retail at $9.99 and I paid $11.99.  Hmmm...didn't quite understand this, but what are you going to do?!  Beware...as I think that had I gone to the Buxton web site I may have been able to obtain the same product for the sugg retail price."
3.0,Love it but it tore up shortly after I got it. I ordered two and they both tore at the part that connects to the metal. Great seller though. Very prompt.
5.0,I love it it is just what I was looking for thank you!
5.0,"Quality product, I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"I like it except it is not quite big enough for the brand I smoke which is Salem Slim 100s.  They only come in the box type, I do tear the top of the box off but they still get a little smashed up at the filters."
3.0,It is smaller than what I was expecting. The zipper compartment is not big enough .
5.0,love it
1.0,Don't like it. It will not hold my cigarettes. Not long enough.
4.0,love
4.0,Wonderful item. I have purchased several of these. They last forever unless you lose them.  I am happy with my purchase Buxton is made to last.
5.0,"I just love it! I think this is my six or seven case from Buxton. They are very stylish, durable and proper if you don't want your cigarette packet crushed inside your purse"
4.0,made well but will only hold a small pack of ciggs I don't smoke I use  this as a tip holder for work I bought a different one last year but it is falling apart so I replaced it with this brand.  The zipper compartment won't hold anything its to small
5.0,"I've ordered quite a few cases from Amazon and this one is my favorite!!
Beautiful, slim and perfect for smaller handbags!"
5.0,Holds my cigarettes and it is durable and looks great.
1.0,Does not hold 120s to small for a lighter
1.0,"It fits my cigarettes, however very cheep material and smaller than the usual size of these. I would never purchase another one. It seems like a dollar store item"
1.0,Terrible quality
3.0,nice but does not fit 100s
4.0,Good quality
4.0,I like the case.  A lighter fits in the opening without a problem
5.0,"I love it , it is the first one that I have found too fit the 120's cigerette's. Thanks so much for finding this case for me."
5.0,I love it thank you
3.0,nice but to small for my 100s cigs
1.0,"Says it fits 100s, nut does not"
4.0,"The outside pocket isn't wide enough for my needs, but these are SO HARD TO FIND anymore."
5.0,Excellent product!
5.0,Excellent product and service! Thank you!
5.0,Perfect cigarette case.  These are so hard to find anymore that I was delighted with it.
3.0,"Too small, and my lighter falls out all the time"
2.0,"It's ok, It doesn't close if you have 100's"
4.0,"Nice quality, but a little small for 100's.  Would be great for shorts."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted. THANKS
5.0,"Just what I order,beru pleased."
5.0,all leather
5.0,This works so very good to keep your cig.. lighter ans anything else you may want to eep in it
5.0,Perfect size and really nice!
5.0,Awesome
5.0,"Soft leather, very well made."
5.0,great!!
5.0,Great
1.0,NOT GOOD FOR ME I THOUGHT IT WAS 100 PK
3.0,"Lining in lighter pocket tore within a very short time, had to dab a little contact adhesive between lining and leather to hold it in place and stop it bunching and snagging lighter. Purchased one black one brown, black one used most and has no centre seam down front lighter or rear coin pockets. Brown one has (pointless) decorative centre seam (as usually illustrated) front and rear. Front seam stitching has no reinforcing at lighter pocket opening. Looks likely to give trouble sooner rather than later. Leather is good and solid. Size is spot on for regular (84mm) packs of 20 (after a little use). O.k., But not the ""premium product"" I used to associate with the Buxton name many years ago."
4.0,Good product but not for 100's or 120's.
1.0,Too small
4.0,"I like this case, but I smoke 100's and it is a little tighter fit than I would like. Otherwise it seems great quality"
3.0,Nice case but not really large enough for the 100's cigarettes
5.0,"Great buy...the case is very soft and fits kings only, which is what my mom wanted... only problem is shipping, it arrived over a week later than was promised because it was sent all over the US I stead of straight to me..."
4.0,"Good, just what I expected."
4.0,Bought this for my mom as hers was really worn out. Like the added addition of the zipper pocket!
5.0,"I had been looking for a replacement for a cigarette case I'd had for over 25 years and lost. After reviewing several I settled on this one. It was very well made, the leather was soft, not stiff or cheap looking. I loved the little front pocket that kept my lighter handy and easy to keep up with. There is even a small zippered pocket for change or whatever else. I was very pleased with it. Unfortunately, I had not read the description well enough and I discovered this case DOES NOT fit the 100's. It was such a nice case that I gave it to my daughter rather than return it. She has been more than pleased with it. I'm hoping the new one I have ordered is as nice."
5.0,It's just what I wanted.
3.0,Pretty wallet but to small for the cigarettes
3.0,"I was disappointed to find the my 100's won't fit in this case. Otherwise, it was exactly what I wanted. If there is a bigger one just like this, I wish someone would point it out to me. I'd buy it in a heartbeat!"
2.0,Is very small. Doesn't  fit my smokes...
5.0,Worked great for my 100's I smoke.  Leather was supple and would definitely buy again. I wish It came in RED or PURPLE. Black is sooo hard to find in a black lined purse.
4.0,"Perfect leather cigarette case/purse, if you smoke the shorties. I gave this 4 stars because I didn't read the fine print where it said it will not accommodate Lights 100s aka the longer cigarettes."
5.0,Hard to find and still the best
4.0,a little to short but will work
4.0,"Purchased 2 cases, the quality of the leather is really good, I just wish the case was a little larger,once you put your cigarettes and lighter in the case you don't have any room
to put anything in the little side zip pocket."
2.0,doesn't fit 100's
2.0,It does not fit 100's
1.0,"This product is not a good fit as it does not hold 100s, so I have to send it back."
5.0,Love this case I have had about 10 of them over the years so glad you carry them
1.0,I ordered black got brown not happy!
5.0,Buxton has always used quality leather in all of the products they have offered over the years and they still do. The case is very well constructed and should last many years.
4.0,barely holds a pack of 100's but would be better if i smoked regulars
5.0,Very pleased with this cigarette case. I've had the exact same one before but I lost it. It holds up really well compared to some other cases I've owned. You won't be sorry if you purchase this and the price is right.
5.0,Perfect and durable. I love the look and feel of this case. I have purchased two different colors and considering a third. Love it!
4.0,Great value at price.
5.0,"Well made, nice leather too!"
3.0,"IT IS ATTRACTIVE, BUT IT'S ON THE SMALL SIDE. MY CIGARETTES DO FIT IN THERE, BUT WITH FORCING. THE LONGER THAT I USE IT, THE MORE IT STRETCHES OUT SOME. IT'S NOT AS TIGHT AS IN THE BEGINNING."
5.0,"I bought this for a relative of mine. I haven't seen it as I sent it to her in another state. But She said that she really likes it, is very happy with it. Its just what she wanted.  it is made very well."
5.0,"I cannot believe this case cost as little as it did.  I was skeptical of what the quality was going to be like after I ordered it.  When I received it I was amazed because it is real leather and it looks fabulous.  It is a little snug if you try to put a hard pack in it but all you have to do is tear off the top off the cigarettes and they fit.

GREAT BUY"
5.0,"I ordered the Buxton Heiress collection Black  Leather cigarette Case with lighter pocket, instead I received Urban Express Sandra Framed Wallet, Pewter, the  wallet is mismarked, The code bar on the wallet is for  the Buxton Cigarette case, just wrong merchandise, I am returning it in exchange for the Black Heiress collection cigarette case that I ordered, as for your merchandise I am very happy with it,"
1.0,"The material did not feel like leather at all.  Felt very cheap and plasticy and like it would rip very easily.  Returned this.
The seller however was great - very quick shipping and return processing."
1.0,"would not hold box she did not like it too small
would not tell anyone else to buy this product"
1.0,Bought this for my wife and did not read the fine print. I thought it safe to assume a women's cigarette case would hold 100's. Not the case (pardon the punn). so I had to return this and buy the correct size which of course can be found on Amazon.
4.0,"This was a gift, and the recipient loved it. It suits the purpose it was intended for when I purchased it."
5.0,this was a gift and the party was very happy with it  only if could be a little larger for larger pkg. .leather was  very soft.
3.0,Smaller than my previous case that was the same brand ect...  Quality is good as always. Just wish it had been larger.
5.0,I use the same case for my smokes. the last one lasted 6 years that's why I always buy this one! love it
1.0,"We tried these shirts in the pinpoint fabric, but after washing they are the worst wrinkled shirt I have ever tried.  I have a steam dryer and it looks like it was rolled into a ball wet and then dried, awful!  The quality is fine, but if you iron your own shirts beware.  Probably okay if you use the cleaners."
5.0,Hard to find shirts that are not non-iron (which don't hold up well to commercial laundering) anymore. These are good.
2.0,"Below average for the money.  The button holes are poorly finished and the fabric is thin enough that you'll want to wear an undershirt.  I have no doubt it'll shrink badly if washed.  There is NO wrinkle control so it arrived folded but looked like an old rag when unpackaged.  This just adds to the fact it's cheap material.  I see this as a dry clean only occasional use dress shirt.

The sad thing is their other shirts may use better material but if they don't and I paid $69 for a shirt of this quality I'd return it.  My search continues for a good quality dress shirt at a reasonable price!"
3.0,The fit was a bit awkward for my athletic body type.  Fabric quality overall is good.
5.0,Great style with quality fabric and nice fit
5.0,Good quality
1.0,Does not perform nearly as well as other cotton no iron shirts. Wrinkles badly
5.0,Great quality and comfortable to wear
5.0,Great shirt with specific sleeve length.  Not 34/35 mess.
3.0,"A bit smaller fit than some of the other brands I have bought, and a bit Short on the tail. nice shirt though"
5.0,"Good quality shirt, fit as expected."
2.0,"As other reviewers have said, this shirt fit fine out of the package, but with one washing (yes, I read the label directions), the shirt sleeve shrank significantly in length (more than 1"", leaving no cuff exposure possible on me with a jacket), and the collar shrunk enough to be uncomfortable to button. Still fine for a use as a casual shirt with some jeans, it seems well made and with a comfortable fabric, but the shrinkage makes this an unacceptable product for a dress wardrobe. That's really a shame, because the shirt feels great otherwise."
1.0,"This shirt was the right size when it arrived.  After I washed it once in cold water, it shrank excessively.  The sleeves shorten by one and a half inches.  I would not recommend this shirt or anything else from this vendor."
3.0,It's ok
3.0,"This shirt came slightly soiled apparently from the automatic folding machines.  Paul Frederick customer service was easy to deal with.  However, the shirt ran a bit small.  The supposed 35"" sleeves were barely long enough, and my husband has consistently worn a 16-1/2 x 35 shirt size for years.  Be aware that there is no wrinkle-guard protection in this all-cotton shirt.  I didn't notice that when ordering, and it was a challenge to iron the ""rumpled look"" out."
5.0,"Great fit, great deal ... classic shirt!  The Paul Fredrick line does it again!"
4.0,Great material and feel.  Somewhat snugger around the waist vs other regular fit oxfords.
2.0,Shirt is ok ok neck and sleeve but the body is too big
1.0,Shirt fit fine out of packaging. Washed according to instructions. Shirt Shrunk and could not be buttoned.
4.0,Nice shirt
2.0,Fits too big
5.0,Good quality shirt.
5.0,great for pleasure or work
5.0,Nice shirt at a great price.
5.0,Beautiful shirt. Very high quality cotton.
4.0,"Gorgeous shirt, fits as expected and looks just as sharp in person. My one complaint about the Paul Fredrick shirts is that the cuff only has one button. It fits loosely around my wrists so I had the tailor move the button for a better fit.

But for that I would have given five stars."
5.0,Great Fit!
5.0,Good fit
2.0,"Made in China. Over priced. All mine will be EAGLE. Suggest that anyone wanting a Paul Fredrick, check out Eagle Men's !"
4.0,"I've worn this shirt about every other week for a little over a year now, and it's held up very well. No fraying around the cuffs, the buttons remain secure, and the feel of the cloth remains butter-smooth. It costs a wee bit more than other lesser-quality shirts, and I think the extra expense is worth it."
5.0,"I was looking at the previous review and I think they missed the boat on this one. I don't think they understood what they purchased. This is a pinpoint 2 ply oxford. Naturally very wrinkle prone. This doesn't make the shirt a bad one. In fact in my mind it's on of the best quality shirts you can buy. You must either be very good with a iron and starch or have these pressed for $1.50. I recommend the latter but my wife does an ok job ironing these. I own about 20 Paul Frederick shirts and I like them all. You cant beat the quality especially if get them on sale like I do.

I also recommend Kirkland (Costco brand) which is the best shirt on the market other than brooks brothers,

These are much better than the other brands like, Van Hussein, Geoffrey Bean and Claiborne for sure..."
3.0,"This is a great shirt, but with any quality shirt, it requires careful laundering. However, you will find it at a better price directly on the Paul Frederick website."
1.0,"Don't buy this shirt unless you plan to spend lots of money on laundry.  For the price, I expected a shirt that would be basically wrinkle free.  I have many all cotton shirts that do not need to be ironed after every washing.  This is not one of them.  Not worth the cost."
4.0,"Nice shirt, Well made. good sizing. Nice color. Will need ironing. He wore it for our wedding reception. He looked great."
5.0,Finally a shirt that fits!  I have a thick neck :)  normal sized shirts for my frame choke me even when my wife moves the button.  These don't.  They could be softer though and usually need ironing.
5.0,Fits perfectly
2.0,Other reviewers said these shirts were hard to iron. I should have listened. Once you do get them ironed you can be guaranteed that any movement will bring those wrinkles back immediately. I wore the shirt for 2 hours and it looked like I'd slept in it for a week.
5.0,"wanted a lose fit, the sleeve cuff buttons  could be tighter"
5.0,Excelente.
5.0,This is a great shirt!  It feels like the same construction and material of others that cost 5 times as much.  I can't recommend Paul Fredrick enough if you are looking for quality apparel at reasonable prices.
5.0,I see the bad reviews so I Have to post mine. This shirt is fantastic. The complete equivilant of a $100 department store shirt. It's bright white. Fits and looks great. I do send them to the laundry after I wear it. Dont be foooled by the cheap price this shirt is perfect to wear with an expensive suit
1.0,"needs to be iron and its takes a long time to do that I won,t buy them again"
2.0,too large
2.0,The other reviewers are right.  You literally cannot get the wrinkles out of this shirt.  My dry cleaners press this thing multiple times and it still show creases.
5.0,"If you want a look that takes it back to the Old School, buy this shirt. It isn't as appreciated as it used to be, but it's just as relevant now as it was back then. Perfect with a classic black tie for job interviews. However, stay aware of the buttons leading up to the cufflinks. Sometimes they can snap off if not attended to. Other than that, a shirt of sophistication. Guaranteed."
5.0,Love the shirt.  My husband loves it so much.  He loves the neck and the material bar for the tie.  Fits great.  I recommend this product.  Your husband will love it.  Quality great.
5.0,"Beautiful shirt. Love the snap tab collar, older ones were button tab closure which could be difficult to maneuver.
Only negative is the collar which is my size but seemed a size larger."
5.0,Great shirt. Really looks nice with my suit
3.0,"Fit was spot on. Only bad thing about it is that it wrinkles easily. I misread and though it was a ""no iron"" shirt, though I am very happy with its look and it feels like decent quality. Also wish it wasn't made in China!"
5.0,great shirt
5.0,quality at a good price
5.0,I have nothing but good to say about the Paul Fredrick tab collar French cuff dress shirt.  Shirt fits perfectly and looks very very nice!
5.0,"Great quality- only type of shirts I want from now on, love that it snaps behind the tie and keeps my tie in place as well!"
5.0,quite happy
4.0,"Good fit, good quality.  But the 100% cotton wrinkles easily."
5.0,Very nice shirt.
4.0,Very nice shirt.  Fits as expected.  The material is nice; light weight but not flimsy or see-through.  I wish it came in a few other basic colors.
5.0,"It's a great shirt, and fits me perfectly.  I think it's a great buy for the price.  The logistics of ordering and delivery were exactly as promised."
1.0,"Pres of co..wear dress shirts and ties every day.
Shirt fit great...but wrinkled fast than any shirt Ive ever seen.  Will keep for only special occasions"
5.0,I expected it to fit comfortably & it did
5.0,Great shirt. It popped as expected and helped me stand out amongst the crowd.
5.0,Nice shirt. Just as I expected. 5 stars.
4.0,"This is a great looking, comfortable shirt, I will have to learn to tie smaller knots. The instructions are on the back of their neckties package for various styles has helped."
4.0,I say not a bad buy for not having to go into a store and try them on. THink I may buy another
5.0,"Shopping through Amazon provides a large number of products to choose from and sizes difficult to find in stores. The shirt I ordered is quality and I am very pleased plus it saved me considerable time from not having to search stacks of shirts to find 171/2, 32inch sleeve."
5.0,Great shirt.
4.0,I liked the shirts! They fit as expected however they will require a little more maintenance in that they are not wrinkle free.
5.0,excellent
5.0,great
3.0,"cuff's are a little tight, tab collar doesn't fit tie very well it leaves openings on the side after trying different knot sizes"
5.0,"I was looking for a tab collar dress shirt.  I have always liked that style, but lately I had been unable to find any. I looked on Amazon and lo and behold; there they were. Reasonable price, fast delivery and excellent quality. I have absolutely no complaints and I intend to purchase several more in the near future."
5.0,"First piece of clothing I ever ordered on-line.  Quick delivery, great fit. A quality product. I'll be  sure to order again."
4.0,"Is as listed, good quality shirt."
5.0,Beautiful
5.0,I'm going to get rid of all of my other dress shirts! These are the best.
5.0,I will order another one.
4.0,Looks Good
5.0,"Love the shirt, fits and feels great!!!"
4.0,"I like the shirt so far...have been looking for some time for a good tab collar white shirt.  I wish it was offered in a cotton/poly blend rather in just 100% cotton.  That would be far easier to care for and keep pressed.  The fit is right for me, classic cut and the size that normally fits me.  I will probably buy another...that is unless I find another that is cotton/poly blend."
5.0,excellent quality at a value price fit is exact.
5.0,Love shirt and even makes me look good!
5.0,great shirt
2.0,"It was too small for my head in that the neck part didn't even come to the bottom of my neck. Plus it's see-through. My face and hair were visible through it.

The only good thing is that it's breathable. Not what i was looking for though."
4.0,"While clearly an excellent mask for the novice and professional ninja, I purchased it primarily for winter sports.  It is extremely comfortable while skiing and snowboarding, and the touch of silk while sitting upon the lifts seems to provide a calm soothing feeling to offset the pain from my numerous falls on the moguls.  It keeps you cool from your own body heat but simultaneously keeps your face warm despite the freezing temperatures around you.  It is very breathable, but my only issue was that it did trap the moisture of my breath."
4.0,This China Silk Black Balaclava is great for keeping you warm. I love it!
5.0,"This item is very lightweight (as you'd expect from silk underwear).  While we were using it under a costume, rather than for winter warmth, the several people using it all said it was very comfortable and not too hot inside the costume."
3.0,"The seller was courteous and prompt, and when I suggested that the shipping cost was too high, they graciously lowered it. However, the balaclavas I received were not silk. The tag on the inside clearly stated that they were 100% cotton. Perhaps I was shipped the wrong item, but sellers shouldn't misrepresent products like that. If I'd complained to the seller, I feel confident that they would have refunded my money, but these were for halloween costumes (which turned out just fine), so I didn't have time to deal with returns and such."
3.0,The product was new when it arrived and after 3 hunting trips it came home in pieces. The price was good but the quality was not!
4.0,"This product was exactly as described. I've used it for running, both as a base layer and also the only layer.  It has helped keep my face warm from the biting MN wind.  With more severe windchills I've put a fleece  balaclava over it and it formed a great base layer."
2.0,"I am very disappointed with this item.  First, in moderately cold skiing weather 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, my face was a little cold through this mask.  While skiing downhill, the wind shred through this mask.  Second, after only 1 weekend of moderate use, the front of the mask was worn away.  I would not be surprised if it tore during the 2nd weekend of use.  Third, I have a medium sized head and this thing was wayyyy too big for me.  Finally, the mask traps the moisture of my breath and freezes it, making the mask uncomfortable around the mouth area.

The only pros are that it is lightweight and breathable."
5.0,"This lightweight balaclava is perfect for winter, summer, spring or fall.  Helps keep you warm in the winter yet light enough to wear on a hot summer day.  It is easy to put on and take off and so cheap that you throw it away after each job.  Slip it on before you are in view of any CCTVs and simply dump it after you are far enough away it won't be connected to the scene.  It prevents sweat and hairs from being left at the scene so the police are unlikely to get a DNA print, and makes it impossible for anyone to ID you. The perfect accessory for the professional thief.  I've used it on over 20 thefts and haven't got caught yet.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Silk-Black-Balaclava/dp/B0000AWHAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Silk Black Balaclava</a>"
5.0,my son has to wait on a main road to catch the school bus and he does not get cold from cars driving by and creating wind. Love it
4.0,"This balaclava is thin enough to see through.  However, it still seems to contain a good amount of heat and is thin enough to wear year round.  Overall a good buy for the money."
5.0,Excllent value. Very light weight and perfect for under a stocking cap with a pair of earmuffs.  Quick shipper.
4.0,"Received it quickly and in great condition, along with a catalog and coupons for the next purchase."
3.0,"This is a vry durable, soft and nice feeling skimask, but, there is always a but, its to short, it won't cover ur neck, or at least not mine, and im not that big, i am only 6'0'' so thats my only complain, aside from that, its a very good skimask.
Dr. Tomas Muoz"
5.0,"This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width!  Very impressed."
5.0,"This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased."
5.0,"It was exactly as described.  Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish.  I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store"
4.0,"This is a nice ring.  It is simple and elegant.  The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched.  I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out.  It would be great for a college student's budget."
5.0,it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it.
5.0,"When I first saw this offer last year, I couldn't believe it was genuine. I was used to paying $10 to $15 a pair for wool socks. When they arrived, I still found it hard to believe. But these are excellent quality socks that have held up well through heavy use and lots of washings. The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'!"
5.0,"Socks seem like a strange kind of thing on which to write a review, but these socks are special. I placed an order for a friend of mine who runs a soup kitchen in Poplar Bluff Missouri. It was an order of about 60 pairs of these socks which probably seemed pretty strange to the people at Sportsman's Guide, but they sent them anyway. I didn't think much about it until I got an e-mail from Joni, the lady in Poplar Bluff, that the socks had arrived.
She told me that you would think that the socks were made of gold the way the people at her free store responded to them. They had NEVER seen such socks!! They were soft and they were thick and warm. Most of them had never even heard of wool socks.
Now I don't think twice about wool socks because I love them but it gave me real pause to think that there were people who had never even heard of such a wonderful thing. These people couldn't believe that someone would just give them something this good. Yes, this good.
So if you're thinking of buying some of these why don't you get an extra pair or two and give them to someone who needs them. It will be an education, I promise, and your gift will reward you many times over when you experience the gratitude such a small thing can evoke."
5.0,"I ordered these socks for my Mother's birthday and she absolutely loves them. They are thick and warm, perfect for cold Indiana winters.  Thank you."
3.0,"I like the thicknesss of the socks and because of this, I know they'll be warm enough for anything that the snow has to offer. I would really like these socks if they came in a variety of colors; grey is not a very exciting color, however; as long as you're warm, who cares about excitement."
5.0,"My first review but I have to say......About 15 years ago I developed an allergy to nickle (earrings, necklaces, belt buckles, buttons, bracelets!) and stopped wearing most jewelry. I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24/7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU."
5.0,"It is refreshing to wear these earrings because they don't make my earlobes swell up. My ears are too sensitive for ""sensitive"" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It's like my ears don't even know they're there :) ."
5.0,"I just had my ears pierced a little over two months ago and I thought the minor discomfort was part of the healing process.  I decided to try these but honestly didn't expect there to be a difference.  Within hours of wearing these my ears had no discomfort at all.  Again, my ears weren't red or swollen but just had a very minor ache.  I'd recommend these to people even if it's not the last resort to wearing earrings.

I also really like the small simple style so these were perfect for me anyway.  I've found it very difficult to find earrings I like in stores because they all seem so big and overbearing.  I'm sure that I will end up buying more pairs of these in a similar style and definitely give preference to titanium earrings."
5.0,"I just got these a few weeks ago (along with a pair of titanium hoops) and love them. I haven't been able to wear earrings for years because of nickel allergies, and these earrings haven't given me any trouble whatsoever!"
5.0,these are the only earrings that have not caused an allergic reaction and they are very pretty too.
5.0,"I have only owned these earrings a few weeks, but I'm quite pleased with them.  Before buying these, I had been completely unable to wear earrings for many years.  My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even ""hypoallergenic"" earrings.  I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.

When these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.

I noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.

I highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I'm planning to get another pair."
2.0,The Suspenders are fine except one of the tongues or the buckles was put it the wrong way and the fastening of this one is not as secure as the correct buckle and the tongue sticks awkwardly out. I will have to take it to a leather shop to have the problem fixed. Other than that product is fine.
5.0,"These leather suspenders I highly recomend. They are simple, and compfortable. Easy to adjust. Look great!"
5.0,"I have worn suspenders for quite a few years.  It is nice to buy a pair that really feels solid and comfortable.  From the construction to the materials used, I am impressed.  They look good in casual dress or on my jeans and really stand up to a hard days work."
5.0,I got these for my boyfriend and they have worked out really well--nice quality materials and good performance.
4.0,Actually I didn't buy them as liner gloves. I was looking for a light weight glove with some flexibility and durability. These fit the bill. They are perfect for dog walking in moderate winter weather. Fingers are a little short but they still work.
2.0,"I think this is a case of getting what you pay for.  Although they look ok and are pretty warm, the pair I got for my husband has some definite problems.  The two gloves (sized L/XL) are two different sizes.  One glove fits fine, but the other is much smaller (the fingers don't fit all the way on one side).  Because of this bad fit, he wore them for the first time this morning and the smaller glove is already ripping.  No good."
4.0,"1.13.12 UPDATE: I've now been using these gloves through all of December and half of January and I continue to recommend them. Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job. If I remember, I'll post an update once the weather gets even colder.

My only concern is the fit. I'm an average size guy, and there's something a little uncomfortable about the way they fit, as if the fingers could've been cut lower, that makes me think I'd have an issue with them if I were a taller guy with bigger hands. That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them."
5.0,Had a pair of these for the past few years. same thing... great gloves for running and even short (1-2 hour long) bike rides in the cold.
3.0,"These gloves are good for running, but won't keep your hands warm if it's too windy. My only concern is about their durability. I've used them last winter for running (in Fayetteville, AR) and while traveling in Montana (Glacier and Yellowstone) during the end of Spring. The knits are starting to get loose, and I don't know how much longer they'll endure."
5.0,I ordered these for my husband who trains as a triathlete. He loves wearing them in the cooler months to keep his hands warm while he's running or biking.
5.0,"Awesome gloves.  They're thin enough that you almost forget you have them on, but they're thick enough to keep my hands warm.  I'm in California so the coldest weather I have to run in is probably about 50 degrees.  Hard to beat at this price"
5.0,"Good product, good transaction"
5.0,These are really pretty. I love Silver Forest earrings. Wish I could find merchants who honor their earring club. No one seems to carry the card/stickers needed to receive a free pair.
5.0,I would buy jewerly from this buyer again. The earrings where nice and shipped right away!
5.0,These are just gorgeous.  I received several compliments on them when i wore them to work.  seller was prompt.  very satisfied with service.
3.0,"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly ""pretty"" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad."
5.0,Nice fun earrings good color. Not heavy or cheap looking. Certainly not what you would want for a formal but great easy wearing earrings.
1.0,"This product has a different pitcher then what you actually get.. don't get it.. the back is not Turquoise, its just a pic of plastic."
2.0,"Before I purchased these earrings, others had commented on their poor quality.  These are cute but not really a very high quality."
5.0,Package arrived promptly and in good shape. Loved these beautiful earrings. I ordered them for a gift but almost kept them for myself. May have to order another pair for myself.
5.0,Purchased with a necklace on amazon and these match perfectly.  The size is just right and they are so unique that I get compliments on them.
1.0,"I was very disappointed when I received these earrings I ordered from Amazon. They are very small and the ""turquoise"" background is actually plastic with a small piece of turquoise mounted to the metal (not silver). When I purchased these, they were advertised as sale priced from $40 to $18.  Now they're advertised at $13.50. These are not the quality I expected, and I won't be ordering jewelry again."
5.0,"received ear rings and very very happy with the quality, color and style.  Will purchase another pair for my daughter. The only down side, is it needs some kind of backing. these come off my ears without me knowing it and I don't want to lose them. Otherwise, they are great!!!!!"
5.0,Bought for a gift and they look so good want to keep for myself!  I am impressed with these earrings.
2.0,"Watch out with these.  I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart.  The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off.  They are useless now.  Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive.  The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.

These are cheap and fall apart quickly."
5.0,"These are the most comfortable things I have ever worn on my feet; I bought them for gymnastics and I'm so happy that I did; They are so comfortable! But just in case you didn't know: the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper; So you have to sew them into the front- I'm assuming for proper fit; This is a bit annoying- coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front(no good if your terrible at sewing like me); And they soil easily;This should be expected of course(especially if they are white). Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially when walking on carpet; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose."
5.0,Hope they keep making these! Great fit - very comfortable. Wear quite well.  Half the price of Birks.
5.0,So far I am very pleased with these less expensive versions of Birkenstocks. Haven't noticed any lack in quality and of course love the comfort of these shoes. Birkenstocks (and Betula's) are the best!
5.0,"The nice thing with Birkenstock brand is that sizes are incredibly consistent across the various divisions (Birkenstock, Birkis, Papillio, Betula, etc.); so when your favorite relative laments that they can't find ""tan"" suede 2-strap birkenstocks to replace their old ones in their neck of the woods, it's a sure bet you'll get the size, quality, and color you ask for when you order them sight unseen.  There are lots of imitations out there, but only Birkenstock products hold up the way you need them to.  A bit more to pay for the guarantee of durability and craftsmanship that will make these sandals last SOOOO much longer than the ""knock-offs"", but well worth the comfort and peace of mind."
5.0,I had a pair of these stolen while returning from a cruise. I am so happy to have a new pair. They are my favorite shoes.
5.0,"I have been looking for this particular style of Birkenstock for over two years.  I already own a pair just like this and, unfortunately, they got wet so they don't look new anymore.  I was so happy to find them.  They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  I have flat feet and most shoes aren't very easy to wear for a very long period of time.  I can wear these all day and not only do my feet not hurt but my back doesn't either.  This was a great find!!"
5.0,I love my sandals. They are the second pair I've bought. The first pair were clogs and I love them too. I wear my sandals all the time. I would reccomend them to anyone for themselves or as presents for others.
5.0,ups delivery left something to be desired..but thats ups for you..*sighs*- but hey the shoes were great shipping time was great kudos to the person I purchased from frowns to ups -anita
5.0,"This is an item I had looked for locally first... but couldn't find at a reasonable price.

However, I did find it on Amazon.com....the first search...and the price was great.

The item as a gift and the receiver of the gift was very pleased.

Thank you for outstanding service...not to mention an outstanding product.

Sincerely,

Michael Collins"
4.0,"Wearing the same style Betulas purchased years ago (and they're still going strong!), I was so sure of my size that I ordered 3 new pairs in assorted colors. Well, no such luck. The footbeds of the ""new"" size 38's are slightly smaller than on my old sandals. My toes were hitting the edge of the footbed. Not comfortable at all. (I'm a size 7 in regular shoes).

So, I had to return them at my expense, and then pay the shipping to get the larger sized relacements sent to me. Now the fronts fit fine, but on the whole, the new size is a bit too large for the rest of my feet!

So, go to the mall and try them on first before buying, for best results."
2.0,"I do believe that this product is a type of Birkenstock, or maybe they have a license to sell as a Birkenstock, but they are not the Original Birkenstock as they claim to be.

I did not appreciate the service I received from Midwest Sports. Choosing the size by the sizing chart and comparing it to my shoe size, I thought I chose the correct size; but it was not, it was a size larger. So I had to exchange them. Not only did I have to pay for the postage to return the item, I was also charged to have the correct size mailed back to me. In my past experiences, the dealer has always been the one to pay for the postage.

Will I purchase from Midwest Sports again? No."
4.0,"Betula is similar to Birkenstock, not the same and much less expensive. The cork sole looks and feels different and the arch is not as prominent as in Birkenstock. Overall they are a nice alternative."
5.0,Shoes were just what I wanted and the price was exceptional.  Service was great - got my order in just a couple of days
5.0,"I have all hardwood floors in my house and wanted/needed a good pair of shoes to wear in the house that would support my feet.
These are great. They arrived timely and are exactly what I needed. Plus they are very reasonably priced for having the comfort and benefits of Birkenstocks, but without the Birkenstock price."
1.0,the fake fabric top is too flimsy to stay up. Extremly hard to put on.
5.0,These shoes are very comfortable and look just like Birkenstock.  They feel like them also.
5.0,Have worn this style sandal for years. Still haven't worn out my first pair. In the hot CA desert summers they are perfect.
5.0,I wanted this kind of sandal.  I found them.  I ordered them.  They came to my house undamaged and in a timely manner.  All is well.
2.0,"I don't understand what people see in these sandals. I ordered a pair and they were so big I couldn't keep them on. However, I kept them, and recently I have gained some weight - even in my feet. Also, I broke my toe a few days ago, so I thought I would try these sandals again. Well, they did feel good for the toe, but my right foot made such a sucking noise when I walked that I changed to another shoe. I didn't want everyone in the store looking at me because of the sucking noise. I just don't get it."
4.0,Comfortable once worn in. I had my last pair for 4 years so they fit me perfectly so it was kinda dissapointing to go through the process again
5.0,"I love sandals, I wish that was all that I could wear.  What's not to love about Birks=)"
4.0,"very nice shirt.  Just really billowy.  I had to bring i to a tailor to get it fitted.  Measurements are all accurate, just know it's not going to be a tight fit."
5.0,great looking shirt - fits very well - will order other colors
4.0,Really nice shirt for the price
5.0,I've been buying these shirts for years. Excellent quality and fit.
5.0,Great buy
5.0,"Excellent shirt
 Made to exacting detail. Fits perfectly"
5.0,He loved it!
4.0,I ordered it monogrammed but it did not come with it on the shirt. Other than that great shirt.
5.0,I nave several Paul fredrick shirts and I love them!
5.0,excellent
3.0,had better expectation!((
5.0,I am pleased with my selection.
5.0,A very handsome dress shirt that I enjoy wearing often.
5.0,"Finally, a good quality shirt that fits as it should fit."
5.0,"Perfect fit, great fabric."
5.0,Super fast delivery. Thank you. I will be wearing these boots with a 70's style dress. They are beautiful and I cant wait to wear them. I have aways had big calves and they fit perfect. They seem well made with nice material. I love these boots!
5.0,"I have skinny calves, so the previous reviews stating they were too small in the calves helped motivate me to make this purchase! These boots are awesome! I get complements every day. I did insert arch supports, which I do with most boots I buy. The price couldn't be better."
5.0,"Just came across this boot, and i'm surprised at not only how good they look, but the prices for them were quite reasonable as well as affordable.  Not to mention, they'd look great with any Goth outfit or worn with regular slacks/jeans.  I'd highly recommend these boots for both Goth girls and guys alike."
5.0,I really loved the boots. The quality is very good. And it is very comfortable.
3.0,"The toe is not flat/level. It angles up at the tip which makes dancing not as easy or graceful aa I was looking/hoping for. The platform sandal version of this boot by the same company has a flat/level toe - PERFECT for dancing and walking. I hoped this boot would be the same, but it's not. :( Making them work, but disappointed."
5.0,I LOVE these boots. This is my second pair. My last pair lasted me seven years. So excited to have them again.
3.0,There are not stretchy enough for my thick thighs as a gay male who performs In drag it didn't fit my thighs as I wanted too but it did fit my feet so I gave it up 3.
5.0,"Easier to walk in then expected, fits perfectly except for the top is a bit tight around calf."
5.0,"I *love* these boots and am now on my 3rd pair. They fit my rather thin calves perfectly (most boots are too wide), but are a bit stretchy to fit larger calves too. The heel and platforms heights are perfect. They are a little tight around the toes when I first put them on, but after wearing them around for a while I don't notice it much. I love wearing these with jeans and tank tops or a cute short dress."
5.0,order one size larger there amazing and great for clubbing
3.0,Kinda ivory white..Not purest white I expected. Nice shape boot. Small in calf area l could have done  size larger but I squeeze into them.
3.0,"I am a size 12 mens... so according to all the reading I have done, I'm supposed to order women's boots 2 sizes larger.  When I ordered these, I got a 15... and I probably could wear a 16.  So...  these things run pretty small.  They will be used for a costume getup (no, it's not a drag outfit!).

Another thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the ""plane"" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight ""V"" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.

The 'patent leather' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it's a $50 boot, not a $500 one.  In a way this is good because it stretches to stay tight around my huge calves.

I can tell it's going to take a while to get used to walking in them, but I'll get comfortable with them in time.

EDIT:  I ordered a 16 and it fits better.  So... 4 sizes larger than my men's size rating."
5.0,Very sexy and excellent fit.  This is my second pair because I wore out the first ones !  A must buy !
3.0,"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14""), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves."
5.0,awesome
5.0,thanks
1.0,"Not happy at all this ring looked very good in the pictures, however when I received it was I so disapointed."
3.0,I gave it a 3 rating because I've had the ring for a few months now and now the stone looks worn out.  I absolutely LOVED this ring at first but now it's egh... alright.
4.0,Gem i shinny. It is real silver. I am allergic to anything other then silver. The Gem is a little over sized for the band but overall it is very pretty. I ordered it and it actually arrived earlier then the date they estimated.
4.0,"The only con to this ring is that the prongs were a little miss aligned. And other were some small scratches next to mounting.
Pros - .925 and it seems like a good sturdy ring, and the CZ is clear and exceeded expectations"
5.0,"Exactly what I was hoping for. The Cubic Zirconia is sparkly and the perfect size. Fits accurately and the color is perfect Sterling Silver. The only thing that made me a bit sad was the band, which got marked up a little somehow, either in warehouse or during transit, but luckily it's not enough to make me fuss, plus for the price, if need be I could replace it at some point rather than return it for shipping costs that are pricier."
5.0,"I love this ring. My wedding band is gold but I wear a lot of silver jewelry and wanted something to match without spending a fortune. This is perfect. It matches my wedding ring and is absolutely beautiful. Super product, super price and super fast shipping. I couldn't be any happier."
1.0,The ring looked foggy and not clear.  I wore it for two day's and took it off.  I'll probably replace the stone with a better one because the setting was sterling silver.
4.0,The ring is very nice but shipping took longer than expected.
4.0,"I have used he EXACT same brand and size for several years, RECENTLY the tag showed made in Haiti, medium in Haiti there DOES NOT equal medium EGYPT.  Amazon customer service was vey understanding arranged for a prompt exchange.  It would have been better to know PRIOR to purchase what is the country the product was made in.

Quality of construction in BOTH Haiti & Egypt very good

Fabric is very thin and comfortable, which is EXACTLY why I buy this brand.

5 Stars if the country / size did not require an exchange"
4.0,"I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's via Amazon in May'09.  I purchased men's size ""Medium"" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size ""Large"" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10"", 195lbs and usually wear a size ""Large"" in most men's tops.

In terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).

I do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.

Style-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.

Overall: 4 out of 5 stars. High marks for looks and comfort for my intended usage, minus 1 star for the slightly strange sizing causing inventory buildup in my dresser drawers.

I hope you found my review helpful."

3.0,The logo is printed on the shirt now. One arrived with a tiny hole in it.
5.0,I got it in time and these fit prefect
3.0,These were very lightweight and flimsy. Ok as an undergarment I guess but not for being seen in.
5.0,Looks new after being washed several times. Maintains shape size and color.
4.0,Seems ok.
1.0,I have purchased these shirts in years past and was very happy with them they must've changed the production style and quality because these are awful and not worth the price.  I already am seeing small tears in the shirt and they have yellow very quickly even though I use Oxsee clean and clean them regularly
1.0,"The product description says it's a lycra blend, it's not.  It's 100% cotton.  I'm 6' 190 lbs and bought the XL, it was a bit too big for an undershirt."

5.0,Would buy fro again.
4.0,Comfortable
1.0,"Even though these might be ""Calvin Klein,"" they are knock-offs of the same ones you would find in the department store. The Amazon ones are made in Bangladesh and are of cheap quality. The higher-quality versions are from Haiti. You can even tell the difference by the info printing on the shirt. A lot of the positive reviews are because of the original shirts, which are amazing. But these, are not the same.

These Bangladesh knock-offs already started falling apart after the second time wearing. Seam came loose (see picture).

C'mon Calvin Klein, sell the real ones or don't bother."
4.0,Good quality shirts the sizing wasn't right. That happens a lot with different manufacturers. Over all great I just sent them back. Reccoment ordering one size smaller than you'd normally wear if you are fit and like shirts that look good on you and not baggy.
3.0,"Not as generously cut as the last time I bought them.  And one or two are not made well and the bottom cuff is twisted, doesn't lie flat.  Annoying!"
5.0,It looks really good on my husband!
4.0,good! no problems....
5.0,Very soft and great fit
5.0,very good
5.0,Fits great....only t-shirts I wear
1.0,"these have been going downhill for a bit now.. thinner and thinner, the V width has shrunk alot too, not it is a very thin V, used to be thicker not a biggie at all, but what was, is now, with this batch anyhow (and i had ordered these just 3 months ago) now has CALVIN KLEIN printed in black on the outside of the shirt. returned"
5.0,"Texture is great, but its length. is somewhat shorter than previous in store purchases. I still give it 5 stars because it is a great product."
5.0,best t shirts ever
5.0,Good undershirts
5.0,Calvin Klein t-shirts are the most comfortable I've ever worn and shopping for underwear is no fun. I used to get this at Costco until Costco discontinued CK and only has their Kirkland brand for this product. I am very happy to replenish my t-shirt supply through Amazon.
1.0,"Not a real Calvin Klein t shirt.  I bought Calvin Klein t shirts at Nordstrom, great quality.  I figured I would by via Amazon to save time and money.  Made differently, after washing the material shows its poor quality.  Your basically paying high prices for Haynes level t shirts. AVOID. Just went back to Nordstrom to pick up a few more."
1.0,"I think I got a knockoff.  I have three CK v's already that I got at Costco that fit better and are way softer.  On the shirts from here, it says Calvin Klein on the bottom left, on the front of the shirt.  That is not displayed in the picture and I feel like a dick if I don't wear anything over it.  All in all, I feel ripped off."
5.0,Love these undershirts.
5.0,"Great fabric, well sewn, will but again"
5.0,This is The one.
5.0,Very comfortable shirts
4.0,These shirts fit perfectly and feel great.
5.0,"Very soft, comfortable shirts."
5.0,Good V-Neck shirts
3.0,Ive ordered this 3 times and each time got a slightly different product. Sometimes thinner material sometimes thicher recently shirts came with white ck logo on bottom which was nice tough but I expect consistency
4.0,Fits as expected. Not like the big shoes or small sweatpants that I had ordered
5.0,Good quality daily tees.
5.0,I only buy these undershirts - they shrink much less than your basic Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. Well worth the extra money to have a shirt that lasts.
4.0,"a little bigger than i had hoped but overall fit pretty good, look great, v neck is a little deep"
5.0,I bought these due to having one already that I really liked. I ordered the 3 pack and usually wear them to bed.  My wife thinks I look good in them so I gladly will accommodate.  These are tagless and much thicker and than some Haynes brand ones that I have since tossed.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,These shirts work well for daily wear or as undershirts. After many washes they still hold up well.
5.0,"Fit as expected - fairly standard modern american fit.
These are great looking and comfortable.  I bought 3 of these 3 packs and is the only top I wear to work . . . which makes things easy for me.
Good price

One downside is the calvin klein lettering on the bottom peels off after a wash or two.  The letters were not very noticeable anyway, so it does not really matter."
5.0,They are a bit pricey but hold shape better than cheaper shirts of the same type...deeper v and collar that holds shape better. Great for work undershirts and last longer than most cheaper undershirt brands
1.0,One wash and they cheaper than hains her wear
1.0,"The picture is not what the shirts actually look like. There is a big ""Calvin Klein"" logo on the bottom left of the shirt. I would NOT have purchased these if I knew this as I just wanted a plain black shirt. 1 star for false advertising."
5.0,Fantastic fabric weight.  Second purchase for husband.  Much better quality than that fruit company or panti hose brand...
5.0,These are very comfortable and the only t-shirts I buy. Fit is true and shrinkage is minimal when washed.
5.0,Good
5.0,all good
5.0,Always a great buy even though it is a little pricey. Feels great....no tags and long lasting quality!
2.0,It is a black shirt but it is more of an XL than M
5.0,Great shirt. Comfortable. Relaxed fit. Not too deep a V-neck.
5.0,Comfy for women too!
4.0,The V is quite deep but definitely not a deal breaker . . . Shirt texture A+ really soft cotton . . . long enough to stay tucked into the pants . . . A bit pricey but solid product.
5.0,What can I say...  They are great T-shirts.
4.0,excellent quality
2.0,"I always order my under shirts online and I usually get the Tommy brand, but this time I wanted to try a different brand. Bad Idea! I'm 5'10"", 170 lbs and I alway wear Medium size shirts and T-Shirts so I ordered the Medium size this time as well, but when they arrived they were SO BIG. I wouldn't care if they were still a little big and wearable but they look like they could be XXL. Ive contacted Amazon to return the item but now I have to pay for the shipment, very disappointing.
The item itself has a very good quality, but it's a bit more thicker than usual for an undershirt."
5.0,Excellent fit. Very comfortable. Would buy again.
5.0,Great product.
5.0,Great product shipped as promised and very fast delivery
4.0,GOOD!
3.0,The T-Shirts is nice very nice but the size was a little bit larger than I expected
5.0,Great quality undershirt.
4.0,"Good quality cotton, fit as expected."
3.0,Lasts long and stays dark for many washes.
4.0,"A little big, but make no difference."
5.0,Excellent product even if it's made in Bangladesh.
5.0,It's fit
5.0,Best tee's you can buy.
5.0,as expected
5.0,Shipped fast great shirts. Fits well
3.0,I order S but the white is  M !
5.0,I love these shirts. They fit well and are a standard in my wardrobe with an over shirt.
3.0,"One of the shirts in my pack was a size large, instead of medium."
5.0,A++++
5.0,Great shirts. They feel good and the cut is nice.
5.0,"Nice prodcut, just what I expected."
4.0,Little bit bigger
5.0,great shirt

5.0,Perfect Fit
4.0,Good order
4.0,"It's so good , I like it."
5.0,Very nice trim look
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"I took a chance on these and they are great.  I usually buy 2X but went with XL and they fit perfectly.  I like a V neck T shirt.  They are light in weight which is good for a hot and humid North Carolina summer, three different colors.  Will probably use for about three years until I get oil, grease of paint on them, but for about $11 average per shirt it was a nice way to buy and not get in traffic and heat as a result."
1.0,"Do not fit. These are not the standard CK tees as advertised. I have over 30 that fit properly, and these are cheap knockoffs."
5.0,Nice fit
4.0,Everithing ok!
5.0,These are great to protect my husband's dress shirts!
5.0,Just what my husband needed.
5.0,Love these!!!!!
5.0,Grrrrrreat!
4.0,Exelent.fit
5.0,"Looks good, feels good."
5.0,Great
3.0,"Quality good, but i should have bought a medium. Strange I bought a long sleeve large CK in the same purchase and and it fits perfect."
5.0,"Superb quality. Calvin Klein is top quality; just a little pricey, but worth it in my opinion."
5.0,I've worn these t-shirts to death! Love them.
4.0,so so
5.0,Exactly what I ordered; comfortable fit.
4.0,"I recently started buying undergarments on Amazon prime, it had never occurred to me to do so prior. Since I already know my size for this Calvin Klein t-shirt pack, it was a no brainer"
5.0,good
5.0,Good quality tees and good fit.
5.0,Perfect and feel good enough.
4.0,"Rationale behind my rating: 4 stars for material, cut, shirt length, and sleeve length. 0 stars for the V being too low cut. Background Information: I'm 5'8"" at a buck-55 in weight, with a regular build. I might buy this again, but I'm not sure."
1.0,Bad Shirts. Immediately changes shape after 1 wash.
5.0,Great feel.  Great fit.
5.0,worth the money. the cotton breathes. too bad the Calvin Klein brand is not always consistent.
4.0,The gray one is shorter than other two and they are all printed with M.I doubt the factory made a wrong one in this M package.
1.0,I ordered 2 same brand same shirt same size different colors (white and black)! Black fits perfect white is way too big.. How do i understand that?
5.0,A
2.0,"Before being washed they were on the large side, after going through the dryer (on medium/permanent press) they were too small and a little misshapen. I would not buy these again or would air dry them if necessary."
5.0,"So good. I got pack for myself (I'm a small, girl) and my BF- he's medium. Looks sexy as fff"
5.0,feel good
4.0,"High quality, cost-effective."
3.0,The T-shirts all were different lengths up to 4 inches longer then the closest other T-shirt. Pretty disappointed in the quality and attention to detail.
5.0,nice T
4.0,great price. quick delivery!
5.0,perfect
1.0,The mediums fit more like XL. Way to baggy. Who the hell picks these sizes??
5.0,very hi quality
4.0,Good teeshirts - nice fabric.
5.0,very good and fit as expected.
5.0,"Great material, very soft & very comfortable!
I will definitively buy them again!"
4.0,Fits fine!
1.0,the white T was broken when I weard it for only one day!
5.0,Fits perfectly and feels comfortable. Definitely a good buy.
2.0,"It is too larg , i donated to my friend ."
5.0,"Fit great and looks great...bought 3 pks, so yeah I like them."
5.0,"Excellent, fit as expected"
5.0,The best T-shirts you can buy. Expensive but worth it.
1.0,TOO BIG
5.0,"My boyfriend absolutely loves these shirts, great price from Amazon!!"
4.0,"The V is a little deeper than the average V neck. I like the style of the shirt, it was slightly bigger than expected. Other than that, they are comfortable and great for the gym."
5.0,very well
5.0,ok
4.0,Just right
5.0,Excellent Product and Service.
4.0,"Very happy with the purchase. I read the reviews and there was one common suggestion: order a size smaller. I'm 6ft and 170lbs. I wear medium and occasionally a large, but for this I ordered a small. I like my undershirts to be just a bit snug, and the small was perfect for me."
4.0,very good!!
5.0,good
5.0,Good price and fast shipping
1.0,"the one and only problem with this shirt is the heat transfer they used for the ""tagless label""...after laundering and drying, the logo and info bled through on the back, and now the shirts have blurry, white reversed writing on the back neck.

I planned to wear these alone, but now I'll have to use them as undershirts...

Oddly, the crew neck shirts of theirs I bought and put in the same load did not get effected at all."
5.0,Excellent
5.0,  great look & fit; the V-Neck cures the blasted stretched-out collar we hate on round-nech T-Shrirts 
5.0,Great quality t-shirt.  Long enough to stay tucked in and thicker cotton than the cheaper competitors.
5.0,"Good-looking, sturdy, long-lived shirts. Well worth the price versus cheaper brands."
3.0,"Originally wanted to order that 3 pack that included black, white, and heathered gray, but was  out of stock. now it was around the holidays at the time when I ordered these so that was to be expected, but when I received the package although the order clearly stated medium , there were t shirt sized large instead ib the packaging. If these didn't already run large it wouldnt have been an issue at all, but I had already ordered a pack of these in black so I was already aware of the potential of mis sizing..... and when you're paying 10 bucks for an undershirt it should at least fit."
5.0,Nice fit. Did not shrink much when washed. Nice quality.
3.0,"I am a 6"" tall 180 lbs man, and I figured large (L) would be fine, based on other reviews saying to err on the larger size. Even after washing shrinkage, they fit like a tent, and are only usable under a thick sweater. When I tuck this shirt into pants, the form factor reminds me of a halloween pumpkin costume. I had hoped they would fit like the ""croft & barrow"" shirts I bought somewhere in the US, but if I've learned anything from my forays into the US, it's that hope is not a strategy."
3.0,Good quality but too boxy. Is not slim fit at all.
3.0,"Uncomfortable, seem to be some cotton/polyester blend."
5.0,Great product.
4.0,"Very nice quality.  Purchased the product because my husband had always had a good fit with Calvin Klein.  They washed beautifully.  It is a trite complaint but it did seem odd that all 3 shirts had the imprinted name and information (instead of the bothersome tag) and the printing was off center and slanted downhill??? The only problem with that would be if it showed through his dress shirts, but I doubt that will happen.  Really impressed with the softness and the extra length."
5.0,"These v-neck shirts are must haves in every man's closet. They always come in handy as casual wear over jeans or as undergarment for more formal attires. the quality is good and soft and comfortable. They are a perfect fit too for normal-sized men. I am a medium, I got medium and it fit well."
1.0,"Update: Zero Stars !!
First order: I purchased three three-packs of these tee shirts. One pack contains three shirts that had clearly been used at least once and laundered. Pits and other stains and smell of laundry detergent. Gross and outrageous.
Replacement order: ""3-pack"" of shirts arrived with only 2 shirts inside. Now I have to send back a second package. Furious."
5.0,"Just tried one on, seems to fit quite well.  Fabric feels nice.  Hope it stays that way after washing."
4.0,good for me
5.0,My favorite black v necks out there.
5.0,Great undershirt! Highly recommended. Nice and comfortable.
5.0,Love them! First V-neck that I ever got and don't regret. The best part are the colour and the material: the colour is deep black and the material is good cotton. Going to buy another set right now.
5.0,"Had purchased another brand, same size large, but were cut shorter, just enough to be annoying. CK size large is perfect. 5'9"", 188lbs."
5.0,"Nice, well-constructed garment using very good materials.  I have worn this model for years ang go back to them as now trusted.  They do tend to thin out after several years light use, washing every week."
4.0,"Nice white tees, good quality cotton lasts long"
5.0,Perfect! They are nice and long so no worries about that.
5.0,"Great T shirt, I love it."
5.0,"Bought these for my husband, he loves CK t-shirts. Soft and not too thick, hold up nicely to washing."
4.0,Good quality and comfortable
4.0,Nice shape
5.0,"Enjoy the fit, weight of fabric and quality"
5.0,"Smooth, soft t-shirts, long so they stay tucked in."
4.0,"shrink after wash, always take that into consideration!"
5.0,Nice
5.0,I love the feel of these tees. They fit just as I was expecting them to. hopefully they will last a while because i like wearing these as more of a casual look like an everyday tee.
3.0,"These fit ok out of the box but after a few washings mine shrunk considerably.  They come untucked all the time now and they've simultaneously seem to have gotten wider and more billowy.  I've come to find that Calvin Klein in general does not fit me well.

The material is nice though and if they fit you well even after washing they seem like they should last a good while."
5.0,"I've been wearing these shirts for years. They are the perfect around-the-house, comfortable shirt, and they're more stylish IMO than a typical white t-shirt. The cotton is soft and feels great. They have double stitching and have stood up to lots of machine washing. I love that there's no paper/plastic tag: the printed one inside the shirt is genius. My shirts have ""Made in Haiti"" on them FWIW."
5.0,"Great Shirt Fits perfect, fast and reliable seller/shipper."
5.0,"Comfortable, looks good, hard to find anything to complain about."
3.0,"Loose, hopefully shrink a bit in the wash"
5.0,nice t-shirt.
5.0,LOVE these.  Cannot go back to any other brand after having these against my skin.  Great purchase!
4.0,"very comfortable.  good for lounge wear, sleep wear, or to the gym"
5.0,fits very well
2.0,"too large,"
5.0,These V-neck shirts can and will transform almost any outfit into one which kicks ass. I was surprised as to how well they fit for the price.
4.0,Fit as expected !
5.0,"Good length. Good quality. Sometimes t shirts can be too short, especially after a little shrinking in the wash."
5.0,100% OK
4.0,Good quality and softness but too big. Returning for smaller size
5.0,Gift for brother in law.
4.0,"Very good,physical and pictures the samemy husband like it."
5.0,the price was great.
5.0,I love the fabric
3.0,It is not worth the money. I found $7 per T-shirt better product. Heavier more durable material. The V neck is too big. After 2 - 3 wash the T-shirt let loose its form.
3.0,too fittoo long
4.0,Nice fit and texture. A classic package with CK brand on it.
1.0,There are two holes after washing. See photos below.
5.0,My Husband really like his V-Neck T-Shirts
4.0,"a little bit large . will send to my father , thanks anyway"
4.0,very good
3.0,good quality
5.0,Comfortable.
4.0,My husband likes. But some big.
4.0,Love these shirts.  Comfortable and fit well.
5.0,"somewhat large,but It's good T-Shirt"
5.0,I love it!
5.0,"I have always wore Hanes for under shirts. They always shrank after they dried. So I picked up these gems and they fit great, they don't shrink after washing as much and they look great enough to wear as just a shirt for the day. Exceed my expectations by far."
5.0,GREAT! GRREAT! GREAT! I LIKE IT!
5.0,"Happy with my purchase.,  I especially like the texture and smooth feel of the cotton."
1.0,Clothes are too large Can only be thrown away
4.0,"but what I received was 2-pack,there was no black one!"
5.0,"I am  6' 2""  with a tall and slender build and weight 185 pounds. The shirts fight me well, but are a little big in the neck area for me. I would assume the shirt would fit an average man better than me.  I would buy these again and these did not shrink when washed and dried 100%."
5.0,"Its not very good,large"
4.0,"Like the shirts, just chose the wrong size by mistake."
5.0,"Something about this 100% cotton feels a lot nicer than the average 100% undershirt you might find. I never really cared about undershirts (other than that they be 100% cotton) but after getting this one, I threw away all my other ones and got more of these. Still happy with them a year later."
5.0,The best
4.0,too large
5.0,Great Seller and product!
5.0,Taikored well enough to be worn as a t-shirt or undershirt.
5.0,"I bought this for my brother to wear as an undershirt for when he has to wear dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and he loves them.  His favorite part about these shirts is that you can barely feel the material in comparison to all of his cotton shirts.  So, they're definitely light/thin material.  He would never wear them as a regular shirt unless it's in a casual setting (e.g. to bed).

Regardless, they work GREAT for wearing under buttoned dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and I'll definitely be buying the white ones for him soon enough.

Oh, as for the fit, I obviously can't personally comment on it, but for him the XL worked great.  He's all around a huge guy (height, weight, and his shoulders) and while he normally wears XLs, sometimes they fit too tight on him due to his shoulders and neck.  This XL fit perfectly with a little room to spare, so if you're a bigger person with regards to your height and shoulders, get your normal size, otherwise definitely size down."
3.0,the xl is cut for a fat person
5.0,These under shirts fit perfectly and are very soft and comfortable.  Love them!
5.0,"Fitso perfect, washeso great!"
5.0,"Good quality I always wear L and I bought M based on other reviews. M fits percect (on the small side, but perfect). I'm 176 cm and 83 Kg."
2.0,too large
1.0,I ordered the v nick style but the one I received is round.  I hated it
1.0,too large
4.0,Great
5.0,THERE'S NOT A LOT TO SAY OTHER THAN THE ITEM IS WELL PRICED & ARRIVED PROMPTLY
4.0,I normally spend a lot more on Calvin Klein so was incredibly pleased to be able to get them at such good value.
5.0,none is better.
4.0,"i bought ""s"", my Chest is 40, it's a little long."
5.0,nice
5.0,"Fits as expected, Solid Product"
5.0,husband loved them.
4.0,Very soft and comfortable.
1.0,"These are not made in Haiti -- they're made in Bangladesh.

They did feel different than the ones I'd gotten in past orders, but I thought I'd give them a try anyway. Definitely thinner and less soft compared to those made in Haiti. Not sure what explains the difference in quality between the two origins.

In any case, the product description should be updated!"
5.0,"Fits, looks nice and cheap."
5.0,They are perfect except just a tad bit too large
5.0,good
3.0,okay
5.0,great quality for very low money. i wear them daily.
3.0,"I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's size XL based on the 71% ""Fit as expected"" opinion rank.

I'm 6'3"" and 245 lbs and usually wear size XL in most men's t-shirts. I find these t-shirts too baggy and made of a thin material so they are definitively not intended to be worn as a typical weekend stand alone t-shirt."
5.0,it is comfortable
5.0,"I'm not one of those women who puts on sparkling spandex to work out.  When I work out, it's about working out, and I want something soft and loose that I can move and sweat in.

I got these in XL and they fit the bill.  They are perfect as sleep shirts as well.

And they are still nice and soft after washing."
4.0,"They are good quality but shrunk more than expected, so they don't fit... maybe I should have expected that.?"
4.0,as expected
2.0,It's M?
3.0,Por quality
4.0,"These undershirts have held their shape and their color in the wash, They are comfy and look good enough to be worn as regular t-shirts."
5.0,Worth the extra money over cheaper T shirts
2.0,I don't like it at all and I return to Amazon without any heisitate
5.0,"These shirts fit very nice and they are very comfortable as well. Have been washed approx. 20-30 times and they are not at all balled up or showing any signs of wear. I have these in other colors as well and they are just as good. If you need or want a nice v-neck t-shirt, look no further."
5.0,Just so easy.  Awesome.
5.0,Fits Perfectly and Feels Very Comfortable
5.0,Nice thickness of shirts. Double stitched hems. Fit well. Would recommend.
5.0,"There's enough sleeve holes for each of my arms. The quality is ok, the V is not too low. Overall satisfied."
3.0,"I was expecting similar quality with the CK 365 undershirt I had. These are not! They run way too large to begin with. I am 5'10"" and at ~170 lbs, typically wear size M, but boy these are more like L. I wasn't impressed with the material either. The 365 version wears very closely to the body, and you don't really feel you're wearing an undershirt. Also they had a slight yellowish tint which I didn't like either. All in all, I ended up with returning them and got 6-pack Kirkland from Costco for $20 - a purchase that I am pretty happy about."
5.0,"I have already ordered a smaller size, but it seems still large to me, I should probably order a smaller size than that of this one."
4.0,"Somewhat large, but great"
5.0,Great for my slim fit boy!
4.0,nice and fresh
5.0,"Just as descrived, nice softh fabric."
4.0,It's different with the one I got from ck store. Not sure why.
4.0,often times i get 3 packs and all the shirts are different lengths.  these were all around the same length and the material is soft and comfortable.
5.0,it's a little bit big
5.0,"I bought these at Costco years ago, and loved them.  Costco of course no long carries them, so I was very happy to see I could get some new ones on Amazon. They cost a little more on Amazon than they did at Costco, but they were worth it to me."
5.0,very good
5.0,It's very good
5.0,I went to Hawaii and needed some darker light weight shirts. THESE ARE PERFECT and fit well. (maybe a little tiny bit larger but that is fine) I would buy this again and made a good purchase at a great price. (I am a female large on top) Love the v-neck too!
4.0,They are light and cool for our weather.
4.0,"My husband goes through quite a lot of these tshirts. I noticed the last time I ordered, they came out of the dryer (with an all white load of clothes) with a  pinkish tint. He used them anyway and I continued to wash them. Eventually that tint went away. I ordered 3 packs this time. 2 were made in Bangladesh and one in Haiti. Sure enough, after I threw them in the dryer to fluff up, all 3 of the Haiti-made shirts had the pink tint, while the Bangladesh ones were still white. Who knows...."
3.0,"They are a bit looser than I had expected, but bose I washed them once, they fit better."
5.0,"Great fit, works great under dress shirt due to the thin nature of the shirt. The V-neck isn't to deep, washed up very well, no shrinkage, or wrinkles."
3.0,"The quality in general is good, the fit okay, but they are too large"
5.0,Good quality and fit as expected. Very nice shirts for the price.
3.0,"size is ok, and very comfortable."
1.0,T-shirts are not the size expected for a size L. They are too big!
5.0,"These shirts are great V-Neck's that fit perfectly, are comfortable, and look great!

They can be used as a black under-shirt, if ever needed, but I love to wear these as every day shirts.  The nice cotton design is comfortable and washes great. After many washes I still find the shirt to be comfortable and fit the same way as always (the first wash/dry might make it - like all shirts - shrink a little).

These are some of my favorite shirts to wear, and I wear them all the time.

They fit as you would expect, I purchased medium (as I purchase medium shirts always) and it fit as it should.  At first it was a little too big, but after the first wash/dry it shaped properly and fits perfectly now.

The material is thick, and it doesn't' feel cheap at all, while it is nice and soft and great for sleeping in too (your significant other will love the softness of the material!).

When I purchased them, they were on sale and a great value - but even at regular price these shirts are definitely a great buy and can be worn as an every day shirt, as a black under shirt, or as a nice comfortable at home/night shirt.  I have recommend these (and the white versions, as undershirts) to my friends and purchase new ones every so often when I lose them, or people take them!

Lastly, they are made to last! I have had some of these for more than a year (coming up on almost two years, actually) and they still look great and fit perfectly -- after about a year I usually retire them to night shirts and get new fresh ones (as I tend to stain them here and there and wear them so much that I like to purchase fresh ones to wear out -- don't don't let that make you think they don't last, I could absolutely still wear them out if I wanted to!).

Calvin Klein is a great brand, and makes great V-Necks (in all colors!)."
5.0,The fabric is not good
5.0,These shirts fit perfectly and are a great buy.
1.0,To large for me
2.0,"Oversized and Overpriced.

Worst packing for shipment ever."
4.0,"Great fabric and weight. If I reorder I'll get a size smaller. I'm 6'5"" and 235 and I felt like these were a little too baggy. Ilk see how they do after I wash them."
5.0,"these 100% cotton v-neck t-shirts are cool and comfortable.

They are a good, roomy fit."
5.0,"I bought several sets for my husband, who's very particular about fabric texture. They're soft and just the right weight for ""loungewear""...not too thick or too thin and they hold their shape well after washing or drying. He loves them."
5.0,Quality and fit are fine and I am pleased with the product.
5.0,Excellent fit and value.
5.0,"This is the undershirt I've been buying for almost ten years now. Was on a business trip with no time to send out laundry and had to order new underwear. Shirts and shorts arrived on time and were just as expected: soft, treated cotton, form-fitting cut and no bunching or noticeable seams. Prime is worth every penny."
4.0,"These shirts are a bit too big and baggy. Should have gone with a medium.
Good quality though. Very soft."
5.0,"a very good purchasing exeprience,which beyond my expection."
5.0,Nice T-Shirt. So softy.
4.0,good
4.0,good
3.0,It's okay
1.0,"One washing and they shrank way way too much.  Good only for seeing if you can hit a trash can with a wadded up t-shirt, which is where they went.  3 for 3.  Swish!  Swish!  Swish!"
2.0,They were very large and could not be worn as an undershirt
4.0,"Clothes, good quality, very comfortable to wear cotton clothes size slightly larger"
4.0,nice look- good fit.
4.0,always good!
5.0,Great T's!  Fast shipping.
4.0,Very comfortable though too large
3.0,I am 180cm high and weight is 80KG.  the l/g size is too large for me although I always fit as L in other clothes
2.0,"I was disappointed, because I was supposed to get one white, one grey and one black shirt and all three were white. Could not be botthered to exchange. They were not as long as I would have liked. Am female and wear them as nightsirts. They'have to do.  SC"
5.0,"CK is a favorite underwear brand of mine for years because of repeat-washing durability along with use of good quality, comfortable cotton. These v-necked tee shirts are no exception. I'd buy them again. Would have preferred slightly more length in the body, but I am long-waisted. Perhaps a tall size would have been better for me, but then the short sleeves tend to be too long, so I went with the XL. I would purchase these again, and probably will."
4.0,Some how it is 8cm longer than what I bought from CK store. The material is a bit different. But it is still a nice T-shirt
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Suitable for me
5.0,"very good product, it could recommend"
3.0,"I order small i thought is going well but it comes like bigger than me. I don't have choise to choose ""X small"""
5.0,"fiance wears these. Great/perfect fit, soft."
5.0,Soft and quality cotton. Would recommend and repurchase.
4.0,GOOD
4.0,"The clothes some long, quality is good, comfortable to wear."
5.0,"Well designed , good quality cotton , true to size and fit . Minimal shrinking if you do not dry in dryer."
5.0,"Well, when you buy a CK, you get a CK; what else can I say?"
3.0,"I'm 6'0"" and 180lbs and I ordered the medium.  The fabric is very soft and seems to be of high quality, but the shirt is very loose and kind of blousey.  Not a fan."
2.0,"The shirts fit nicely right out of the package but after 1 wash, 2 of the 3 shirts shrunk so much that they're no longer wearable."
4.0,"In addition to larger, I liked"
4.0,great t-shirt
5.0,"Fit very well, very comfortable"
4.0,"These fit well and the colors look nice, although the newness of the material wears off pretty fast which is disappointing from CK. Nevertheless its fine to wear as an undershirt or at home"
3.0,"Fabric is stretchier than I had expected, and the shirt fits on the small side."
4.0,he loved the fit. the v isn't too low and the colors are nice. comfy and soft but not too thin.
4.0,It is a very comfortable shirt.  It fits a little large.  I am pleased with the purchase.
5.0,"The shirts are nice and comfortable!, I chose ""large""... to not risk the buy, because in my country ""large"" fits me well, but when the item arrived, it was a little bit larger than the local large shirts...

I will definitely buy another pack... but i'll choose ""medium"" instead..."
4.0,nicebut small
4.0,slightly  long
1.0,"The material is thinner than it used to be and after washing it once, it shrank a couple inches in length. I won't be getting this brand again which is sad because my husband used to love it."
5.0,"These fit well, seem to be made of good quality and thickness fabric, and are sewn with high enough quality that I could wear them by themselves and not just as an undershirt."
5.0,My husband loves Calvin Klein t-shirts because the fit is just right and they are a little bit longer than other brands. This one is a winner in our house.
1.0,"Way too big and definetly not ""V"" neck"
1.0,Too big.
5.0,"great t-shirt! fits me well! I am 168cm tall, thin, and s size is perfect for my body type"
4.0,zhiliang soso
4.0,Does the job!
4.0,These are the best undershirts available.  Could be an inch or two longer - but they are a good 3 inches longer than comparable Hanes (after washing).
5.0,Great
5.0,none
5.0,100% recomended
5.0,I wear these every day and love 'em.
5.0,Commodity excellent try it was very elegant and beautiful
5.0,These shirts fit well and wash well. Could not ask for more.
3.0,Good fit and quality but the neck area was to narrow for me.
5.0,"Yeah.. the name still holds some sway.. even if just for these T's .. fit well , wash well .. all good .. get them , a bit pricy though"
2.0,WAY TOO BIG.
5.0,My husband has to wear white V-necks every day for work. He's tried every brand and Calvin Klein are the softest and the brightest white. They also last longer through washes than the other brands.
4.0,Shrink them in the dryer a few times (three for me). Then they are small enough to be called small... Otherwise no complaints. I am a male with a 36 inch chest.
2.0,I typically buy black and whil ck t's because of the fit and how well they wear/last but the colored t's are average cotton t's at best...including shrinkage
5.0,I love the Calvin Kline white V-neck tees the run bigger than I would like last year I got the extra-large and those were too big this year I got the large fit me a lot better and they last a long time. I'll be getting them again next year
4.0,"Fit is great. Black and grey shirts are exactly as I hoped, but the white shirt is a bit thin."
5.0,"This is a great quality undershirt that I bought in white but they run a little big though, so if your into fitted sizes like me go one size down."
5.0,BF likes these
5.0,I use these as workout shirts. They're comfy and the right price. :)
4.0,Wears comfortable while a little larger than expected.
3.0,"The fit is very nice, however the small marks where the tape held the shirts in a fold during shipping have not washed away and do not appear to be going away after 4 washings so far. I guess they will make good work shirts."
5.0,The first time I ordered them I ordered my size which is usually a large and it was too big. I returned it and got medium which fit perfectly
3.0,almost size xlarge
4.0,"i should choose ""s ""size."
4.0,Nice choice for casual and home wear !!
5.0,"Love these so much I should order more. The fit is fantastic, and they are very soft."
5.0,Excellent quality
4.0,Great t-shirts!
3.0,A lot larger than described
1.0,"I couldn't wear these out or under anything because they're enormous. The only place you can wear them will be to bed, and even then you'll look silly. I wish I could return them, but I tried shrinking them and that didn't work - avoid, unless you're big and tall... These should be marked Big and tall - CK used to make a great fitting shirt, but this is not it!"
5.0,Love them.
5.0,goooood
5.0,I purchase as a gift for my son. Perfect fit and he wears them as everyday t-shirts.
5.0,My wife uses these as bed clothes in the Summer and just loves them.  Not only are they kind of cool looking the material Calvin Klein uses is so soft and nice.  She liked them so much I ended up buying some for myself except for day time wear and I love the feel and fit of them too.  Great product.
3.0,Good quality.on time
4.0,"If you are going to get a v-neck,
Get Calvin Klein"
3.0,"Large before washing, good after shrinking in a normal Wash. Quality is just acceptable."
5.0,Nice shirts. I will buy more.
5.0,These tees are soft and comfortable. Hubby liked them so well we ordered a second package within a week of receiving the first package. The length is enough to tuck in without extra bulk.
5.0,Great Tee shirt!
5.0,The material is soft and comfortable!
4.0,like the material and fit well.  Didn't like the price $$$
4.0,"I enjoy wearing these shirts. I did not notice a lot of shrinkage after the first wash. My only disappointment is that they come wastefully packaged with a large amount of throw-away cardboard inside.

On some T-shirts, the sleeves are long enough that they peek out from the t-shirt sleeve. It depends on your arm musculature and length of t-shirt sleeve, obviously."
4.0,"Good quality, i like how these t-shirts fits on me, no more to say."
4.0,"Great tees for sure! The only downside is that it is somehow larger than the size you choose! I didn't wash them yet so maybe they shrink a little bit.

Material is nice. I bought this as home clothes so it is just right for me :)"
5.0,Excellent!
4.0,"A little bit large for a Medium size, i believe. Im 5ft7"
5.0,I wear an XL in all my shirts but I was reading the reviews & saw people was saying it runs big so yeah it do thanks goodness I orderd a L the L fits just right so if I wear a XL make sure u order a L great shirt i like it
4.0,Excellent!
5.0,"Good quality T-Shirt.  Fabric is nice cotton.  I am 6' and 160lbs.  I wear a form fitting pilot uniform shirt over this t-shirt.  No issues.
I would buy this product again.  No issue with length.  If you have an exceptionally long torso there might be but if you are normal not issues."
5.0,"The length is really good, these shirts are perfect for wearing under button up shirts. They have a long enough tail to stay tucked in through hours of sitting at a desk, even through jumping up every time the boss calls. The material is thin enough to feel like it will last while not being too thick to be able to tuck in with another shirt over. Will definitely order more."
5.0,"Soft, long and stays black after many washes."
5.0,Pretty good
5.0,My favorite under shirts. Comfortable and high quality. Last forever. I will never go back to Hanes or Fruit of the Loom after wearing these. Worth the extra $$ since they last longer and are far more comfortable. Right length and stay tucked in all day.
5.0,good
4.0,fit well. accetable quality
4.0,Great products in terms of quality and price.
5.0,"I have worn CKs for years and swear by the brand.  Yes, they may cost more at first, but they far outlast the store house brands, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom."
4.0,It's a white t-shirt alright.
5.0,Thanks
4.0,very happy with the shirts
4.0,Worth the price.
4.0,"I'm normally between a Medium to a Large, and I read that they run a little large for a slim fit, which is true, so I ordered a medium and when they arrived (A day earlier then expected) I tried them on and the were a little loose, but they weren't ridiculous. I'm happy with them though."
5.0,"Been wearing the Calvin Klein t-shirts for years and love them!  They fit as expected, don't stretch out OR shrink, are durable, and for some reson stay very white!  The V-Necks are great to layer with or wear alone!"
4.0,"I love CK t-shirts. They are very soft and comfortable. It is hard to determine if the size is ""true."" With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0"" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes/dries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing/drying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying."
5.0,Every thing was received as I expected. Very good service and good price
4.0,buy for friend
3.0,Great material but too large!
5.0,good
5.0,"i love it, good product"
2.0,"Product is fine, sizing is not consistent with other CK shirts I have bought.  These t shirts run very large."
5.0,"Got them at the sweet price point, making them better value than most others. Material is of very good quality and the cutting and finishing is very good too. Only CK tees for me!"
5.0,Good Quality Shirts
5.0,ok
4.0,The light one is perfect  the medium one is not as well made the dark one is real bad not well made at all
2.0,"Much bigger than any xl t-shirt I've ever worn. Even after shrinking, still fits like a larger xxl. I gave 2 stars because it's a soft,  thick cotton."
5.0,Will shrink after firs wash. Get one size larger.
5.0,very good thank you
5.0,Best T-Shirts ever
4.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend and the medium size fits him quite well in the shoulders but is a lot longer than anticipated (he is 5' 11.5"").  He likes his t-shirts longer though so it was a good purchase.  The fabric is nice and they wash well."
4.0,Great Feel & Comfortable !
5.0,great
4.0,The shirts almost fit perfect. For some reason the sleeves are a bit shorter than I would like. This causes the sleeves to ride up and the need to pull them back down a must several times. Cotton is good quality holding up to multiple washings.
5.0,"I bought medium sized, I'm a 5'10 with a size 29 waist and thought it would fit me perfectly. The other reviews were right, the shirt is a bit of a tall fit and it felt like i was wearing a large shirt so i ended up giving the medium sized to my brother.
I ordered small the same day and it just came in and i was definitely more pleased with it, since i like to wear shirts that are less baggy.
Definitely try to buy the smaller size if you are skinny and don't like baggy shirts"
5.0,"Soft, and no tags.  Wonderful, my hubby loves them!  Sometimes I borrow them to sleep in, too!"
5.0,Most t-shirts and underwear are cheap.  CK is great.
5.0,GOOD
3.0,I didn't like it
5.0,"They are really comfortable to wear, and the price is good also!"
2.0,large
5.0,all good
5.0,"Realy soft, I like it"
5.0,"I wear undershirts every work day.  These are top quality.  Some reviews state they run big, fit me perfectly.  I prefer roomy fit as they will shrink after a number of washes.  I gave been wearing these shirts for about 6 years, they last 18 months-ish.  Never had a issue with the quality of the shirts."
3.0,I normally wear a large. This shirt in a large is what the industry would call XL or XXL. buy accordingly.
5.0,"I bought this on sale and this is one of the best purchase I ever made on Amazon!  The shirt is 100% cotton so it's very soft, not too thick and not too thin.  The quality is just perfect!  Also, I'm glad that I didn't listen to most Amazon reviewers, the size is as advertised, it is not running large."
5.0,good
5.0,a little large but very soft and comfortable.
5.0,I liked a lot these t-shirts... they are very confortable and fit very well in the body.
5.0,"Nice to wear under dark shirts and can pass as a polo shirt in a pinch. Very good construction and stitching, which is appreciated as some off brands (with lower prices) can't stand the test of time or multiple washes. In the end quality is less expensive, as you don't have to replace shirts as often, due to separated seams or fraying at the V point in the shirt."
2.0,they are larger than a usual L
5.0,"Nice product,worth the price"
5.0,Buenisimas
5.0,"Tese shirts are so soft and comfortable. Great colors, as well."
5.0,I really like these undershirts.  I have purchased them multiple times.  Very comfortable and they are well made.  They keep their true white color far better than other shirts I have purchased.
4.0,Ok
5.0,"My friend 186 75kg
Little large"
3.0,"too lager. I'm 188cm, 90kg."
3.0,i am 180cm 160lbs but it too large for me
5.0,Ok
4.0,Nice shirts
5.0,"Real nice undershirts.  Soft and they are longer which helps them stay tucked in. I like these better than fruit of the loom or hanes. Also, I started tucking my undershirts into my underwear to keep them tucked in. I just hate when the undershirt gets un-tucked and your dress shit does not. Then I get this weird bulge around my waste. These are the best undershirts I've tried tho."
4.0,Excelent product
5.0,good
5.0,My boyfriend loves these V necks and I can never find them in stores like marshalls and tj max in his size so we ordered them online. Perfect
5.0,I buy three V necks to wear around the house every year. Last year I bought these shirts in Large and White. They were a bit bigger than I wanted and got dirty quickly. This year I bought Medium and Black. The fit is great; not too tight in the stomach area or shoulders. I am average build and wear a 42 long suit coat. These shirts are great. Hopefully they do not fade too much from weekly washing. I will check back in if there is anything to report down the road.
5.0,Very good :D
2.0,The size is two x bigger than what it should be
2.0,Bad quality. Too big. Does not seem as Calvin Klein product
5.0,Good T-shirts
1.0,2 sizes bigger than usual
4.0,I've only worn them once after they've gone through the wash and dryer.  They don't fit tight like some of the stretch Calvin Klein or similar v-neck I've been looking for but they are definitely quality and are what I was expecting to buy.  Calvin Klein also makes the best boxer briefs I own.  Would recommend.
1.0,I purchased the same T's from Macy's which were made in Haiti and they were twice as thick. These are made in Bangladesh. They are thinner than the one's I just threw away. I would only recommend these to my boss.
1.0,"The problem with this v neck is simple: The ""v"" is not nearly deep enough. I wear a v neck in order to have the comfort of a tshirt without letting everyone know I am wearing one--otherwise I'd buy a crew neck. I've literally taken the scissors to these things to get them so they don't show when I wear them with more casual sport shirts. Unless you are only going to wear them with dress shirts and only the very top button undone, get something else. Don't let the brand name deceive you here."
5.0,"Beautiful color, perfect size. I buyed size LARGE.
This beautiful t shirt and nice brand. Calvin Klein always with nice shirts."
5.0,"The size fits well around to me ,The quality is somewhat cheap. But worth the price. It is the perfect size ."
4.0,"It's not the first time I buy thoses shirts.

Very confortable and they are great to wear as an under shirt."
5.0,"I wear these all the time for work and play. They fit a little big at first, but as my beer belly grows they are snugging up perfectly."
4.0,"The shirts fit good and the material feels sturdy and feels like they are going to be long lasting wear, I'd like to say:  Thank you to the makers of these fine shirts..."
5.0,These t-shirts are nice enough to wear as shirts with shorts for hot weather.  They wash up wear and the colors go with any pair of shorts.
5.0,"I bought it for my boyfriend, and he likes it very much. It fit him a lot, and very cool for summer."
5.0,"at first, I lost my mind and ordered large.. duh, so my neighbor won the lotto for new, super nice, soft t-shirts.. so I re=ordered and the xl is the perfect size.

I have matching white leggins so I dyed all 3 a different color, so I have 'outfits' that all match.. love the fit and the SOFT!!

thanks!"
5.0,"Many t-shirts are thin and flimsy or at the other end, too heavy. These are just right and the quality overall is excellent."
3.0,"I've ordered this shirt pack twice. The first order was in early 2014, then again on June 4th, 2014. The shirts in the first order were correctly sized while in the second order they were much bigger. The cause of this is probably because of a change in manufacturing location that could be seen on the shirt collar. The shirts in the first order were made in Haiti while the second order was made in Bangladesh."
5.0,"Can't beat the price for CKlein T's  on Amazon, not as soft as older versions but very durable. A bit longer than expected."
5.0,"It fits as expected, and the material is soft and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it for an undershirt or sleeping."
5.0,"Calvin Klein Men's 3-Pack Classic V-Neck T-Shirt, White
The right size!
The right size! Reliable quality! I love it. I hope you will buy."
5.0,"Excellent, showed up on time. Well made, didn't shrink or fade so far. Definitely will buy again. And again. And again!"
5.0,All of my shirts are XL and these are actually slightly big. they got fine with a few washes though and are very comfortable
2.0,"I am 6'2"" 180 lbs. I bought the mediums. They fit like XXL. Returned and bought ralph lauren v neck and they fit perfect."
5.0,I've tried these on a few times before buying them. I must have tried different standard white v-necks as one medium seems to fit a lot tighter (which is desired for an undershirt) than others. I bought another two sets from Marshalls and they appeared to be the exact same product but fit a lot looser. They are very comfortable and I kept both.
2.0,"I am long in the torso and this T-shirt is shorter than size large by some other brands.  It's too skimpy for me but if it were 2"" longer, I'd buy more because otherwise it's a good shirt."
4.0,"The Shirts are a great fit. No doubt about that. However, I feel they are not very durable. It might get worn out soon. However, I will have to wait and see that."
2.0,"as a Chinese,it's too wider for me,but the length is ok,just not my type. So if you're a big man,it's for you."
4.0,I think it's a good idea to spend more money on things that you use all the time. This feels SO nice and my husband gas been using as nightshirts with sweats and I love how soft they are .
5.0,"I can't complain about anything it was all to my liking i must say when it come's to Amazon Prime it set the mode right for everything to fall in line and for that i am thankful for ""Amazon Prime"" thank you ""Prime""keep up the Good Stuff"
5.0,"I bought them for my boyfriend. He is a body builder and has a good sized upper body. These shirts fit him nicely. Not too tight and not too small. He loved the look and feel, oh and so do I! For the money, they are a great value. I'm debating on buying the 3-pack of blue V-necks too!"
4.0,"Comfortable and high quality. A little long at first, but I know from experience they'll shrink a little to a perfect fit.."
4.0,"My height is 178 cm, weight 90 kg, M number just purchased. This dress is cotton, but after a little deformed after washing neckline."
4.0,Performs as advertised. It's freaking underwear - you buy the right size and it fits. What more can be said?
4.0,"Great undershirt to consider making part of your wardrobe, that doesn't fade too quickly (too yellow, that is) and does not cost you an arm and leg for something that's considered a basic-necessity in a civilized world."
5.0,"These shirts are luxuriously soft. The fabric is a little thin, but I live in a warm climate and only wear them as undershirts. They are much softer than the Hanes shirts I bought recently. I will buy only these from now on."
5.0,I took these out of the package and they seemed to be a few inches too long and about an inch too wide. I put them through the wash on a warm cycle and they came out fitting exactly as a medium should fit.
5.0,"Nice cool and comfortable shirt. Use it as an undershirt for work, keeps you cool and breathable. Definitely buy some more."
5.0,These undershirts are a must have for any man who likes comfort and that clean feeling. my husband is very particular about his under clothes and these are great. the material is soft and it fits just right
4.0,"Nice shirts, nice quality but I wish I hadn't listened to the reviews that said the shirts run large. I normally wear a large but I ordered size medium based on reviews that advised me to do so. Well, I need a size Large. I'll be ordering more in my actual size."
5.0,"I love these V neck shirts. The fitted look is good. The sleeves are a little tight, but not to where I think I am going to tear them. They don't wear out quickly."
5.0,"very happy with my purchase.
Hope you keep them in stock for the future. Also
like the three pack of black v-necks!"
4.0,"i like so much this t-shirt. Calvin Kein is one of my favorite brand, for sure i will buy in a future."
3.0,"The cotton is fine, the thickness is fine but the length is easily 4 inches too long.  They need to trim 4 inches and it would be perfect."
3.0,"the material is ok, but is too large, is recomender the refer the size in a additional table, 185 cm and 85 kg"
5.0,"Best T-shirts ever: they are comfortable,they  look good, they fit well, and are suitable for many occasions. A good price for comfortable and attractive clothing."
1.0,Fit me too big. I want to return for a smaller size. Shirts run bigger so I recommend you get a size smaller then your normal.
5.0,"Fits so good againsst my ssssskin sso sssoft.  Mmm...makes me want to role around on my bed in nothing but this shirt,  Seriously, it fits well, looks good, hangs well, very soft.  Don't be surprised about how this it is.  The thinness is exactly what I was looking for but others may not.  I will definitely buy more some day.  Not for awhile though...the last set of three I bout 12 years ago I'm still wearing around the house as my comfy pj top."
5.0,I love the cut of these T-shirts. I will be buying again. By the way the colors are awesome. Thanks
5.0,"The cotton is very comfortable, the size is also fit. My husband like this brand very much. We will buy again."
5.0,"i think it's a little  thin, nipple could be seen clearly.but it's ok.
the quality is good,the shape is good.."
5.0,Calvin Klein products always deliver.  The T's fit perfect.  I've bought many CK products and they all fit and work perfectly.
3.0,"It is difficult to find Calvin Klein XL shirts around here, and the larges are a bit too short for my tall boyfriend. These fit great and are true to CK quality. However, I ordered the 3-pack with darker grey and blue, and I received black, white, and light gray. That is my only complaint about this order. Other than that, it was a great buy.
If I had received colors ordered, I would rate 5 stars."
5.0,"These T-shirts are a great value. Have been buying them over the years and find they hold up much better than other brands. And purchased through Amazon, they are a great deal as well."
2.0,"I bought these as undershirts to wear under a dress shirt and tucked into dress pants or khakis.

After a couple washes these shrunk in length and now I have the annoying problem of the shirt becoming untucked or wrinkled up at my belt line.

If you are looking for a casual v-neck to wear untucked with jeans or whathaveyou, these might do the trick.  As an undershirt, I will stick with the the Dockers V-necks."
3.0,"It is too large to wearI will wear it when I sleepI buy it for it named CK, whatever ,...."
4.0,"Nice fabric, very fresh, however does seems to run a little big. I order a medium being a 6ft guy however next time (there will be a next time) i'm buying them small"
4.0,I got 3 of these sets and I really regret it. They were much longer than expected. It almost seems a 'tall' size. Very disappointed that amazon does not clearly state that.
5.0,"These are the only brand I wear, the most comfortable. Highly recommend. They hold up nice in the wash as well"
5.0,"Clothes quality is very good, suitable for 170-175 cm tall, weighs75 kg of the following figure, the item is consistent with the description, logistics speed is very fast, I like it very much. Next time I will continue to buy the product."
5.0,"I bought these for the price. They are good, soft and comfortable! When needed I will buy again! Very nice!"
5.0,"Great material. Unexpectedly long, but this means it'll stayed tucked in -- like an undershirt should. I'd prefer it tighter as an undershirt but right now it's just really comfortable."
1.0,"The quality of this product is disappointed, add to that, this is made for big guys
I am 5""9 tall and wide shoulder, but' too big for me"
4.0,"Bought these for my son as a Christmas gift and he wears them all the time.  They wash well and are nice and soft, these colors are hard to find these days so if you get lucky and find them, buy them!"
4.0,"they are just nice cottony, good feel, v necks as described.  if you like v necks, do it.  no problems, launder nicely"
4.0,"Long enough to stay tucked in, and snug enough so there is no bunching. The v-neck is about as deep as the second button on most dress shirts. Better quality material and stitching than cheaper brands."
3.0,"If you like the slim fit kind of shirt this is not the one you should buy. Other than that, cotton feels nice."
5.0,They fit my son prefect it just what he wanted thank you.. I will keep on buying from Calvin Klein
5.0,Having bought many sleeping shirts before. These top all of them before in terms of tactile feel and quality. It's a dream to wear them to bed.
5.0,do you have any more at that price? thanks.thought they might be a little big but they were just right
5.0,These shirts are very comfortable!  The colors are very vibrant!  So far they haven't lost their shape.  Nice to wear as an undershirt or nightshirt.
5.0,"These are some of the best tshirts on the market.  So glad I found them on Amazon.  Smooth, comfortable and good fit."
5.0,These are excellent shirts. They are definitely for under clothing wear. The quality of the fabric and construction far outshine anything I've purchased in the last 15 years. Do yourself a favor. Buy them. The cheap variety are more expensive in the long run than these shirts.
5.0,"My husband wears these under his work shirts and around the house as pajamas. They're soft, comfortable and tag free. Very pleased."
2.0,"Fabrics in general, does not work fine! T-shirt tailoring is also very general. Only worth the price, cost is not high"
1.0,The vnecks are of quality. However it fits like a large or extra large. Definitely not a medium fitting. I am pissed off!
5.0,Love the shirts and they feel great wish they came with shorts or running pants. Also wished they came in more colors
5.0,"I have been searching for these at Macy's for a long time, but they don't have them anymore, this was a surprise, My husband loves these, great fit and great price! Great deal!!!"
5.0,"Fine quality and fit.  Bought them for my husband to go along with pajama pants, and he really finds the material and fit comfortable for sleeping.  Good quality."
5.0,"Size was excellent, the quality was high, very comfortable in confusion.
Calvin Klein brand is well known and I would like to always wear this brand"
5.0,"Calvin Klein undershirts are my husbands go to everyday shirt when he is working. They wash great, hold their color and always fit perfectly. We tried other more expensive brands but he won't wear them because they didn't feel as good and the v-neck was deeper and looked sloppier. Learned my lesson- only buy Calvin Klein."
3.0,"I ordered these as undershirts because I already had white V-neck Calvin Klein shirt that fits very well, and I thought these were the same.  My previously owned short fit nice and snugly across the shoulders as well as through the body.  I wanted the same fit so that the undershirts wouldn't bunch up at the waist under my dress shirts.  These shorts are nice and thin, comfortable and fit like a large across the shoulders, but I think an undershirt should fit tighter through the body than a normal t-shirt.  I must need an ""athletic fit"" undershirt, but am having trouble finding one."
4.0,"These shirts run on the large side. Very soft, comfortable fit. Great for underneath a button up or plain with jeans."
4.0,"the buy was delayed, I usually get the same size, but this I had something big, the model and the quality is all right, it is a pity he did not get the size that i wanted"
2.0,I got 2 of these sets and I really regret it.  They were much longer than expected.  It almost seems a 'tall' size.  Very disappointed that amazon does not clearly state that.
5.0,"I'll be honest, I'm a fashion geek who often buys name brands just because I can feel confident that I look good in them.  There is something about Calvin Klein underwear that just fits and feels great.  I don't know what it is, but I'm a confirmed buyer.  Very reasonably priced, extremely prompt shipment, I would buy from this seller anytime."
5.0,I normally wear snug fitted medium shirts. I have an athletic build. Not jacked. Just..athletic. These fit..casually. I will purchase more.
5.0,"Update:

I'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.

OLDER Revew:
I wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well."
4.0,I just received the skillet because I was away for the holidays.  In about ten minutes I will be checking out its cooking characteristics
4.0,The shoulders are fine but it is too long. So I need resize it. The quality is somewhat cheap. But worth the price.
5.0,"love the fit and feel, and he looked great in these shirts! the size was a perfect fit for my sons frame."
5.0,i love it
4.0,very satisfacyory..g good that when i see tne name calvin klein  i almost get an emotional breakdown have a happy holiday
4.0,"If you're like me, some shirts can make you feel like you're being choked by a really weak guy (thank you Mitch Hedberg). These shirts will eliminate that problem, unless you're really being choked by a weak guy. Quality cotton as opposed to the crap cotton available on all cheap t-shirts (fruit of the loom). These feel good and look good."
5.0,"Very nice quality cotton T-shirt! So far it does not shrink up after drying, I just dry them on a  lower setting."
4.0,"These look good, they fit well, and the material is nicer than other undershirts. Its thinner and doesn't wrinkle and bunch up under a shirt. Also, the V-neck solves one of those manly problems. You don't want to wear a white t-shirt under a black shirt, but wearing a black shirt under a dress shirt usually means Ozzy Osbourne's face is peeking out."
3.0,"Material is very thin for a shirt to look good, and also they are very long...so the sign LG is probably XL.."
5.0,"After receiving the shirts they were a little on the bulky side, however, after two washes they were down to just the right size that I wanted them to be at. The quality is very nice and they are quite soft."
5.0,"Great qualiy and it fit me better except the sheeves is a little bigger, vandeful shopping exparence, so good exparance."
5.0,"They last a long time with quality stitching at the shoulder. Over the years, they keep their form and stiffness unlike other t-shirts that get super thin."
5.0,Calvin Klein infrequently makes their t-shirts available in different colors. I bought these because they are just that. I made the mistake several years ago thinking that they will always offer these shirts in various colors. I was wrong. Get these before they're no longer available.
3.0,The size fits well around the chest and shoulders but the Tshirt is too long. Will need to order the slim fit style next time.
5.0,"I love these V-necks, they are extremely comfortable and will shrink only a minimal amount when washed with cold water."
5.0,"Bought as a gift. My friend liked it, and they seem to look fine when i see him wearing them."
5.0,"These are the best under shirts I've ever owned.  I picked up a pack at Costco a year and half ago and now wished I would have bought a few more packs as they never have them in black.  The medium is a great fit for me as a tall and lean man (6'1"" 155lbs) and, unlike most t-shirts or under shirts, they haven't ""shortened"" on me after constant washing / drying.

Obviously I paid a lot less for these at Costco; about half what amzn is asking for them, but I'm willing to pay the higher price as these are well worth it from a quality stand point.  I wear them as under shirts for dark dress shirts but also wear them as a casual t-shirt as well."
5.0,"The ideal v-neck undershirt for me.  Feels quality, just the right thickness, and my favorite aspect of the shirt is the cut of the v-neck.  It's not too deep nor too shallow; it follows the typical dress shirt neck perfectly with the top button unbuttoned.  No more seeing a gigantic V (like you do with a Hanes v-neck) under a white button-up dress shirt."
4.0,"Shrink a loooot after washing it for the first time, but it fits well The color is the exactly the same as on the picture. I like it."
3.0,The shirts ran big. They did not shrink after washing and drying. My son always wears an XL but XL was way too big.
5.0,These are my go to shirts for everything.  They are wonderfully soft and hold up forever.  Plus they hold their shape through 100's of wash and dry cycles!
5.0,"love them!  i wear the to the gym, to sleep in, to run to the market in.  They always fit and i really like these blue ones.  I normally get white.  Oh and by the way-I'm a 60+ woman and I look really cute in Calvin Klein T-Shirts.  ;-)"
5.0,"I am finally getting the point, want t-shirts that don't shrink after 2 washes, then pay just a little more.  I am used to buying XL shirts counting on the shrink factor.  But was told these would be good as large and they are.  couple washed in so far, no shrinking.  they feel a little different at the front of the shoulder, but nothing I worry about.  I've worn these both as under-shirts and as primary shirt and they look good and work nice for both."
5.0,"I love the Calvin Klein V-Necks undershirts and always wished that they offered colors other than the black, white or gray. Glad I ran across these on amazon.

These shirts are soft and tagless. They fit exactly as expected. Hoorah for color!!"
5.0,Incredibly soft and a perfect fit.  Washed one time and held up nicely.  Didn't get the sense that there was any shrinkage of the fabric - size stayed consistent with pre-wash sizing.  Really good fit and comfortable.  Perfect for jeans of khaki shorts.  Just classic all around.
1.0,"I originally purchased this item from Nordstrom and loved it - it fit like a glove.  It fit so well that I could wear it as an undershirt or just by itself.  I bought this from Amazon thinking it was the exact same product, just $5 cheaper...big mistake.  The Amazon Calvin Klein v necks were poorly cut and very uncomfortable.  It was extremely tight in the chest and shoulders and very long and wide in the torso area, like I was wearing a muumuu.  They immediately felt like factory rejects (or maybe knock off CK's).  I wouldn't recommend purchasing any name brand T-shirts from Amazon."
4.0,"I bought some excellent fresh color shirts to my liking, which received timely, ie what I hoped and expected from this product, I'm happy with this purchase"
4.0,You really cant go wrong these V-neck shirts they fit great and are comfortable. Had no problems washing them at all
5.0,Good buy. Regular fit. Order received as expected. Nice packaging. Good value for money. Would recommend this to others looking for basic white tshirt
5.0,"good quality, and l like it very much, it was so soft.
actually it was better as i expected, good."
4.0,I like and really enjoy it this item. So defiitely I have to buy a new one. It is perfect.
4.0,These T-Shirts fit really good. They are very soft and when washed they did not shrink! Not a bad price either. Would recommend!
5.0,I ordered an XL as a gift but they fit small. So I inherited them. Nice to sleep in! Comfortable.
4.0,CK tees and uw are very comfortable but they are not any more durable. I will continue buying unless better value comes
5.0,this is a t-shirt. a white one. it's great. especaly for when you want to wear a white t-shirt. buy them if that's what you are looking for.
5.0,"I bought these shirts for my boyfriend who had purchased them for himself at another store a few years ago and liked them a lot.  These shirts are light yet durable and the fabric is super soft.  He loves them!  The only difference between these and the old ones he has is that the fabric is a bit thinner now, but it isn't bad quality, just different.  The comfort is what matters most, in my opinion.  They also have a pleasantly flattering fit!"
5.0,"My nephew has used them a lot since I bought them. the fabric is soft, the fit doesn't change with washing and they just look nice"
5.0,"The Calvin Klein t-shirts are cut well, the length is long enough to stay tucked in, and they hold up very well.  Best t-shirts I have ever used."
2.0,"Probably will not buy again because after a few washing they tend to yellow. Cannot use chlorine bleach. I do not like ""dingy"" t-shirts."
4.0,"Very good t-shirt, medium weight cotton but suitable for wearing with or without a shirt that is buttoned or unbuttoned.  Colorfast despite several washings."
5.0,I bought these for my husband. He wears white shirts all the time. I bought these for him. He loves them. They are light and comfortable.
2.0,"Got the 3 shirts, 1 had a weird issue with the neck hole skewing off to the side.
It may have been mis-cut or mis-sewed, but whatever it is it looked bad.

Only 2 of the 3 shirts are worthwhile."
5.0,"These T-shirts are a great value. Have been buying them over the years and find they hold up much better than other brands. And purchased through Amazon, they are a great deal as well."
5.0,"As underwear or not, these are a staple of my wardrobe. A little slim fitting but perfect for my body type."
3.0,"Just fine, decent quality. just nothing to rave about. Jos. A. Bank's are better a bit thicker nicer wearing-last awhile."
5.0,my husband absolutely love these shirts no more wet patch! Highly recommended to all men who wears business shirt on a daily basis.
4.0,"Looks nice.  Shrinks a bit.  I normally wear large size, but on the advice of another review I went with Medium.  Works well.  Have 6 of them now."
4.0,i have been using this since the last six months just amazing the fabric is great soft and good fit
5.0,"good size, good fabric and arrived promptly. it's a slim fit, so it fits perfectly. would buy again fort sure"
4.0,"Calvin Klein makes the best, reasonably affordable undergarments. And the price was right, until I found out how many sales calvinklein.com has!"
5.0,"Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Ao"
5.0,"The packaging is intact and not damaged. The Asian fit to wear the minimum number clothes very personal, it is recommended that you buy!"
5.0,"I have been wearing these for years because I like a light weight T shirt. If you are looking for a heavy T, this one is not for you."
3.0,"These shirts are longer than any other size medium shirts I've ever bought (the sleeves stuck out of my short sleeve shirt sleeves and I do not wear super fitted shirts).  Also, when they came, they were pink.  I looked at them in a lot of different lights, had other people look at them, compared to other shades of white.  It was weird. It went away after the first wash though and now they are a nice brilliant white."
3.0,Same undershirts as at the mall for less money.  The brand I prefer.  Not sure what more needs to be said.
5.0,Great fit and quality as promised in the description.  Neckline fits nicely and length fits deeply into pants so that it doesn't come loose.
2.0,I have ordered a pack of these shirts before and they were exactly what I expected. This time however the material was just a bit thinner than before and the stitching was not quite as sturdy as before. Within the first couple wears of this product the stiching around the sleeve has already torn. The quality is just not the same as previous packs of this shirt that i have owned.
5.0,They were a perfect fit on my boyfriend. Great birthday gift... he loved them;) I would definately buy them again!
5.0,Its so good yes i love it i will prder it again nice to wear it its comftable on time
5.0,"the product that i buy is ok, is original, very good product, and the quality is very good, and im very satisfed with this buy"
5.0,"I have tried all the other brands - Fruit of the loom, Hanes, DKNY etc and the CK shirts are the best quality, period."
2.0,"I purchased these T-shirts for my husband who is 5'10"" and weighs 175.  I bought a ""Medium"" based on the reviews about sizing which stated that they ran large.  These were the right size when I took them out of the package, but shrunk in width so much that my husband couldn't get them over his head.  I wouldn't buy these again because it would be impossible to choose the right size since they only shrunk in width not length."
3.0,"I have been wearing these CK v-necks as my primary white undershirt on weekdays or around-the-house weekend shirt for about 3 years now. Over that time I have probably purchased 6 or 7 packages, some through Amazon and some through other retailers. The first few I had no problem with, but after that, the length varied drastically with each new package I got. The variance between shortest and longest runs about 4 inches. Within a package, they are consistent, but not when comparing those from different packages. This is a problem when using under dress shirts, as the short ones can come untucked very easily and bunch above your pant waistband, or if wearing solo, you get to show off your stomach whenever you raise your hands above eye level. If you get a package and after a wash they seem shorter than they should be, exchange for a different package to try again.

Aside from length, the quality seems pretty consistent, though I've had a few sloppy ""lumpy"" shoulder seams now and again. For the price, you cannot complain too much for this."
2.0,"I`M 200lb,select size L but is too big for me. Maybe I should select size S for me. Amazon`s size guide is not accuracy."
5.0,"I buy these shirts all the time. They feel great under a dress shirt, and fit properly if you have an athletic physique."
5.0,perfect fit! you can tell it was more expensive by the fabric and how it was tailored. came pretty quick. i have already ordered multiple times since the first time i bought a pack!
1.0,Upon opening my order the shirts had an off white look to them. Looking closer they had a slight pink look to them.  I have washed with bleach twice and now they look light pink  To lazzy to deal with hassel of returning  so into the clean rag drawer they go
5.0,"Great quality shirts, they fit snug and are very soft.

I bought it as a stocking stuffer and they can't stop raving about them. They want more more more!

Have washed many times and they seem to hold their ""black"" well."
4.0,"got them right on time, the t shirts are thick enough to be worn by itself, the color is very solid, went just right on the size (medium, im 5'9 175 pounds)"
4.0,"These shirts are definitely good quality, but the sizing is at least one full step (if not maybe a step and a half) larger than normal. I usually wear either a large or extra-large shirt (for comparison, an American Apparel crew t-shirt in a large fits me well but maybe a tad towards the small end of the range.) I bought these in a medium and not only do they fit, they're significantly looser than an American Apparel shirt in large. It seems like CK is doing some vanity sizing in their t-shirt line."
4.0,"I know the description says that these are t-shirts, but really they are undershirts... as in not the t-shirts you just wear on their own.

So to that end, they work well. They are thin, so that you are not wearing bulky layers of clothing. They are extra long, so that they stay tucked in. They are soft and comfy as well.

I'm surprised that others say the shirts run big since I'm 5'5"" and 160 lbs, and I wear a medium... just like my regular shirts.

The only real gripe I have (besides the high price) is that there is a tag on the shoulder that itches me. There's no tag on the neck, presumably to prevent an itchy neck, but then they put the tag on the shoulder. Kinda lame, but no biggie."
4.0,"These seem to be good quality shirts.  The V is just the right depth, and the shirts are well-made with good material.  However, I ordered a Medium, and the size appears to be quite large.  I washed and dried them hoping that they would shrink . . . and they didn't.  If you're debating between two sizes, I suggest ordering the smaller one."
4.0,"I don't get the negative reviews here ... I wear undershirts every day under a dress shirt and this is the best v-neck I have found in awhile.  I find with most v-necks the collars suck - either way too deep and you see an imprint of a deep V under your dress shirt, or they have a thick collar that's too tight.  This is pretty close to just right - just low enough that you can't see it, but not so low that it's WAY under the neck line of your dress shirt (brooks bros iron free, top button left unbuttoned).

Yes the material is thin - I like that, it's an undershirt.  Material is soft and seems to be high quality."
4.0,"it's a little on the thin side but it would serve best as an undershirt, rather than as something that would stand alone!"
3.0,"The shipping was very fast and on time. The price was also very reasonable.. but the quality of the t-shirts was not what I expected. I had to spend at least few minutes cutting the seams of the shirts. Also when I handwashed them for the first time, the black color bleeded alot. It doesn't bleed the second time but it does bleed alot on the first time. Only the quality of cotton is good. It seems very durable and it is actually pretty thick."
2.0,"The quality of these shirts are pretty good. They are soft and seem durable. The only problem I had was that they were way too long. I'm fairly short (5'7""), and the mediums were about 6 inches below my beltline."
2.0,"At ~10 each these are not well made.  The material is thin with long loose strings on most seams and size is too big.  Dockers T-Shirts are a great deal at ~4 each--I only wish they came in black!

Not sure if it matters but mine were made in Haiti."
4.0,"Well made, fit my hat nicely. I'll buy again in other colors."
5.0,"I switch out the band on my Panama Hat depending on what I'm wearing, and how dressy I want to be...black for dressy, colors for more casual.. These are very high quality, and easy to change. The average person never realizes you are wearing the same hat...only having one hatband for your hat makes about as much sense as having only one tie for your suit. And, at this price, you should have several!"
5.0,Fits fine and easy to switch out if you want a different color band.
2.0,"Like most hats, the crown of my hat tapers slightly. When I put the band on, it had a big gap along the top edge. Probably would be great for a stovepipe hat."
5.0,The anchor hook came off the first one before I could get it on my husband's hat! The company immediately sent me another one. The second one went on without a problem. I recommend this company.
4.0,Ok Quality.
5.0,worked great! it was just what i wanted and the color was just right for my hat that i have!
2.0,"This is a nice hat band but we thought we ordered beige, which looked more brown in the picture and it actually is a greenish color."
3.0,"Too tall, but I folded down one pleat and it worked just fine."
5.0,Exactly what we needed to replace another band that came with the hat.
2.0,The band is tight on the hat and tends to pull it together.  I am trying to stretch it some.
5.0,It was a perfect fit for my husband's Tilley's hat .  It looks very nice and stylish.
2.0,"This band did not work at all, it is not tapered. For me it was useless, i guess it may fit other hats."
1.0,"Too small does not fit like it should. In order to get the band to have the same width all the way across the front, the connectors have to mate at the back of the hat and not on the side as is traditional. Not worth the money. And,,,the band is much more green than it is Khaki. Pretty much a failure all around."
4.0,Not fancy but nicely done. Easy to attach. Good deal
5.0,"once i figured out how to put it on the hat' i loved it, I especially liked that it can be used over another hat band if i wanted to.  I don't but nice to have the option."
3.0,"I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly. It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it could use a couple more along the length to make it more correctly fitted to a variety of hats.  I also got this in black, this one isn't quite as long as the black, and the inner end isn't as well put together on this one as the black one was."
2.0,Nothing stretchy here. Had to dismantle it to make it work. Not worth the trouble. Save yourself the trouble and buy a ribbon and stapler. Same look.
5.0,"A nice hatband to dress up my favorite old hat. It dresses the hat up nicely. But pay attention, the attachment pins (actually hooks) are very sharp. In spite of knowing this, I managed to hook the heel of my hand...Dooh! It came in on time and was just as described."
5.0,This was perfect! I didn't like the band on a fedora I bought my husband to wear for our wedding. Took the other off and put this on. Piece of cake! Lookd sharp!
5.0,Met expectations
3.0,Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine. The two pin clip system just did not work for me. snug on the bottom but space on top. the ribbon needed to be designed somewhat concave. I am keeping it because I am going to have it permanently attached by machine.
4.0,Just what it was suppose to be.
4.0,fast shipping and reasonable price.
3.0,Adjustable but it is pleated and can get a bit sloppy looking as pleating can come unfolded.
2.0,"not what I excepted, keeps falling off"
5.0,This fits fine and it looks as good as the original one. I would recommend this to any one that is replacing one with a name on it
3.0,it was just ok. quality was fine but the actual fitting it on the hat is not that easy. it doesnt just fit any hat. would be go to know which exact types beforehand.
4.0,"I like this band. The band gets lots of compliments. Its appealing feature is the pleats.

It is adjustable to any hat size. The hook pin needs some consideration. I pin the hook to the other end of the band and make sure the point is tucked inside the band and not pinned all the way through the band. I make sure it is tight enough it doesn't fall off when flip it onto my head or I set my hat down upside down on the table. The pin is shaped into a hook and I had no trouble with the point as long as it is not strapped too tight around the hat."
1.0,"Don't waste your money on this product.  There are sharp prongs on either end of the band to push into the hat.  Poor quality cotton fabric, the hems are merely ironed over and come loose very easily."
4.0,Was a little difficult trying to figure out how to put it on.  But once we got it on I really liked it.  Looks great on the hat.
3.0,It's o.k.
5.0,"It works.  Fast delivery, no problems fitting it to a hat, especially if you can remove the old band first."
5.0,Great seller! Received earlier than expected very nice quality.  Ordered another.
5.0,Great hat band but I'm going to use it on a new olive green fedora.
1.0,I hate it.  It may fit a small child's hat.
5.0,This style of hat band is perfect for my Panama Jack straw hat.  The old hat band was faded and stained with perspiration.  Thirty seconds was all it took to remove the old band and install the new one.  It looks great now.
4.0,Product is well made and looks good.  Unfortunately not quite what I was looking for.
5.0,It fit as expected
3.0,"I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly. It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it could use a couple more along the length to make it more correctly fitted to a variety of hats."
3.0,Concerned with fit.
1.0,Not ironed properly. Disappointed in condition!
5.0,"Had shorten  one inch From hat band ,Looking good."
3.0,Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine. The two pin clip system just did not work for me. snug on the bottom but space on top. the ribbon needed to be designed somewhat concave. I am keeping it because I am going to have it permanently attached by machine.
5.0,Fits and looks good.
5.0,VERY GOOD
5.0,Look good
5.0,worked perfectly on an old straw head where the band needed replacing.
5.0,Nice pleated band to purchase if you know anything about basic methods of securing the band to any quality made hat.
3.0,It was somewhat large but good quality .
3.0,"The hat was sturdy and of good material.  It was just kind of dorky looking and a little sloppy in fit, so we returned it."
5.0,"I live in Denver and am outside all day in the summer, I have yet to get burnt on my face and neck."
3.0,"The fit is fine but the neck flap is very rigid and thick, Ventilation is pretty good but the flap is very stiff."
4.0,It's a sturdy hat.  I noticed that the adjustment cord hits the flap which can be kind of (irritating) noisy.  Not sure what the hook on the back is for.
5.0,I was able to find buy and receive these socks quickly. They were perfect for our costumes and good quality for a good price.
5.0,"I bought these for a 'sexy' costume I intend to wear this year, and I was not disappointed! The product came brand-new and sealed with no damage to either sock. They're wrinkly from being packaged, but you can easily remedy that by letting them sit out for awhile before use. They breathe very well, and are sheer like pantyhose, so you shouldn't have a problem with wearing footwear. Also, they were cheaper here, and they came pretty fast! I would recommend this product and seller! :)"
4.0,A little flimsy but they are very pretty. I've hesitated to wear them too often because I don't want to have to replace them too soon.
1.0,"Very very cheaply made, not worth it in the least. It came in a tight package and it is hard to unwrinkle the ruffles"
4.0,"They're very durable, cute, and precious looking. I have size 10 feet and was worried these wouldn't fit, but they do ~ The only thing I don't like is that the lace isn't the neatest, like they sew the lace  around the top of the sock and instead of sewing the end and beginning of the lace together, they overlap the lace and then just cut. I put a little bit of clear nail polish over the cut of the lace to stop it from unraveling."
5.0,My socks came very quickly. I like how they feel. I like the ribbon of lace at the top of the sock. They are very comfortable.
4.0,"fabric is a bit synthetic, but i knew it would be. otherwise love these things and wear them all the time. wash easy. comfortable. sessy and fancy."
5.0,Great fun socks to wear with a summer dress.  Adds pizzaz.  Love em.
5.0,Just what I needed for a party
5.0,"Worked perfect for my and my bridesmaid's wedding socks! We wore a second pair of thicker socks over as the nylon was super thin, but they were fantastic!"
5.0,Comfortable and cute.
4.0,Great for a costume
5.0,cute
5.0,Wore these for my 90s themed birthday party! They are very thin so I paired them with another pair of socks underneath.

4.0,"Cheap frilly socks, that fit and got here on time. woo!"
5.0,Very cute & good quality
5.0,I ordered these lace socks for my Dorothy costume - they are perfect!
5.0,"These are perfect for a porcelain doll costume I'm putting together. They add a little touch of girlish femininity to the whole thing. I have pretty small feet (size 5.5), but these fit perfectly and seem like they could stretch to accommodate most sizes. It's kind of a thick pantyhose material, so I'm not sure how long they'll last but they're great for now!"
5.0,sexy and cute all in one and she loves them!!
5.0,"Washed several times, holding up well. I never put in dryer."
5.0,Very nice

5.0,"Good material brought me an unexpected feeling and nice experience. I'll buy again!
I like the pure white socks very much!"
5.0,Super Pretty!!! Like hosiery with ruffles.

5.0,perfect.
4.0,Just socks but seem well made and cute on.
4.0,"Very comfortable, the lace isn't really that frilly though, it's just one layer of a scratchy material that looks like a frill."
5.0,Very frilly
5.0,So Cute. I purchased them to wear at a 1980s party. The feel great and fits perfectly. Can't wait for the party to show them off.
5.0,"Soft nylon socks with lace trim, very comfortable."

BUY THEM!! NAOW!!!"
5.0,"VERY SWEET, A LOT OF FUN."
4.0,"yes, they do look sort of costume-y, but I still think they're cute and they can work with the right outfit. the lace isn't quite perfect but its not very noticeable."
4.0,Quality was good. Socks were perfect for the 50's look. The socks completed my daughters 50's outfit.
5.0,LOVE THESE!
3.0,Works well for my daughters play
5.0,Just right for a theme party
5.0,"Very Nice!!  Gives you that extra little ""sissy"" to your outfit!!"
1.0,"Bought this as a prop for a 90s party, unfortunately i couldn't even use it because it had holes in the seams that caused it to deflate."
4.0,Love these socks! Look just as pictured and great quality. Can't wait to show them off at the 80's party this week-end.
5.0,Very cute... I have large feet size 10... they were stretchy and adorable great price too... fast shipping 
5.0,good quality and very cute.
3.0,I like them OK.  The sheer material for the foot part is a bit uncomforatble.
5.0,Cute n I like them....
5.0,Completed my doll costume!
4.0,My daughter liked these - first part of a Halloween outfit and she continues to wear to school.  They fit perfect.
5.0,perfect
1.0,"Honesty for the price you can't go wrong however you get what you pay for in that, they're cheap and don't really frill out like the picture they also come stuffed in a little package so they were wrinkly and I'm not sure you can iron them without melting the material..I would honestly just save the money. Not really worth it in my opinion.."
5.0,Very cute & sexy
5.0,"very cute for my 50""s costume"
5.0,"Went great with my outfit. Although they are sheer, they did not rip or have a run in them."
5.0,Very nice and so cute.
5.0,Good fit and good quality. Fast shipping also.
5.0,Cute
5.0,"Very comfortable, elegant socks... Thin (comfy) material"
3.0,"I'm conflicted. I wrote a review but feel like I was just a bit too harsh. These would work best with a Halloween costume, not for everyday use with cute outfits. Because, they do look costume-y. But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal. Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection. I would recommend these, just because of the low price. It can't hurt to buy them. They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally. However they did fit me nicely and I wear a size 8 1/2. I feel like they would fit a few sizes larger than me as well."
5.0,"They're so cute, especially if you pull them up a bit to wear with short boots."
5.0,Very cute socks! Fit my size 10 feet perfectly and are even a little longer than I expected having bigger feet! Very cute with any shoes (I love them with these black Mary Janes). So cute!
4.0,Fun little socks despite the price being a little more than I would have hoped for such a simple sock.
4.0,Cute and very comfortable. Needed for a Halloween costume.
5.0,"Cute, cute for my Halloween costume this year."
5.0,Perfect for my Halloween costume!
5.0,Great and cheap
2.0,Cheap rip
5.0,fun socks!
1.0,"These had strings out of the seems on the lace part and lots of manufacturing issues. If you stretch them to fit over your foot it will destroy the sowing and the lace will come apart. The lace that wraps around the ankle isn't hemmed where the fabric ends in the back, so it won't make it through the wash."
5.0,worked well for a retro shoot
5.0,"Super cute,  I used them for a 80's themed party they were a little thin but great"
5.0,:)
2.0,"I needed these socks for a costume and honestly these were pretty chintzy lace trimmed socks.  However, for the price and one time wear, it was fine.  Not sure when or where you would ever wear these and the lace fell apart after a wash.  Would I buy them again?  Most likely not."
3.0,Ran small.  Very thin.  Color from everything transfered to these
3.0,Cheap material. What you'd expect for the price. The lace came frayed and the socks are like a panty hose thin material. They look decent but I doubt they'll last long
5.0,So cute. Would buy more. Very good for the price.
5.0,"HOT, FUN"
3.0,"The material is fine, but not as cute in person as pic l I'm already searching to"
4.0,This is your standard Halloween costume material and durability. Did the job for what it was intended and its adorable.
4.0,These socks are nylon with lace top and they're soft and stretchy.
4.0,cute
5.0,I wear a size 7 and these fit perfectly. The material is more like thick tights so you get a form fit. I think this will fit women's shoe size 4-10 easily. Very Happy.
4.0,Very cute and a good value.
5.0,Gift for granddaughter. She said they fit just right and loves the look.
5.0,Nice
5.0,good
1.0,"Horrible cheap omg , my 7 yr old fits them"
5.0,Super cute socks. Reminds me of my childhood. I wear these with ankle booties.  I love how these look with dresses
5.0,These are perfect with my vintage outfits!
5.0,"Super cute, arrived extremely fast!"
3.0,"I really loved these socks, just wish the packaging came with more for the price!"
4.0,Cute retro socks. Great for swing club.
5.0,Liked them alot
1.0,These were awful no stretch.  I would not recommend unless you have really skinny ankles.
3.0,too big for me (im size 7.5) :/
5.0,So cute
5.0,My wife loved this all because of the lace bit! Fit wonderful and she loves how these feel on her feet!!! Would buy again and again!
4.0,"The frilly part is quite poorly made but when you see them from a distance, they are so cute. And it does look like the picture."
5.0,Using for a Halloween Costume
4.0,I have a size 5 (US) Foot. This sock served its purpose as a Halloween costume- 1 time use. It was a bit large for me. I had a little extra fabric at the heel. I assume this is because I have a somewhat smaller than average foot size. I think if you are a 6 or higher you should be fine.
4.0,Got this for a costume (Dorthy from Wizard of Oz) for my daughter and it looked perfect!
1.0,"Didn't order, must have hit by mistake, had to send it back."
5.0,Super cute and decent quality.
3.0,"I bought these for a Halloween costume and for that purpose, they worked just fine. The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them."
3.0,"The product is just okay for me, it would have been perfect if the whole socks were made of lace"
5.0,"I already had a pair of these that I have owned for over ten years and are still in great shape, and decided to get a couple more to go with some Mary Jane shoes I bought.  They fit nicely, the ruffle is super pretty and holds up after many washings.  Unlike other ruffled ankle socks, the lace stays crisp and the nylon sock does not stretch out of shape and fall down.  I love them!"
3.0,"The socks are cute.  I wore then yesterday but the lace tore as I was putting then on, so not great quality."
3.0,they're ok. the material is just kind of weird. it's kind of like the material stockings from a Halloween store are made from.
4.0,Very cute ankle socks! Fit large shoe sizes very well!! I am a 10W and they fit amazingly! Great buy!!! They are a bit thin though so be careful!
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She's 16 but is into the Lolita style of dressing sometimes.  Anime' and all that stuff.  She loved these socks and my daughter said they were very good quality.  So....I'm glad I bought them for her.  She seems to be enjoying wearing them.
5.0,"Cute socks, and not a bad price for what they are. They were bought to match the Wizard Of Oz."
4.0,"Very cute white socks I only got one pair, very soft and comfortable. I might buy more cause they're so soft."
5.0,Purchased for my teen aged daughter as Christmas stocking stuffer and she loved them.
5.0,"These are also too cute. I had ordered these to go with my daughters costume for Halloween and when I got them, they were just what I had Ordered."
1.0,it was pictured in white...assumed ordered white...ended up with black...no use for them!!! stinks!! disappointed! Going to try return but if the same as the sight where the shoe covers came from...highly doubtful!
4.0,"I got these socks for a Lolita halloween costume and they were perfect for that. No complaints, just a normal sock."
4.0,I really like these socks. I didn't notice that they were nylon and not cotton.  I expect they will run just like hose.  I was planning on something more lasting.  But I do like the funky look with sneekers.
5.0,"My wife absolutely loves these classic lace ruffle anklet socks. Perfect for any schoolgirl outfit. Soft, sexy, comfortable and a reasonable price."
5.0,And all the compliments I get from other women my age who remember wearing them!  Great for wearing with a fun costume.
5.0,"Used it for a show and it went quite well, really glitzy. Only drawback is that the color of my shoe's innersole rubbed off on it, so they got stained but bleached out fine."
2.0,"These socks are poorly made, not comfortable, and would I think work fine for a halloween costume but not much else."
4.0,"Purchased these socks as part of my halloween costume this year.  They are quite thin, but served their purpose!  Great price and free shipping!"
5.0,"Nicely made socks. They look very cute, I get compliments on them all the time.  I still wear them even after the party was over."
4.0,"These were a very cute compliment to a Halloween custom.  They are made from thick stocking material and are opaque, but run a bit large on a size 7 foot.  The lace also has a connection point at the back, but it's not visible.  They are definitely a good find at the price they were listed for."
5.0,These are super cute and very comfortable. The lace isn't cheap looking and the fit is good. Great for pageant queen Halloween costumes!
5.0,"I was looking for this kind of socks to wear on my wedding day! And they are perfect, exactly what i was looking for!. Good quality, comfortable, good price and delivered on time!"
5.0,"I'm a sissy and these pretty socks are unmistakably sissy.  When a ""man"" wears these with heels and a skirt, he is an obvious sissyboy.  That's why I love these so much.  They are feminine and cute and they make any outfit stand out as just a little more adorable."
5.0,"I love this ring, I too was surprised at the thickness of the band......but it doesn't bother me.  Its really pretty and great quality.  I can't wait to add to my amber collection with more!"
5.0,"My 8-year old son chose this ring for my Christmas present.  He got his Dad to help him with the ordering and payment.  When it arrived, I was not allowed to touch the box.  He wrapped it himself and kept it a secret until Christmas Eve. The ring was large and needed some adjustment.  I am thankful that my 20-year old son has strong fingers.  With one squeeze, he had it fitting perfectly.  I love it."

This ring is very well made. It is absolutely stunning and very unique. I've never seen anything like it!"
5.0,I am so pleased with this ring. It is so unique & distinctive and more beautiful than the picture... I ordered the wrong size (too big) and called the company to see if I could get a replacement before I returned the other ring. The owner was fantastic... He immediately shipped me a new ring and I received it the very next day... I give Ian & Valeri 10 stars for service!!
5.0,"I adore this ring, the design is wonderful and the colors are magnificent. The band is fairly heavy, though, and I feel that it is best worn on an exterior finger, and definitely not next to a finger also wearing a ring.  All around a fantastic piece."
5.0,This ring is awesome! I wear the ring on my index finger and it fits great! Comfortable ring.
5.0,A very unusual ring with beautiful earth-colored amber pieces; it is adjustable and fits comfortably despite the fact that the band is somewhat bulky (it doesn't look it though). Combines nicely with most colors and styles due to the neutral tones and simple yet elegant shape.
5.0,"Ian Valeri Co is unmatched in truly unique jewelry design, quality, craftmanship, super price for these top-of-the-line products.  The amber is beautiful and is set in a polished finish. The smaller stones surrounding the larger set off the larger stones and the whole design is beyond UNIQUE.  A very substantial ring not prone to bending or denting. Exceptionally modern design just ""screams"" quality in design.  Love this ring and would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone.  Have purchased other jewelry from seller based on this ring, my first purchase.  ALL HAVE BEEN WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD (OR SILVER)!!  Don't even hesitate...buy this ring and start enjoying it today!  LOVE IT!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful ring, probably even more beautiful than the picture shows, because it glows in the light, and the colors are complementary.  I should comment that it is a heavy ring and that it is rather thick, so it is felt between the fingers.  If you are not used bigger rings, it may take time to adjust to it."
5.0,"If you love amber and unique design, then this is the ring for you.  As some reviewers have said, the band is not tapered and it's big - but the ring is substantial and you really do get used to the round band.  There are 3 different colors of amber - honey, butterscotch and green.  This is a very nice piece of jewelry without the high dollar price tag.  It took 2 days to arrive at my home, so they don't fool around when it comes to delivery of their product. Definitely lives up to 5 stars!!"
5.0,"I've had my eye on this ring for a while.  Finally, last weekend I decided to buy it.  It arrived yesterday, and all I can say is WOW.  It's absolutely gorgeous.  The colors are beautiful and play the light very well (just wait 'til you see it in natural sunlight).  I wear it on my middle finger and it's comfortable.  What a unique piece of jewelry.  Don't hesitate to buy this ring--it's gorgeous and the price is right."
4.0,"As other reviewers have noted, the ring has a rather wide band. Almost like wearing a key ring. Knowing in advance that it was on the wide width side before I bought it, I wasn't suprised and didn't mind the width when it showed up. Arrived in a plain red jewlry box with black foam interior. Nice enough for giving as a gift. The ring itself is very pretty. I think the amber nuggets look a bit plastic but that is the nature of amber especially in small nuggets. Overall I am very satisfied with the ring and will be buying some of the additional pieces the seller who provides this ring also offers on Amazon."
5.0,"I got this ring for Christmas and I love it--and it seems to match almost everything!  It's even lovelier in person and I've gotten tons of complements on it.  The only issue with the ring is that the band is very thick and makes it slightly uncomfortable on my hand.  However, I'm hoping to adjust to the ring soon because it is so pretty."
5.0,"I've been watching this ring for a long time.  When the price dropped I jumped on it.  I'm  happy I did. I specifically bought it to wear on my index or middle finger, I'm glad I did because its a little bulky for me to be wear on the ring finger.  I haven't tried it as a thumb ring, yet.  The day I ordered the ring I got an email saying it had been shipped.  I received the ring the next day!  Bonus!  Great ring and fast delivery."
5.0,"This was my favorite ring. I lost it. I hope some day I will find it but it has been missing for quite a while.
The ring itself is a bit thick, but that's the only negative thing I can think of. The stones are bigger than the rings I normally wear, but not too big. It's not easily adjustable, but I consider that to be a good thing. Rings that adjust easily also wear easily.
It reminded me of planets. It was like wearing planets on my finger.

EDIT 10/27/2012:

I FOUND IT! I FOUND IT! I JUST FOUND IT A FEW MINUTES AGO! I thought I had lost it in a hotel room four years ago but it must have actually fallen off when I was packing away some old baby clothes! It's a little tarnished after being in a box of stuff but it still looks great! :D"
3.0,I bought this ring a year ago. The design is pretty unique and attractive. You won't be wrong with size because the band adjusts easily. I'd love it if the band would be thinner. The thick round band ruins the impression from this ring and makes wearing it uncomfortable. I still wear it occasionally because the ring matches almost any clothes.
2.0,"I read all these great reviews about this ring and it looks good in the photo.  When I received it, well, it looks kind of cheap -- like a toy almost.  I was not really happy with it at all.  It's ok but not like the photo"
4.0,"There's not too much I can add that hasn't been said.  It's a very nice ring.  The band is a bit thicker than ideal, but it's not so thick that you won't want to wear it.  I do find that the smaller stones don't look as prominent in real life as in the pictures online for some reason.  Because of these small issues, it gets 4 instead of 5 stars, although a significant price drop could gain that 5th star back.  I'm glad that I have this ring as part of my jewelry collection.  It's pretty and elegant and unique.  It goes with all different outfits, and people notice it."
4.0,"This is a very unique ring. The colors are beautiful. I would have given it 5 star if it was not too bulky. My fingers are short so it kinda makes it chubbier. I bought this knowing it was bulky or big, but now that I am wearing it, it does look big. Will post a pix so you can judge for yourself before buying it."
5.0,"This ring is as pretty as it appears in the picture and is nicely made.
It takes a little ""elbow grease"" to adjust but it does adjust nicely.

Very happy with order."
5.0,"I ordered this ring for myself as an after tax season reward.  I kept looking at the website and finally ordered it, and boy am I glad I did.  The colors are fabulous and I haven't had a hard time adjusting it.  My only problem - my 21 year old daughter also fell in love with it, so now I may have to order another.  You will not be disappointed in the colors or the design of this gorgeous ring!"
5.0,"I really LOVE this ring!  It is beautiful and unique; a very substantial band, which makes it really cool!  I have gotten tons of compliments on it and enjoy wearing it very much!  I would definately buy it again!!!"
5.0,Beautiful ring. I ordered a 7 and it is too big for left ring finger but fits right ring finger.  Going to order one for my mom.  Very unique.  Also ordered amber ring in 6. Fits left ring finger great.  All the items I ordered met or exceeded my expectations.
5.0,"This ring is beautiful!  I am very happy with it!  I had no difficulty adjusting it--I just squeezed it a little bit, and it first perfectly!  I wear it on my index finger. It is very comfortable."
4.0,This ring is supposed to be adjustable but I needed pliers to make it a little smaller- but that is my only complaint. I've gotten many compliments on it. The stones are beautiful and the same colors as shown in the photo. It also goes with everything.
5.0,"I am so picky about my jewelry, but I can't really afford much. However, when I saw this ring my heart skipped a beat - these are *my colors*!! and what a gorgeous ring for such a reasonable price!
I just got the ring today and I am so pleased with it. I think perhaps the style isn't for everyone but that's a very good thing! I don't want the same jewelry as everyone else ;)"
5.0,"I received this item for Christmas and was very pleased. It is very bold and moderately large, but I do like things like this sometimes. I love having the different types of amber (very pretty). Since it is a bigger ring, I would suggest you get this for an index or middle finger (unless you won't be wearing another ring on the same hand). I'd also not wear it right next to another ring as the silver band could get scratched. Size is pretty true, but the band is mildly adjustable - I was able to open the band a bit with some well-applied pressure (not easy, but possible). If you need to adjust this and are afraid of damage, take yours to a jeweler.

I also have the earrings that match."
5.0,"The ring is pretty much as pictured (I assume amber stones will always vary slightly in color, inclusions, and clarity). As others have remarked, it is substantial (perhaps 8-10 gage), so if your fingers do not taper slightly toward the base, you might be uncomfortable.  The quality and level of finish look excellent to me. I think the price is great for what you're getting--you're probably not going to find something like this at the mall, and certainly not at this price. I love the design because it doesn't look like most other silver pieces you see--a rep from the company told me their pieces are designed and produced in Europe.

But I really want to comment on the customer service--it is exceptional!  I got my ring as a gift and it arrived Christmas Eve. Day. I don't know if it was the ""open"" nature of the ring or just a goof but it was too big for my finger, and the stones were already angled such that their mounts were touching, so I was nervous about adjusting it myself. I called up expecting to leave a message (because you don't exchange through Amazon, and they don't have a formal RMA/tracking process, which made me nervous--basically you return it with a letter explaining why) but not only did someone answer the phone, they also answered some questions and set up the exchange without having received the too-large one back first. I got my replacement ring on the 30th and I am very happy!"
4.0,I wish they were completely lined.  the band around the beret is too rigid. but a great fit for me.
5.0,"I have been wearing berets for 40 years and have owned many, many berets and this is the best of the lot."
4.0,"This beret is very well made with a sturdy flexible cloth band instead of the stiff leather one found in the Basque berets, and it is not as full cut or floppy, which is what I was looking for because I have a thin head that gets lost under a large hat. It is still not as small as I would like, but it is comfortable and stylish."
2.0,"I have this same hat in camel & like it so much I decided to find it it in black. I was delighted to find one on line. It was shipped quickly and packaged carefully, but the hat was a disappointment. I ordered a size M and this clearly was not the same M as the camel hat. Also the inner band (grosgrain ribbon) was so stiff, it was uncomfortable. It didn't seem to be of the same high quality of the other hat I have. I returned the hat. I do want to acknowledge that I was quickly refunded for my return."
3.0,"I had two of these berets and they were my favorite hats. I lost one when the airlines lost my luggage. I ordered a replacement in the same size, but it was too small. For some reason, the sizing is now smaller than a couple of years ago. This was confirmed by both the retailer and the manufacturer. (As I need an extra large and that is the largest size, I'm down to one beret.)"
5.0,I was looking for a beret style hat without all that floppy bulk hanging to one side or the other that many berets have. This is a well-constructed hat that fit those requirements and should last for a long time.
5.0,Well made and stylish as described. My wife was extremely pleased with her purchase.
4.0,"It is really nicely made for the price, however, the sizing is a bit small."
5.0,Great quality. so happy.
4.0,ok
4.0,it was very nice but just sits on my head with no cling. Plus it's very shallow. Not something you can pull down to secure on your head. I measured and ordered the one that was my size but just too big.
5.0,I liked the fit and was comfortable with the fact it wasn't floppy or foppish like some of the others I've tried.  True Hemingway look. :>))
3.0,"Well made and hi quality, but if you're looking for a berat that fits close to your head, this isn't the one. Floppy version that dissappointed me. i kept if but only because the return shipping costs were 1/3 the cost of the hat itself."
5.0,A fineberet indeed.  I put in on right away and its looks on.  I highly recommend this beret it's well made.
5.0,Fit is true and look is classic. Quality is great compared with other budget brands. Rolls up well for stuffing in pocket or coat sleeve and keeps form when unrolled. Really nice hat. Feel like a million bucks in it.
5.0,"I was looking for something a little different, and this fit the bill. It turned out to be just what I had in mind and fits perfectly. Now if they have it in raspberry."
1.0,I wanted cotton handkerchiefs. These are a polyester blend and have more of a polyester than a cotton feel.
3.0,"Softer than Russian toilet paper but not as soft as cotton. They get the job done and if one gets stained beyond use I am not going to lose sleep about throwing one away.

After washing, they are much softer than straight out of the box.

Excellent for nose-blows. Poor for cleaning glasses.

Not the best I have used, but they are, after all, just cheap hankies."
5.0,"I have never had handkerchiefs before so I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  But I wanted to stop wasting so much paper with facial tissues; so I figured I would give it a shot.
When I received these, the seller got them to me faster than expected and I appreciate that, I was a little disappointed.  The seemed so thin.  I could see right through them, even when folded in half.  But they do the job great.  And being thin they easily go into a pocket without being bulky.  I would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a handkerchief for environmental, or any other, reasons."
4.0,"RRSVT DOB1952 review on pkg of 13 handkerchieves.
Packaging is standard to 50 years, ago.
Material is same, with process upgrade predicting greater durability.
AddEdit - many clumps of cloth fiber are on each one, no question of durability with several washes."
5.0,Handkerchiefs are perfect.  Service and shipping the best.  I highly recommend this vendor working through Amazon.
2.0,I ordered what I thought were 100 percent cotton handkerchiefs.  These are NOT--and I'm returning them to the manufacturer!
5.0,"The handkerchiefs are very nice looking & a good size. I didn't realize they weren't 100% cotton, but they seem to be absorbing adequately,"
5.0,THE HANDKERCHIEFS ARE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY MORE OF THEM
4.0,these are very nice handkerchiefs. they wash well and do not need ironing. They are soft enough not to irritate the nose. I can recommend them highly.
5.0,"Unlike cotton handkercheifs, these won't shrink and wrinkle in the wash.  It's nice to know that I can still find permanent press handkercheifs on Amazon.  Fast shipping too!"
5.0,"This chain is beautiful and I was thrilled to find a 22"" length as it is not commonly found in stores.  I plan to use it to hold a charm holder and charms which I haven't been able to wear for some time because I couldn't find the length I wanted."
5.0,This is a beautiful necklace.  My 14-year old wears it with a charm all the time; its very sturdy and a great value for the price.  It goes very well with any type of charm; very very pleased with this piece.
5.0,Good quality and great price. I added a silver charm and it made a great gift. I bookmarked your site so I can order more in the future.

5.0,"This is a beautiful chain. I have bought several of them in different lengths. I would recommend this chain
to anyone. You will not be disappointed."
5.0,Got 5 of these to go along with initial pendents I purchased for my bridesmaids. They were even more beautiful than they were in the picture. I can't wait to give it to them at my October wedding!
4.0,"This chain is pretty, looks nice and arrived on time. I would recommend this chain to everyone, Best as a gift or gesture for that special one. The price is reasonable, and can suit everyone."
5.0,"The chain is beautiful and very shiny.  It goes perfectly with the cross pendant I purchased for him for Valentines day. It doesn't pull on his hair, it is the perfect length and is stands out nicely with his work clothes.  I would reccommend this product to anyone!"
5.0,"I was pleased with the quality of the chain, however based on the picture I thought it would be slightly thicker. All in all a very good buy."
5.0,I bought two chains. One for my mother and mother in law to hold birthstone pendants I had purchased for them for mother's day. The chains are beautiful and go great with the pendants I chose. They came very quickly. So quickly in fact that I may just buy another one for my grandmother for mother's day.
5.0,"There are somethings that I just wouldn't ordinarily order on-line and jewelery is one of them.  I took a chance and ordered the Italian Box Link Chain Necklace, and I was blown away by the quality of the Sterling Silver chain that I received.  I looked around at several jewelers and for the money, you can't beat the price that this seller is offering, not to mention the fact that the item arrived way before I expected it in perfect condition!  I will buy from this seller again due to the quality of the necklace and the service."
5.0,"I have been looking all over for silver necklace chains and could not find anything that would good enough.  So I decided to explore on Amazon and came across these.  As soon as I saw these and read the reviews from other customers, I knew they would be perfect!!  I just bought the charm part (a break in half big sis lil sis) of a necklace for my little sister who turns 12 next month so I was in need of getting necklace chains.  I received them in the expected arrival due date, in perfect condition!  I would GREATLY recommend this chain to any other individual who is looking to purchase a chain.  I could not ask for anything better!  Thank you!!"
5.0,This is a beautiful chain especially for the price.  I liked that I could order just the length I wanted and the service was first rate.  I will be buying from this company again!
5.0,"For what I paid this is a high quality chain for a great deal. It's important to me to have chains with different widths/lengths to choose from for my many pendants. This chain is sturdy, shiny and cleans easily (a plus for silver). Would definitely buy again :)"
5.0,"this is a beautiful box chain, bought it to go with a pendant I bought for my wife for our 40th wedding anniversary It looks perfect with pendant... Great product"
5.0,I received that product as stated in the description within four days. The chain itself is very sturdy and looks fantastic. It was perfect for hanging a charm I had purchased for a friend. The clasp is strong and I would definitely recommend buying from Gem Avenue. I would make this purchase again.
5.0,"I have lived in Italy for 3 years, and let me tell you I know the quality of real Italian jewelery. When I received this chain, It was the same quality as in San Marino, 8 years ago. My wife is very happy.

AAA+ Product

Thank you!"
3.0,"I was astonished to find a sterling silver chain for such a low price.  Maybe it was just the chain I ordered, but the clasp broke after less than two months of gentle use.  It looks good, lays well and you can't beat the price, but now the next box chain I buy will be at cost plus the price of this one.  Not fixable.

UPDATE 2/15/2011:  The second chain we ordered from this company also broke with no force.  It's a nice chain, but we're moving on to a new brand."
5.0,"This chain was very nice, delicated, yet strong. I Used it to hold a large pendent.  I like the look of the box link, and it is comfortable, not getting my hair caught in it."
5.0,"These guys are great!! Last min. I had to contact the seller to change the size of my girlfriends necklace, and they did it so quickly. The response time was great.  Fast shipping!!! Came in a nice little box and my girlfriend love the necklace!! It looked so great on the charm that I got her!! She liked it alot and said that for the price we should get 3 or 4 next time!  It does not get tangled in her hair like the last necklace she had!! It looks great and it was nice and small!! Perfect for her nice charm!! This is a nice quality product and great shipping from the seller!! Thanks!! Grade A++++++++"
5.0,"Ordered a 20"" and 22"".  Very nice quality, will order again.  Would definitely recommend"
5.0,"This is a great product.  I have never before seen chains of this quality for such low prices!  And even though the prices are low, the product is not cheap quality.  The chain is very pretty and durable.  I've had mine for a while now and I've not seen any visible wear or tarnish on it.  I exchange the chain between several different pendants and it works and looks great!  Highly recommend this product."
5.0,"I'm not sure what people are expecting when you pay less than $10 for a chain, but what I received were some delicate, beautiful chains meant to be worn for occasions with a pendant, not everyday rough use. Thanks for the timely shipping and nice product."
5.0,the chains i received are very beautiful.  They came in separte packages.  Shipping was quick.
5.0,"I bought this necklace to go with a pendant I already had and I couldn't be happier with it!! I assumed because the price was so low that it would probably not be what I was looking for but I was pleasantly suprised when I opened the package! It is a beautiful chain and feels sturdy enough that I don't worry when I wear it to bed or to the gym! Anyone looking for a simple, sturdy chain should check this out!!"
5.0,I love this necklace.  I needed a replacement chain for my favorite necklace and this has been perfect.  It's beautifual and I've gotten several compliments on it!
5.0,"I absolutely love this chain, and am extremely pleased with it. I also am pleased with the very fast and excellent service I received. I intend to buy more of these chains, for some pendants I have. They are an excellent buy!!"
5.0,"I needed a nice, inexpensive chain for a charm I received. This chain was beautiful and very sturdy. I was very pleased with every aspect of the chain."
5.0,"The chains were for my grand daughters, so I'm very picky about the quality.  They don't contain the harmful chemicals that are found in the extremely cheap chains, so I know their health will not be put in jeopardy.  The quality of these chains is excellent!  They are strong and very beautiful!  My grand daughters had some charms they wanted to wear and these chains are perfect! I will definitely purchase these chains again when needed!"
5.0,"I bought this chain for my 24 year old daugther.  We BOTH loved it...although it appears to be delicate, it's well made and will support any pendant my daughter chooses to display on it.  The size of the chain is perfect.  Thank you so much!

A pleased customer!"
5.0,"I love this chain!  It's a super value and a very strong, good quality piece. I ordered one to replace a flimsy chain for a necklace/charm and loved it so much that I ordered another for myself and one for my mother.  There was a small problem with one clasp but the seller handled the return easily and swiftly.  I'll definitely purchase more of these box chains."
5.0,I was very satisfied with this product and with the vendor.  I received just what I ordered and I received it in a very timely manner; much faster than I had anticipated.
5.0,My husband bought this chain for me.  It's lovely - and just the right size to add small charms.  I have bought several items from Gem Avenue and my experience has been great.  They sell quality merchandise and what you see is exactly what you get.
2.0,"it seems like it's not the right size, and it's very delicate..i hope it doesn't break when my sister in law uses it, if it does, i will be letting you know."
5.0,this was excellent. i purchased this chain for a pendent (also purchased from this seller) and it looked great. this made a great gift and my girlfriend loved it!
5.0,Chain is beautiful in person.  The picture does not give it justice.  All good experiences with this seller!
5.0,"I ordered this necklace for my mom for christmas and I was so surprised at how nice and shiny it was and just the overall quality of the necklace.  She has had issues with other necklaces breaking and this necklace she absolutely loves, it's very durable.  I would definitely recommend to anyone it's more beautiful than in the pics."
5.0,"I received a lovely necklace for Christmas, but wanted a slightly longer chain.  I was able to get a perfect match for the original chain in the length I needed.  It is beautiful, great quality.  It shines so beautifully.  I'm considering ordering another chain from this company just because they are so lovely."
5.0,"My daughter just loves this necklace I got her.  Strong and durable.  To bad I'm not a better sizer, almost to tight for her neck."
5.0,"These chains are lovely and an excellent value.  I bought them to replace the base metal chain that come with a religious medal.  It is a nice, strong chain.  Thanks!"

5.0,"I purchased one of these to go with a charm as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I ordered it rather late, but it arrived on time and she loves it.  It's good quality and I will most likely purchase one for myself sometime soon."
5.0,"Looking to pick up replacement chain for my wife. Surprised by how cheap the price was....didn't know what to expect. Chain arrived and was perfect, much better quality than what was being replaced, and the clasp (which broke on the one being replaced) was high quality and easy to use. Extremely satisfied."
5.0,"I purchased this item for my daughter to wear with a charm picture of her son.  The chain makes the look.  It is of great quality and really makes the whole look expensive and well done.

5.0,"i bought this necklace for my 6 year old daughter. it was her first necklace so i wanted something that would be durable for a very active little girl. She absolutely LOVES it!!! It holds up to sleeping in it AND playing with it on. She has 2 brothers and believe me they play hard, rolling around on the floor inside and the grass outside, jumping on the trampoline and all. We have had for a little bit now and it does not have a crinkle in it. Still looks as good as the day we bought it, and still shiny! I definitely recommend this necklace for anyone that is active and needs something to withstand day to day activities."
5.0,"I ordered this chain to specifically use with a very beautiful sterling silver cross.  I was very pleased when I received it as it matched so closely with the cross you would swear it came with it.  It is made very well, the clasp is responsive and easy to open and close.  I am extremely happy with it and recommend it highly.  It can be worn alone, with other chains or, as I have done, worn with a very special cross, religious medal or other sterling silver pendants."
5.0,I haven't honestly gave it as a gift yet but it seems to be a great item. I bought it for my wife for Christmas. I am hoping that it all goes well.
5.0,I bought two of these chains and couldn't be more pleased.  They are beautiful in quality and they were shipped delicately and quickly.  This amazon seller is outstanding.  A pleasure to do business with.  I would recommend to anyone needing to make a jewelry purchase to do so with this seller.
5.0,I bought this necklace for myslef because it is bright and it is noticed all the time.  It is durable as well.  It can hold some weight as well.  It stays bright.  Just the right length as well.  There is nothing negative that comes to mind about this necklace.  I will end up ordering more of these because I do need two more.
5.0,"A very nice chain at a nice price too.  Bought for my daughter to put charm on; if she needs another, this is where I'll buy!"

5.0,"I've purchased 3 of 24"" Sterling Silver Necklace chains now from Gem Avenue. In each case I was replacing a much smaller chain. They are all high quality, in perfect condition and look wonderful. As a bonus, Gem Avenue was a pleaseure to buy fromas I received my product far quicker than they estimated."
5.0,"Very nice chain, very shiny and a VERY good price. I don't think you'll be dissapointed."
5.0,"I was very Pleased with the necklace. Of course so much better looking than the photo can show. But it does a pretty good job of showing how pretty it is. Truly love the silver box that comes with. Makes it so nice & easy when gift giving, as I usually do. I will most certainly be purchasing more items. Thank you for your quality items. Robin Griffin."
5.0,"I bought these to put pendents on for my children as part of our wedding ceremony. They are perfect weight and complimented the pendent perfectly. I bought 3 of these and they arrived quickly. Procrastination can be a downfall when ordering online. These came in just a few days. The silver boxes made it easy for me to ""marry"" the pendents with the chains and then put them back into the boxes to be presented on our wedding day.
Thank you"
5.0,"I DIDN'T BUY THE CHAIN FOR MYSELF. I'M GIVING IT TO SOMEONE FOR CHRISTMAS WITH A
CHARM TO MAKE A PENDANT. SILVER CHAINS ARE EXPENSIVE AND I HAD ALREADY DONE MOST OF
MY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING FOR THIS PERSON ALL I WAS LACKING WAS A CHAIN. I SHOPPED ONLINE AND IT LOOKED LIKE I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET HER A CHAIN TOO EXPENSIVE SO I FOUND THIS ONE AND BOUGHT IT. THANKS"
5.0,"Gem Avenue was very prompt in their shipment and the price for the jewelry was very reasonable. The piece is what you would want, beautiful, but sturdy. I have confidence in Gem Avenue and would certainly shop there again, especially for large colored CZ jewelry, which I really enjoy. Everything from Gem Avenue has been gorgeous!"
5.0,"The only thing I can say I'd prefer different is a lobster clasp as this one is small and hard to put on with nails. But it is hands down the best price on a sterling silver quality chain and I will return to this seller for more items :) I cannot wear gold or platinum, as it turns my skin black on contact-so since I like quality, great silver and awesome buys always make me a very hapopy girl :) I recieved this as a gift and was very pleased :)"
5.0,After buying this necklace I tried this on myself and found the ease it has of sliding it on and off when I need to do so. This necklace well designed and has real class. I highly recommend this to anyone in need of a necklace.
5.0,"I bought this chain to go along with a necklace that I purchased, and I think it accented it quite nicely. It wasn't too thick, or too thin. It seemed very durable, and it being made of sterling silver will ensure it doesn't leave any weird discoloration.

Aside from all of that, it's CHEAP. I'm getting ready to buy another one pretty soon."
5.0,The picture does not show how pretty and delicate the necklace is. It looks very expensive. You can't find anything this nice for such a reasonable price in a store. LOVE IT!!
5.0,"The chain came just as described in a cute little silver box :) It's in excellent condition and I can tell that it's high quality! Definitely worth it for the price! I got the 16'but, I wish I would have gotten the 18' so it could be a bit longer. The 16' is too short for my style but still high quality!"
4.0,This chain is just as beautiful as the description says it was! I would definitely shop at this merchant again!
5.0,I was extremely pleased with the sterling silver chain I purchased.  It was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you.

5.0,This necklace was perfect for the charm i bought for my girlfriend. It was the perfect size. thanks
5.0,"First, I want to say I was shocked when this chain arrived so quickly. I even rechecked my orders on Amazon. This is a gorgeous chain. It is femine but very strong. The shine is great but not cheap looking. It is a very good looking and sturdy chain. I was going to make a necklace to sell out of it but have it on right now without any kind of pendant on it. You don't need a pendant on it for it to look beautiful. Best investment and I am going now to order some more in different lengths."
5.0,"I haven't worn necklaces in years, and I bought a pendant at a flea market which needed a chain.  The one I bought with the pendant broke within a week.  I am an amazon junkie so naturally that's where I went to find a new one.  I came across this chain and ordered one.  It arrived early (the vendor graciously took it upon themselves to ship it priority mail at no extra charge) and it was perfect.  I had 2 other pendants that I've been waiting to wear but haven't so I went back and ordered 2 more chains.  I would highly recommend this seller and product to anyone in search of a well-priced quality necklace."
5.0,"I purchased the 30"" chain -- it's very pretty and delicate, and a good value for the price."

4.0,"I have baught my last 2-3 chains from Gem, all are steardy, can handle my heavist pendents,The chain that you by from gem are on of the best. How ever I did brake on in half when cleaning it. So be careful if you need to shine it up a bit. One major thing I do like is it's not coated with anti tarnish solution, which I allergic to."
5.0,"Awesome! I wanted super bright 18'' silver chain, as I own darker one, and it didn't match my new charms. It's gorgeous, arrived fast in cute little box. LOVE IT! I also ordered 14'' and it was about 13 3/4"", but it still ok for me."

5.0,"I have made many purchases from Gem Avenue over the past several years.  I purchased this silver chain in 2 different lengths and love them.  I have also purchased pendants, earrings etc. from them in the past.  I have always recieved my purchases quickly and without any hassle and have always been very happy with all of my purchases."

5.0,I purchased these for my two small granddaughters to put a small silver cross on.  They will be given to them in April on their birthdays.  They are very pretty.
5.0,"most chains are going to eventually break. ive paid a lot for some and they always break, if this last 6 months it will be worth it and it looks like it will last a lot longer."
5.0,It was exactly what I was looking for. Very beautiful chain. I was very pleased with the quality and the value.
5.0,Item was great quality and came promptly.  I'm very happy with it and recommend it unreservedly.

One chain was for me and one was a gift. The recipient loved the gift as did I. I will order more jewelry from this great company."
5.0,"I got this chain in the 30"" length along with several pendants from Gem Ave.  I love this chain, it looks nice and is really tough.  I am kind of hard on chains and was worried about buying one online without seeing it.  I could not be happier and the price is great."
5.0,"I bought three of these chains for my daughters.  They really look nice, the metal has a nice shimmer to it and I am very pleased with the sturdiness of the clasp.

These are a great value and I highly recommend them."
5.0,"My daughter passed away awhile back,and the only thing I have of her's is a dolphin pendent. I bought this chain for it. It added alot of beauty to my memories of giving her that dolphin. I will order jewelry!"
5.0,"Every once in a while, you find finely crafted silver-work at a ridiculously low price and Gem Avenue is one of those rare finds.  I've bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case.  The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no ""play"" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels ""expensive"" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door).  The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no ""hanging"".

  I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th"" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time.  I know, I swallowed my tongue, too.  But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom.  Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business.  We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that.  Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don't quite ""seat"" properly or fail altogether.  Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn.  These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show.  And to beat it all, they're pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry.  Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased.  Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains?  Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we'd see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking.  When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and ""through the grapevine.

You will be quite happily surprised with what you buy here. Always a fine experience.

Very Best Regards,

5.0,"Beautiful chain, sturdy, shiny, elegant.
I love Gem Avenue and their products, I will definately continue to buy from them!"
5.0,"I ordered two of the 18"" silver box chains.  First, they arrived in record time (I ordered from Gem Avenue) and each were packaged securely and boxed separately. The chains are exactly what I was hoping to receive.  They are sturdy without looking cheap (and actuallly look very expensive).  They hang nicely and the clasp looks well made.  I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the ""box"" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it's the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I'm very pleased with both the quality and the price.  I tried to get the same kind of chain at our local department store and it was twice as much.  You won't be disappointed!"

I will be using this seller again and recommend them to anyone looking for good quality jewlery and great service."

I got the 30"" and it fits perfectly. Beautiful indeed, I highly recommend such an excellent deal on very fine silver."
1.0,"I just got this chain last week. I wore it. The next day, I took a shower with it on, and the silver color just faded. The chain is an ugly blackish brown now. Such poor quality. I wish I knew this, I would have never ordered. My money went down the drain.

I am surprised no other customers had had such an experience.

Returning this crappy chain is out of question since I would hate to pay for the postage."

exceptional. And the fact that it is available in at least 7 lengths is
rare."
5.0,This is a lovely necklace. I especially like that the seller offers it in different sizes.
5.0,"I needed the right silver chain for a pendant that I'd purchased my mother for Christmas. To be honest I didn't expect much, and felt like I was taking a chance by ordering it from a vendor on Amazon. Much to my surprise I was completely wrong. This chain shipped very quickly, was packaged really nicely, and was in excellent condition. It actually added a sparkle to the pendant instead of the other way around, and the length was exactly what I'd requested. I'll definately do business with this seller again."

5.0,"Lovely chains,good price,tracking info provided timely, and very fast delivery. Very pleased with my shopping experience and will definitely purchase from this seller again.

I purchased these chains (20 and 22 inch) to hold religious medals which involved travel to the Vatican to have them personally blessed by Pope Benedict so the medals are close to irreplaceable.

I am impressed that though the chains have just the right appearance of style and delicacy, they are very strong (I rarely take them off and have slept, played tennis, and gone swimming with them on).

I recommend these chains and plan to purchase several more."
5.0,I have ordered quite a few of these chains already and probably will order more...they're perfect!
5.0,"It is a very nice and sturdy chain, the clasp is big enough to open/close with no difficulty. Looks good, very bright and shiny."
5.0,"This is just what I was looking for.  So many silver chains are overpriced.  This is slender, beautiful, and perfect for adding whatever charm, locket, or decoration you would like to create.  It ships quickly and would be perfect for Christmas presents!  I love the fact that it's available in a number of lengths!"
4.0,They give internet shopping a good name.  The delivery was fast and the necklace was prettier than I imagines it would be. Thank you! Thank you!

I bought this chain to wear with different pendants that I have.  It is strong, wears well, and is a great addition to my everyday jewelry.  This chain would be a great gift for any lady, young or old.  I definitly will buy many more."
5.0,"I was looking for a replacement silver chain for a pendant I own.  This is just the right length and weight, and so far, no complaints on durability or snagging on clothing.  I plan to order 2 more in other lengths - at these prices, you cannot miss!"
5.0,"I have purchased several sterling silver Italian box link chains from Gem Avenue. They are beautiful chains for an extremely reasonable price. It is thin enough to be comfortable, but thick enough not to break. No complaints, highly recommended! Would definitely do business with this company again! Thank You!"
4.0,"This chain is great for pendants, but as someone who rarely takes of the chair, I would say: Be wary of durability, My chain gets caught on things, and the first one snapped, just be warned, the clasp can break, but at the price, its cheaper to buy a replacement every once and a while than find something more durable (and a lot more expensive)."
5.0,"I never take my jewelry off, I wash with it, and play with it...I have broken so many chains it's not funny. Most necklaces and bracelets come with chains that if you sneeze wrong it's broken and the clasps are a joke most of the time. Another reason why I stick with sterling silver now.

This chain so far looks like it will go the distance, and if it lasts a year with me then you can be sure it is quality! I will let you know. SO far it's been a month which is still pretty good for most chains."
5.0,"I bought this chain to go with a pendant I got from another jewler. The pendany was expensive, the chain was not but they go together beautifully."
5.0,"Since it was Gem Avenue, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  I have many pendants and this one will show them off!  The links and clasp are great for me.  The chain itself is beautiful - I have another one for either a gift to give or to wear alone."
5.0,"I needed a 22"" chain, so I bought this one and another one.  This one was by far my favorite of the two!  It is just what I wanted: delicate without being fragile, and not overly shiny."
5.0,"I bought this cause the pendant I bought came with an 18"" inch chain which I thought was a bit small for my neck.  I bought this in 24"" and it is the perfect size and great looking."
5.0,This is a great purchase for anyone needing chains for pendants or charms or just to have on hand for backups.  A good price and whichever size you need - saves a lot of time looking for the right length.  Well recommended.
5.0,"great customer service, very informative, chain actually more beautiful in person than pictured! bought as a quick replacement to a Tiffany's chain that had become tarnished, just as beautiful."
4.0,"This necklace definately looks like a quality product.  Its been lasting so far and seems sturdy enough to go the distance.  The clasp seems strong even when it got caught on something and got tugged on a bit, it held up and didn't break.  Overall the delivery was kinda slow but not terrible plus the product was worth the wait.  Beautiful chain - looks good with a pendant. (good comments courtesy of my brothers gf which it was a gift for)"
5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for, good quality at a great price. Shipping was fast and the item was nicely packaged.
I would definately order again."
5.0,The chain is very good quality. I like that it comes in a little gift box and in a little clear bag to protect the chain. And it's the perfect length.
5.0,"This silver chain is a surprising value. It is well-made, good quality, and very elegant on your neck."
5.0,"I recently ordered and received a 30"" 1 mm Italian Box Link chain from Gem Avenue.  I was very pleased about three things:  #1)The customer service was great.  #2)The box chain advertised was exactly as described -excellent quality, beautiful. 3)The price of such a nice quality chain was just too good to be true!  My overall experience with both Gem Avenue and the product sold to me was pleasing and excellent, and I definitely would order from them again in the future!"

5.0,"I am one of those people who have an almost nonexistent neck, and the standard 18"" chain doesn't work under any circumstances. Trying to get a necklace or a pendant chain at 24""-30"" is nearly impossible unless you are willing to pay through the nose to get it! This is just right! I got the 30"" box chain. It is sturdy, nice looking, very strong, and perfect for the pendant enhancer I got for Christmas (sans chain). You won't be disappointed with this purchase. There are so many lengths available that you can't go wrong. VERY GOOD QUALITY ALSO!!!!"
5.0,"This chain is very nice, strong and very servicable for most pendants.  I needed a shorter one to wear with open necked tops and it does the job.  I have many pendants but all my chains are long. Thank you."
5.0,"These are excellent chains. My wife has a tendency to break delicate looking chains within a day or two, but she is still wearing these after several weeks. These are very good quality for the money, not cheap junk that turns green after a few days of use. My wife's chains are still as shiny and beautiful as the day she put them on for the first time. Unlike some of the other ""sterling silver"" she has bought in the past, these chains are the real thing."
5.0,"I purchased this necklace for my wife for Christmas or 2007. Not only did it arrive on time for Christmas, the packaging was very stout. Just from seeing the box and the packing material I had no doubt that the necklace had arrived in tack.

My wife loves the necklace! Plain and Simple. She says that it is great because it is interchangeable with a number of pendants that she has or it looks elegant by itself. I hit a home run with this great little stocking stuffer! You cannot go wrong with one of these necklaces!"
5.0,"I ordered the 30"" chain--what a great price and beautiful product!
I love it."

Thrilled Customer :)"
5.0,"It was about six days before Christmas and I was searching all the local malls trying to find a chain to go with the ""O"" pendant that my dad had gotten to give my mom for a Christmas gift.  I could not find the chain I was looking for.  Finally, I decided to look on Amazon and at first didn't see anything I was interested in.  I went back and looked on Amazon again the next day and saw a thin box chain, but I didn't know what a box chain looked like and the pictures only showed but so much.  So, I decided to wait.  The next day, I went to work and one of my co-workers was wearing an ""O"" pendant on a thin box chain like the one I saw online.  So, I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain.  I was so worried I wasn't going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas.  Finally, when I almost gave up, out of all the box chains and sellers on Amazon, there was only one seller, Gemavenue, who's last acceptable order date for the holidays was still within the time limits.  So, I bought their box chain and it was perfect because I was able to choose the length I needed and it was thin but sturdy, like I had been looking for.  I asked for express shipping and ordered it on a Thursday and Christmas was on Tuesday.  The chain arrived that Saturday.  I was so thrilled when it arrived.  It was the right length and had a pretty shine to it.  My mom opened it on Christmas morning along with the pendant and was so surprised.  She loved it.  It was perfect!"

5.0,I love this sterling silver chain!  We bought it for our 10 y.o. daughter and finding a 16-inch chain was key.  The chain came in many other lenghts too.

5.0,It was so great to be able to find such a great quality chain on-line.  It was a gift and was adored.  I would definately recommend it to others.
5.0,The chain was lovely and has a very good clasp on it. Was very pleased with the quality.

5.0,"I bought this item to give as a gift to my sister for Christmas.  I had purchased a very unusual pendant but couldn't find the ""perfect"" chain until I found this one.

Thanks for such a great product with PROMPT and courteous service attached!"
5.0,"This is a great little chain. I bought 3. 2 for my daughters and one for me, unfortunately I gave one to my sister now I have to order another one. :)I got the 18 inch length which worked out perfect for the pendants I put on them. Lovely chain."

5.0,it is a nice necklace that'll go well with most pendants. Great as a gift!
4.0,"It's a pretty basic box link chain.  My girlfriend is pretty rough on jewelry and it hasn't broken yet, so it must be durable enough.  Nothing special to it, but if you are looking to hold a charm, this works fine."
4.0,I purchased this with two other items for my mom.  The chain was in excellent condition and I truly am pleased with it.
5.0,"My young nieces will love these. I do.  I purchased two of these chains because they are shorter than the ones on the pendants I bought for my young nieces.  I had no idea that they would be so very beautiful and sturdy, much better than the ones that came with the pendants.  They literally glitter.  And. . .,the box chains are so strong that I suspect three and five-year olds will be unable to easily break them. How can they be so reasonably priced?. . .Real sterling priced like cheap silvertone! Oh. . ., and they also arrived in record time."
5.0,I was very pleased with the chain that I received. I loved how it would sparkle as it moved on the skin. Very nice.
5.0,"I had been searching for a silver box chain that was long enough for my husband to wear.  This one was perfect for his cross pendent.  You can't beat the price, and the shipping was fast also.  Great buy, I would recommend this seller."
5.0,"I purchased the Necklace as a Christmas gift for my mother. She's been wearing her favorite charm on a rusty piece of chain for several months because she can't afford anything nice. When the package arrived, my son exclaimed, ""Wow, that's beautiful. Granny is going to love it!"" I can't wait till Christmas to see the expression on her face when she opens it. Thank you for having such a beautiful and affordable product."
5.0,"Even though I got this chain as a replacement for a rather ""basic"" chain for a pendant, I think it would be great by itself.

I like that it came in a box, too. Some chains I have ordered from other places have just given me a pouch, or even a plastic zip-loc bag.

Definite quality here, I fully recommend it."
5.0,The necklace is beautiful! It is very sturdy and exceeded my expectations! You CANNOT find a quality necklace like this anwhere for the price! A must buy!
5.0,"Silver Box link chain.  I bought this chain at first for the length. 22"". Most chains only come in 24"" or shorter.  This was a very good buy on my part because the chain is really attractive and sturdy enough to hold the pendant that I wanted it for.  In fact, the pendant looks even better now with this attractive chain. I should have bought more. The price was so reasonable. I am going to order a few more to have on hand. For myself or a gift item.  Very pleased. Quick shipping too!!  Thankyou, Linda from New Jersey"
5.0,"I bought several of these in various lengths for gift pendants and every one was a winner. The silver is bright and shiny, the link is sturdy but looks just right for a pendant. The ring clasp seems strong and every one worked smoothly. These were shipped superfast and well packaged. I checked prices in my local ""big box"" store and these are better chains at a lower price even with shipping.  I am definitely a happy customer."
5.0,This necklace is delicate looking without being so thin that it will easily break. It's lovely.
5.0,I purchased this as a gift and was a little worried what it might look like... I was really surprised at the quality.  The picture does not really show the quality or the detail. The finish was excellent. Would highly recommend this chain. Gem Avenue was great to deal with. Very prompt shipping.
5.0,The product is of great value.  The product more than met my expectations.  This company is very reliable and shipped when promised.
5.0,"The chain I ordered was sent promply. It was great! The chain is on me 24/7 since it holds an Italian luck horn I wear. The chain looks great, and it has a good clasp. Perfect for holding my charm since I did not want to invest in white gold."
5.0,"I had been looking for this type of necklace for a few months now. With a store that I won't name, I had to send back a necklace I bought 3 times because they couldn't get it right. I began searching for a necklace like this but could not find it. Finally, I found this necklace on Amazon and ordered it. It came way sooner than I expected (which is always a good thing) and felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I opened the package and liked what I saw. I wear it everywhere I go and I am glad that I bought this necklace. I would definitely recommend buying this necklace."
5.0,"The Sterling Silver Curb Cuban Link 4mm Italian 18"" neckless is very attractive and well made.  I will definitely order more from Gem.  Service was great and the product was received when promised and in good condition.  Definitely a five star company."
5.0,"Beautiful and highly shinny necklace; prompt delivery: took only 4 days to receive merchandise through standard shipping. A little desappointed with the package it came in. For a piece of silver jewelry, I would expect a little more sophisticated case."""
5.0,"I bought two of these for my husband and I, and we love them.  We never take them off!  Thank you so much"
5.0,This item is very nice i ordered the 30 Inch and it came out just as i expected and it is new and shiny.
5.0,We purchased the Chain for our son for Christmas.  It was a hit with him!  He hasn't taken it off since Christmas morning.  The chain is very well made and looks great.
5.0,"the chain this perfect one, envio was perfect and is but of wich it hopes!!!"
5.0,"They tend to come out pretty easy, as do most of the screw in type, just carry extras to replace if needed."
4.0,"I use shoes with these cleats in a very slippery stream and in the stream they work great. My problem has been getting to the river. Some of the paths are muddy and the old spiked studs seemed to work better in the mud. I've slipped in the mud a couple times using these cleats. In the stream, they work better than anything I've ever tried."
5.0,This is an excellent product.  Very comfortable and good quality.  Size described correct on advertising.  Good company to order from.
4.0,"I have worn this type of product for many years, as it makes sweaters fit and look better for those of us who have small or sloping shoulders.  It has been very hard to find these in lingerie depts, and I was very happy to find it on-line.  The product came in a timely manner, was just what I ordered at a good price."
4.0,Love the material and cut of the camisole.  Shoulder pads need to be thicker.  I will be adding additional shoulder pads to the camisole.
5.0,Nice quality and fits well.
3.0,Fabric is a little cheesy but the price is right.
4.0,Edge of neckline a little too close to my neck; I have to adjust frequently so it isn't showing under my sweater's neckline.
5.0,"My mother still loves wearing shoulder pads, so this camisole makes her very happy. It washes and dries very nicely."
4.0,NICE PRODUCT
1.0,"I ordered 2 Velrose , Nylon Camisole, Beige, size M  Got the wrong items
Exclusive of Decorations-Trim, Polyester, White, size S"
3.0,mine was to small and the v neck curve is not low enough so its hard to wear it with shirts that one does not bottom all the way to the neck line.
3.0,"The shoulder were way too thin, disappointing! The camisole was nice, silky,.  I  wanted a medium,it was not available @ that time. It was shipped in a timely manner."
5.0,Good fit and comfortable.
2.0,OK but not great.  Fabric is not as good as other padded-shoulder camisoles.  Not low enough in the front.
4.0,A very nice camisole.  Gets only four stars because the lace around the neck and shoulders is a little bit itchy.  Maybe that will get better with repeated washing.  We'll see.
3.0,I probably should have ordered the next size down.
2.0,"Does not fit well at all, too large on top and narrow at the bottom."
2.0,The arm holes are way too big.
3.0,This item was too large in the shoulder . I have had these camisoles from another vender and really like them but they are no longer available . Thank you .
5.0,Wish I had ordered more than one -- nicest camisole that I have ever purchased.
2.0,"Although it fit fine, it shows under most tops. The only top it doesn't show under would be a crew neck, which I don't wear."
1.0,This Camisole comes way to far up on your neck so you can't where anything to low. It is to short so I cant tuck it into my pants. Just not happy at all.
5.0,Nice!
2.0,"When I found the Velrose All-Nylon Padded-Shoulder Camisole in plus sizes, I thought I had solved my problem.  It looked like the camisole fit the model perfectly.  So I not only ordered it in white, I also ordered it in beige.

However, the shoulder pads are so high, that the rest of the top fits awkwardly around the chest and arm holes.  The fabric is cheap nylon and the camisole I received was at least 2 to 3 inches shorter than shown in the ad.

I was disappointed in my purchase and I do not recommend this product."
5.0,"I like this camisole because of it's lightly padded shoulders.  It's well made and holds up well after many, many washings."
5.0,"Loved it thanks, I will purchase it again.  It was exactly as I expected..  Will purchase it one more time."
3.0,"Runs a little small but nice.  Shoulder pads are not really there but it works okay.

It is nice under some sheer tops."
4.0,"Another hard to find item, needed a replacement after many years of use of my old one---a very slight shoulder pad, just enough to make tees fit nicer."
4.0,"This was  a little too large,  but  I felt the smaller size might be too small. I did order two white camisoles. They help my clothes fit better. Emily"
2.0,"the padding is so think that it really is not worth it, any camisole would be good enough, I wanted a better shoulder padding"
2.0,I returned this product because the whole idea of the shoulder pad was to make a difference in the over garment
5.0,"Fits the bill perfectly. I had a camisole like this and I just about wore it out. I didn't have high hopes I'd be able to find one that I would like just as much. I think this one will prove to be terrific. It has just the right amount of padding--not too much and not too little, just enough to add a bit to make my blouses and tops fit better. I'm happy and am thinking about ordering another one as well as checking out what else I can buy from the same seller. 5 stars for sure."
2.0,"I thought this would be the perfect camisole for me, but when it came the arm holes were way too big. The advertised picture does not show that to be the case. I had a $7.00 return and restocking fee to pay. Very disappointed."
5.0,"I've had this product for about a month and it's done great! Can't beat eel skin. Holds ID, cash, cards, and some business cards."
5.0,"beautiful product , and nice finishing. My wife loves it. price is great and size is good. I recommend it !"
5.0,"I love this wallet.  I've been using it for a few months now and it still looks great.  The eelskin has a nice texture to it, and it's incredibly durable.  My past leather wallets are usually showing some wear after a few months of use, but this one still looks nearly new.  It also is able to hold quite a number of credit cards and cash in the main slot.  I am also very pleased with the deep red/burgundy tone of this wallet.  I would definitely recommend it."
3.0,"I had expected something that was true credit card size. This, while good looking, is larger than I want.
Thanks"
4.0,I love the look of the ankle bracelet just wish it was made with chain instead of an elastic band.  I am so afraid it will break.  IT is beautiful!!
3.0,"The crystals were very pretty, and I loved it on my ankle and the ease of getting it on and off; however, it caught slightly on a chair and broke instantly, so caution is needed when wearing."
5.0,The Swarovski crystal with Heishi beads is beautiful and my fiance loves it. Delivered as promised. I am a huge Amazon online fan.
5.0,"I just received my anklet today.  It is beautiful, to say the least.  I have looked for anklets in stores at the mall and no one ever seems to have any. The one or two I've seen were rather child-like looking. Of course, I finally get the bright idea of looking on Amazon - and they never fail to have just what I want. I never ordered from Serenity Crystals before, but they shipped the anklet the same day I placed my order and I had it 4 days later, including the weekend! I never would have found anything close to this for what I paid online, even with shipping fees.  This is a great price for a beautiful anklet."
5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it to death.  It looks great and will fit almost any ankle size.  Would buy a second one in case the first one breaks.  All in All was a great buy.
5.0,This anklet was a good fit. Just enough stretch. Nice sparkle. I would buy it again.
5.0,This is the prettiest anklet I have ever seen!! Who needs expensive diamonds when you can have sparkling crystals like theses. I immedately ordered a necklace to go with it and cant wait to order more!! As always  love Amazon!!
4.0,"These are really soft and we love them, but they run small, even before washing. Our 6 month old won't be able to wear the 6-9 month size much longer."
5.0,"VERY PLEASED WITH THESES ITEMS

I WILL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN REAL SOON...

THANKS"
5.0,"We have ordered MORE of these we love them so much -- easy to put on and take off, launder well (they do shrink if you use high heat in the dryer)."
4.0,"I had my son at the beginning of April and he's now right at 12lbs and still wearing them.  They do shrink...the sleeves are now 3/4 legnth, but they are soft."
4.0,"We really like these - except they are not 100 % cotton- as advertised.

oh well"
1.0,Three wolves owns this ugly bear by over 9000 coolness points. The bear looks like it's constipated. It gave me cancer. That is all.
5.0,"It is the best shirt any person could ever hope to own.  Before I purchased it, I was extremely depressed, sickly and weak.  After wearing the shirt a few times, I found myself with a new sense of self.  On my next trip to the doctor I found out that my testicle cancer was magically cured and my testosterone level was 50 times that of a normal human.  I began to grow huge muscles and strength.  The women naturally began to throw themselves at me and my depression was gone.  I now walk the streets beating up random homeless people and other weak inferior beings.  I could not recommend this shirt more!"
5.0,My husband is very happy with a case to hold all his watches.
4.0,"This watch box is simple and a good value for 10 to 20 watches. The watch ""muffs"" are removable so one can store the odd ring or whatever as well. One comment is that the height is such that those monster do everything watches are a tight fit (wrapped around the muff). Not a real problem but I didn't expect it so I mention it here. Had I known, I would have bought it anyway. Watch Pavilion sent it out right away and it was packed very well."
5.0,"This watch box is almost too classy to be so functional.  It's not storage, it's presentation.  Beautiful.  This was a gift for my boyfriend and instead of keeping it in the armoire where he used to put his jewelry, he keeps it out.  It's too nice to be hidden.  Nothing bad to say about it."
5.0,This was a better gift then i thought it would be. I t was more beautifull in person then the picture .
5.0,"I ordered this box as a birthday present for my husband's rapidly growing watch collection. There are very few boxes of this size and beauty. He absolutely loves this box! There is only one catch. If you have a watch that has a particularly large face or ""rise"" to it, it will not fit well. Suggestion- I received this early enough to buy an engraved plaque to put on the front of the box to make it more personal!"
4.0,"Good construction, but I was a little disappointed, at first. The higghly glossed finish made it look ""plasticky"". But my mom lover it !. Must be genetically encoded for those above 60 years to be thrilled at things shiny <laughter>"
4.0,I ordered the watchbox for 20 watches in August 2006. The delivery of the box was flexible and the box arrived quickly. It took only a couple of weeks and the price of the box was reasonable. With the box itself I am very satisfied.
3.0,"The storage box looks, feels, and even smells great. the see through pane on the top even makes it look really expensive, and it really does its job. Down side is that it does its job on the top deck, the bottom part of the storage unit is very thin, large watches won't fit in the bottom drawer. if u have 10 big/ wide watches and some thin ones, you'll be fine."
5.0,"This is a fantastic watch display/storage case.  It is of quality construction and looks very elegant.  Each watch compartment has a nice leather type crafted pillow for your watch to wrap around.  These are nice pillows and of good construction.

The display case has plenty of room between the watches and the glass.  There is even enough room, both on the pillow and between the pillow and glass, to show off pocket watches.  This case shows off your watches very nicely.  Even my el-cheapo timex watch looks good in this case.

If I had to find something lacking, I would have but one VERY MINOR suggestion.  I think each watch compartment should be just a tad bit deeper or longer so that I could store any watch band links right with the appropriate watch.  I'm able to do that now, but not in a way the hides the extra links very well.  Like I said, a very minor complaint, not even big enough to lose a star to.

I love this case and would truely recommend it to anyone needing a place to both store and show off their watches (pocket watches included)."
4.0,"the box is very nice.  However it arrived with a chip broken off the bottom left corner.  Due to the color of the veneer and the underlying material, the damage is very noticeable."
5.0,"I'm very satisfied with this product, it has a great looking and an afoordable price."
5.0,"I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!  I have been riding for almost 15 years, and I can honestly say, that entire time I would long for good warm boots in the winter!!  I would dread getting off at some points because I knew my toes were going to throb the minute they touched the ground!  I do alot of outdoor riding, even in the winter months, and living in Northeast Pennsylvania you NEED a great pair of winter boots.  The older I got, the more I wanted durable, warm boots that were also comfortable enough to wear around the barn.  These are those boots!!  My toes stay warm even during the coldest months of winter and even during a trail ride!  They do feel a tad snug the first few times until they break in, but after that, they are wonderful.  I would recommend these boots for anyone who is looking for a durable, stylish WARM pair of winter boots!!

UPDATE APRIL 2014:

I JUST had to order another pair!  They lasted me the past 3.5 years and up until about Mid-January/Early February they were still keeping my feet considerably warmer than my warm season paddock boots.  They did start to crack and the soles were coming completely away from the rest of the boot, but I am at the barn 4-5 times a week, sometimes riding 2 or more horses a day.  They DO take a few rides to break in and they are a bit bulkier than your average paddock boot b/c of the insulation but I personally am not a fan of too small of an iron so I have had no issue with them becoming stuck in my irons.  And believe me, my trainer is big on ""drop your irons!"" and I have no problem getting my feet out or back in them.  I also don't lace them all the way up, I leave one out until they get really nice and broken in until I can do that, or my heel doesn't get as far down.  I had actually ordered a pair of Ariat Bossard Insulated Paddock Zips and sent them back b/c they were ridiculously stiff and tight.  Promptly ordered my old go too's and am happy I did because I got them in time to break them in before this winter season was over so no need to worry about that next year!  Happy riding :)"
5.0,I got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he really loved it.  Quality work and it is very pretty!! A great way to display watches!!
5.0,This my second Henschel Hat of similar design.  I sure it will give me the same fine service as the first.
4.0,"good fit, great for keeping the sun off your head"
4.0,Good fit and good price.
5.0,Great fit and feel
4.0,I use the hat for golfing.  Its perfect.
5.0,"This is my second Henschel hat. Ordered the same one that I bought years ago in Las Vegas. My old one is dirty from gardening, so wanted a new ""dinner"" hat. I have many hats...this is my fave. Thanks, Carter."
1.0,The small hat was too small and the medium hat was too large...disappointed since I liked the style
5.0,Tested it out in gale force wind while flying my rc models and I did not even use the chin strap and it is COOL on  the head. and perfect fit.
4.0,I have several Henschel hats and they all fit perfect as a medium size. For some reason this one is almost to tight. The hat is great and is cooler than any hat I own for working in the garden and yard. Hopefully it will stretch just a little bit for more comfort. I know a large would be to big so I will live with it.
5.0,Very nice for cutting yards with. Thank you
4.0,"My husband had this hat but lost it on a recent trip.  Inadvertently ordered ""medium"" instead of ""large"".  Have returned the hat and will place a new order in Large size."
4.0,my purchase was way too small.  I have an older one of these and ordered the same size.  This one was a size or two too small.
5.0,I had to return and get a Large.
5.0,Thank you it's great.
3.0,This hat is great looking but ran small.
5.0,My husband loves it!
5.0,Thrilled to find this hat!!  PERFECT for Summer!!  Love it!!!
5.0,"hubby loves it. he has two, one for the yard and one for going out."
5.0,"Great hat...!  I am a size 6 7/8th and the Medium fits perfectly.
Cool looking too...!"
4.0,Normally I wear a large hat size.  Based on some reviews that stated the sizing ran large I ordered the medium.  Not a good move since sizing appears accurate - Medium means medium.  Returned the hat to the seller (postage expensive) who exchanged the hat immediately.  Replacement fit well & looks good per my wife.  Hopefully will work well at the ocean.
4.0,good looking hat I like it a lot keeps the sun off.
5.0,"I bought a Medium.  Fits snugly.  Tried a friend's ""large"".  Too big.  Better to be 'snug' which helps keep it on in moderate winds."
5.0,"We gave this to an elder farmer friend and he loves it.  The netting on the top lets the heat vent out, The chin string keeps the hat securely in place while he's cutting hay. And, best of all, it protects his balding head, neck, and ears from the sun's harmful rays."
5.0,Really a nice cool hat. Perfect for out in the sun or in the pool. Washes up very easily.
5.0,The CoolMax Band works great. I did apply some leather softener to the string to make it less stiff.
1.0,Too small.
5.0,"This hat is just what I hoped it would be.  The top and brim are solid, providing sun protection, but the mesh allows for air circulation to keep your head cool.  It's almost identical to the Henschel khaki hat, but this one also has mesh covering the brim, giving it a different style.  Originally thought the cord was unnecessary,  but while golfing in a very strong breeze I had to use the cord to keep the hat from blowing off my head.  The cord goes around the back of the hat when not in use."
1.0,Girls like it u wl 2
5.0,Awesome hat
4.0,Liked the hat but medium was a bit too tight.  Plan to get next size up even though measured 7 1/8.
5.0,This hat will be great in hot weather.
3.0,"I got two of them, one fits fine the other is a large, the size states med but it fits my wife and she has a hat size of large, thus I would say that the label was wrong or QA issue in making the hat sizes consistence.  Looks more like the label than anything else, but this is also a QA issue.

So one fits fine the other is to large, gave it to may wife."
4.0,"Nice hat - choose your size carefully.  Also, it is somewhat ""packable"" but gets some creases."
5.0,"The fit is as I expected as it's not my first Henschel hat. I like a,nd use the strap. With a wide brim it does like to move in the wind."
5.0,great quality
5.0,"I love my Aussie hat.  It looks expensive, but it's not!  It's made very sturdy.  Should last me a long time!"
4.0,I read other reviews that these hats run on the large side so I ordered the next size down. It was too small and I should've ordered the standard size. I was able to stretch it out with some water and a small bucket and it fits fine now. It is a great hat!
5.0,"This hat has been perfect for me.  I've used it on many high altitude hikes, and around the house working!  The mesh at the top keeps me very cool and comfortable.  I will buy another one and recommend it to all of my friends"
5.0,"I really like this hat for the price!  It fits well, and I like the fabric (it looks good and it is crushable).  Also, it is a hat with a chin strap, which is important to me, it keeps it from flying away.  I would recommend this hat!"
5.0,This hat fits well and was received in just a few days.  It is just what I have been looking for.
4.0,"I love this hat. It protects me from the sun, and looks good doing it. Even after being thrown into my suitcase it comes out and looks good on my head."
5.0,Great hat for walking in the desert or working in the back yard in southern Nevada . . . Take off the leather strap - don't need it.
5.0,"Hat is just what I needed/wanted.  Fits fine, like the stiffer brim which doesn't flop."
4.0,"The hat is great and it was delivered on time and packed perfectly.  However, I ordered a MED size based on the reviewers comments that it was sized large.  I wear between a 7 1/8 and 7 1/4 so my experiece says go with the larger of the 2 if you are in between sizes.  It is a great hat and I will reorder a Large when it is in stock."
4.0,Nicely made but I'll have to wear a bandana under it-it runs a bit big
5.0,"I find myself just loving these hats,  I've  written quite a few reviews of many Henschels that I have.  For me, they are well worth it; comfort, style, practical, and well made.  All you have to do is try one or two or three!!!  CoolMax band is unique and adds to comfort, I am from Louisiana, and there is no shortness of heat and humidity here."
4.0,"I think the hat was a nice quality, especially for the price.  I was disappointed that it took a little longer than I expected for it to arrive.  And, I ordered a size smaller because most of the reviews I read said that it ran small.  It definitely did NOT run small!  I had to return it because it was way too small.  I would say that it actually ran very true to size based on my experience."
5.0,This hat is great for Summer.  My husband had one and he liked it so well that I ordered myself one.
5.0,Fantastic hat and can stuff it in tight places.
5.0,This hat is ideal for our vineyard work.  It has a wide brim and allows for some cooling with the mesh crown.
5.0,"Bought for my sweetie for his birthday.  He works outside in florida so the sweat band is great, he loved it.

Thanks."
2.0,"We bought this for my husband. He wears a 7 1/8 hat. He could not even get this hat on. Otherwise, it looks like a nice product.

Update: Work Wear Savings, the company through which the hat was purchased, sent me a return label the same day I called to say the hat was too small. They would send me a large hat when the other had arrived at their returns dept. After over 2 weeks, I had not had any email update. I called the company, learned they had received the returned hat, but that a large hat would not be available until July 14. My complaint: Why did they or Amazon not notify me by email? I do not feel I've gotten good customer service."
5.0,"Needed wider brim hat than floppy had been wearing. This hat was cheap enough to abuse and has held up well. My work requires Sunup to dark in  100 degree plus. Hat ends up under gear, on floor of truck or blowing across log yard. Would buy again, well made, pretty good fit, maybe just a little tight but not much. Don't know how it looks, don't care, don't walk around with a mirror. Don't  work in a city."
5.0,"What a great hat.  I looked and looked, and finally decided on this hat.  I wore it in Egypt and it was great.  Folded in my suitcase and my backpack.  Fit perfectly and had great breezy area so my head kept cool....and I looked cute!  Love it.  Bought one for my friend to wear also.  She loved it, too."
5.0,"He loves it!  He wears it to mow grass, garden and to fish.  Well made, airy and covers the ears which prevents those sunburned ears."
5.0,"I gave this 5 stars because it's a great item.  I bought it for my BF to do yardwork.  He's had it about 3 years now and it's still in great shape.  As a matter of fact, he wants another if I could just find it in blue.  It's easy to clean too. Just drop it in the kitchen sink and clean it up."
5.0,"I am always nagging my husband to wear a hat to protect him from the sun.  He is very picky about what he's willing to be seen in.  He's always been a boater and since this hat was designed for just that it was an instant hit for him.  It's lightweight, stylish and we even packed it in a suitcase and he used it traveling.  Every time we took it out of the suitcase it popped right back into shape.
Haven't tried washing it yet, but it is washable and that is a definite bonus!  Now we're both happy."
5.0,"Very happy with transaction, and hat. Have had one before, and was very happy to purchase another, and will purchase again and again."
5.0,I did a fair amount of research for a good hat for golf without paying a huge price for it.  This hat is good quality and the price including shipping was fair and lower than anything else that I could find.  Plus I knew that Amazon would stand behind it.
5.0,"This is the second Breezer hat I purchased in less than a week. The first hat came packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect shape. The second hat, this one, not so good. The hat was crushed. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's crushable. Nevertheless, it took some effort to return it to presentable shape. Otherwise, I love the hats. They fit well, nice shape, vent well, have a chin strap to keep it on in Kansas winds. Good product. I just wish you could count on the packaging. Oh, well, if these last as long as think they will I won't be buying another for quite a while."
5.0,This is a good light weight hat that allows for good air flow while protecting from the sun. I like the strap that can be functional or put behind ears on on hat as in picture.
5.0,"The Henschel hat I received was a perfect fit and every thing I could hope for. It's just what I needed for protection from the sun on the golf course' where I play almost every day.

Thank you for the quick service and a wonderful product.

Allen A
Ark."
4.0,Quite pleased with the Breezer - with a slight breeze and a little sweat on your hair it really does feel quite cool.  The size medium will fit a 7-1/8 but it's on the snug side.
5.0,"without telling my age,I'll just say that I've worn a lot hats and caps in my time.  From my youthful days in the cotton fields to now enjoying my retirement.  I must say that without a doubt this is the most comfortable, and definitely the coolest hat I've ever worn. Love the CoolMax headband.  Plus if you get dirt on it as I did, picking it up with dirty gloves on, It's easy to clean.  I used a wet soft bristle tooth brush with a little mild detergent, brushed the dirt away and let it air dry.
  I highly reccomend this hat for anyone.
Plus my wife says I really look good with it on!  Doesn't get any better than that!!"
5.0,"This hat is great.  It provides shade for the ears and eyes.  It is comfortabe even on the hottest days because the top venilates the head.  My skin doctor encourged me to get a hat like this because I have had some skin cancer on my ear. Lastly, the price is right."
5.0,"Bought this hat to use out in the yard when doing yard work to block the sun. It works just as I hoped it would, A quality hat that fits nice and snug and does not blow off in the wind.  Has a large brim to block the sun off the ears and back of the neck and your head still breaths with the mesh top. I would rcommend this hat. Did not understand, why UPS shipped it to the US Post Office and then the post office delivered it to my home. Waisted a day on delivery when UPS could of dilerved it the the house, which, by the way was not shipped for free!"
4.0,You can't beat Henschel for well made and reasonably priced headgear.  I have two of their breezer hats I wear for sun protection and both are great.
5.0,"The material quality was good and the style was nice. However the hat was out of shape when I opened the box. It was also a little tight. Checking their return policy I found that I would have to pay for the return shipping fee which was almost half the price of the hat itself. I decided to keep it as a working hat when I do my yard work. Few days later I received an email from their customer service asking me about how pleased I was with their product. I told them I wasn't pleased with the condition of the hat, but decided not to return due to high return shipping fee. To my surprise they sent me next day a prepaid UPS label with which I returned the hat requesting for an exchange. Yesterday I received the exchange. This time they packed the hat snuggly inside a box, which was packed inside another larger box with packing paper. Although it took long time to receive the exchange their customer service is superb. I will buy product(s) from them again in the future."
1.0,"I ordered this item for a trip I was going on where I needed a hat that not only blocked the sun but was cool as well.  The item showed in stock,  several days later I was notified the item was on back log until the 17th.  I contacted the vendor and asked them if they could expedite the shipment with the vendor, something I do routinely with my customers.  I was told they'd try.  I contacted their vendor who told me they would be shipping the items to Sportsman on the 13th.  I contact Sportsman indicating I would be leaving on the 21st and needed the item delivered the 20th and if they couldn't promise that delivery to cancel the order if it hadn't shipped by the 17th.

On the evening of the 17th they called and asked if I still wanted the item,  yes but i need it the 20th.  No problem  -- today i get a shipment notice indicating the item will be delivered the 23rd 2 days after i leave.  I don't know if i'll get the item before I leave but to pay 30% of the items cost and be told they cannot expedite the freight after they advertised it as a stock item is poor service, based upon the support i've received i'm not sure i'll be a return customer.

disappointed with amazon and sportsman for not factually indicating the stock status of item,  I understand that their computer systems may not be up to date but you don't find that out until after you place your order, and honestly I have had good experiences with Amazon until now.  But with this vendor the experience has been less than what I expect from Amazon on an item that was ordered almost 2 weeks before I needed it."
5.0,"Just what I wanted.  A little pricey but still it is what I wanted, so what the heck.  A good deal."
5.0,"This hat is perfect for sun protection in a windy situation.  It will also keep my head cool in warmer weather.  I am pleased with how it looks, and that it is packable."
5.0,"Ordered this hat because every other hat I had made my head sweat, that ran into my eyes when hiking. This hat works great, beyond expectations. Made in the U.S.A. makes it perfect. Sizing for me was right on."
5.0,"My husband only wore baseball cap style hats.  I was thrilled that he really likes this hat and now wears it all the time, and it looks great on him.  Plus, it covers his ears from sun damage, a common place for men to get skin cancer."
5.0,Yes it is nice and the mesh allows the wind to cool your head.  Can't wait for the 137 degree summer.
5.0,"My husband loves this hat.  We have bought him one a year for the last five years.  He works outside, this hat gives him the protection he needs yet it is still cool with the vented top."
5.0,This is just what I was hoping to get. It is cool inside and lets air flow through. It looks nice and the cord can be tightened to prevent it from blowing off when windy.
5.0,"I bought this for my son, and he absolutely LOVES it!  The color (khaki) is great, its adjustable chin strap is wonderful, it flattens down nicely for packing, and the mesh insert does a good job of keeping his head cool.  We are very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend buying this high-quality hat."
3.0,"These hats are okay, but I was disappointed there was no sweat shield in front like the hat I had before. I do not remember the brand of that hat,but it looked identical to these hats. Also, I washed that hat once, and it came out good. I washed one of these hats and it looked terrible, so I threw it out."
5.0,"I love the breezer hat I bought.  For golf, there is nothing better and I am going to buy another for fishing.  I do not like the leather strap that you can use to keep the hat from flying off.  I took mine off and threw it away because it was too stiff and uncomfortable and the stay device just slipped too much. For my fishing hat I am going to buy, I will put a cord and a better cinch device on myself."
5.0,Hat is well constucted and truely allows air flow to keep the sun off while not holding the heat in.  From a distance you can't even see that is isn't a regular hat.
4.0,"I bought this hat to keep the sun off the top of my head, neck and face. It does just that with the wide brims. I burn easily and wore this hat but forgot my sunscreen and got only a light burn. The air flow this hat is great and I found it comfortable even in 102 degree heat, very different from a baseball cap. My only complaint is the under chin drawstring was tied very sloppy and I don't have it tied quite right yet.
For a low cost hat it is a winner I'd recommend and buy again."
5.0,"The hat was perfect for our vacation -- fit well, was cool in the sun and offered great sun protection."
5.0,"Best camping hat I have ever owned. Tough and comfortable. The mesh crown allows good airflow over the head, the solid top prevents your skull from roasting, and the wide brim provides cool, shady face and neck proection even when the sun is low in the sky. If you want to make a fashon statement, get something else. However, if you are an outdoor person who values good, servicable gear that does what you need it to do, get this hat."
5.0,"Love this Hat. It keeps my shorn head cool and protected. The price was 1/3 that of the hat I originally considered.  One of my best purchases. .  I would not hesitate to buy another one.  The description says its crush able, but I like it so much I'm afraid to 'test' it."
5.0,Great hat
5.0,5 stars no issues
5.0,Great fit and comfort.  The vented crown provides cooling.  Be sure to measure your head and use the size chart.
4.0,"FIT GREAT, LOOKS GOOD"
5.0,"The hat was a perfect fit, what a good looking hat"
5.0,"Other than being a tad large, exactly what I was look for.  Yes, I'd recommend."
5.0,Love this hat. Highly recommend! Fits as expected. Excellent ventilation.
4.0,The hat arrived double boxed and in perfect condition. I like the hat a lot. I really need a 2XL but XL was the biggest offered. I'm thinking about putting my head on a diet and keeping the hat. It's that nice.
5.0,What a great brim and the hat is very cool.  My husband had to have a skin cancer removed from his ear lobe.  This hat has an excellent brim shades  his ears well.  Best of all he looks very handsome in the hat.
5.0,My husband loves his new hat.  Got it to keep the sun off his bald head when he mows and works outside.
5.0,"I ordered the XL because I was between sizes.  The L probably would have been a better fit, but I will stay with this size."
5.0,"Keeps me cool, and fits well."
5.0,This is a great hat  I am totally happy with the fit and the way it looks.  I would recommend this particular hat to everyone.
5.0,Very good and well made hat...
4.0,"Nice hat, the strap is rather short but other than that I find it to be comfortable to wear.  It arrived double boxed, the inside box was a little small for the hat but it popped back into shape alright. Just in time for summer!"
5.0,I love it.
5.0,Best yet
5.0,What fits well and is a good value for the price. The chin strap is a little rough but overall I am well pleased. The brim is wide enough for protection from the sun which is the main reason I bought it.
5.0,hubby wears it every day while he's working construction out in the heat.  He loves it!
4.0,Very Happy
4.0,Love Henschel Hats!!! This is my 3rd Henschel. I ordered an Extra Large and they seem to run on the smalle side.
5.0,"I purchased to use while watching a major golf tournatment and it worked great.

This hat really kept my head cool and ears shaded unlike the golf cap I typically wear. The wife and kids also commented on how nice looking it was. Have worn it many times now and wish I had purchased one earlier."
4.0,Love it
4.0,"Great style, performance and fit.  A little pricy from this vendor, but delivery was as expected."
5.0,Great hat for hot weather
5.0,"this is maybe my fourth hat like this. I have in the past bought them from a local hat shop, but Amazon had the same hat for $25 instead of $40. its comfortable, cool, and when it gets dirty, I spray it with the stuff I wash the car with, clip it to a fence and hose it off. it drips dry and looks great again. I actually get compliments every time I wear it. Now my brother wants one like it too."
4.0,"I like this hat very well,but should have measured my head first. I used another hat that fit snugly and used the size,but it was different then the Henschel. Still a nice product though. Worked well."
5.0,High quality and versatile hat. Good value for the price!
5.0,"I'll make it fit, no biggie"
4.0,I got this for function and it met my needs.  The leather band/chinstrap is not particularly comfortable when worn as a chinstrap which did knock off a star since I generally need the strap on the boat.
5.0,"Best hat I've ever owned, won't blow off in pretty extreme winds"
5.0,Great value. Buy It!
5.0,Love this hat.  I highly recommend for kayaking and sunny beach days or on the golf course.
5.0,"Haven't used it yet, but made really well. Bought it to take on a cruise."
5.0,I love your hats this is the 3rd one for me.  thanks Jerry
4.0,"Overall as expected, nice hat for strong sun."
5.0,"In the world of wide brimmed hats, this is a breath of high quality and reasonable pricing."
5.0,"Got me through the hot summer ballgames, awesome!"
5.0,Good wide brim protects face and neck from the sun and that is what I purchased it for.  The openings in the top allows air to pass thru for a cooler head.
4.0,"Like the stiffer brim, holds the shape of the hat better.  Hat would fit better if my head was a little rounder - somewhat tight at my forehead and in the back while loose on the sides.  I am guessing this will just require a bit of a break-in period."
5.0,"Great hat.  I am not a normal hat wearer but needed one for a long day activity outdoors.  The hat fit well, kept me cool, and was not too obstructive."
5.0,I have a 7.5 inch head and got the XL right fit.
5.0,Great hat for working outdoors!
2.0,Hat is stiff and uncomfortable.  I can not wear it .
5.0,Rocks my face off!
4.0,"Reorderd in this L size.  Fits great and very comfortable.  Cool and great for casual.  XL in this hat much too large, even though  a Breezer Crushable with 4"" brim was an XL, it was only slightly large and used band liner to make hat fit slightly smaller and it works great.  Order best size for yourself per sizing chart, but hats may vary enough to require a different size. But don't let that frustrate you worth the patient when you get right fit.  I happen to measure right at break point between L and XL, so it sometimes takes trial and error.  Great hats and extremely satisfied."
4.0,It was a gift for a friend.  I hope he likes it.
5.0,I have worn these hats in the past and was always happy.  I hadn't seen them for several years and was happy to find them again.
5.0,awesome hats...love them for the hot weather we are having..
5.0,"It's a nice hat, made well and looks good. The best part is that it is made in the USA."
5.0,"Hat fits, no flaws."
5.0,This is the second one I bought. Bought first one in 2012. Used it a LOT over the summers. Can't beat it for the price.
5.0,Great hat. Will buy one for my wife now.
5.0,"This is my second one. The first one, which I have had for years, is now for working around the yard, and the new one for going out in public. A really great hat. Very durable. Comfortable. The wide brim give good sun protection"
4.0,I got xlarge a bit too big but good quality.
4.0,"I bought an X-large Breezer, which was supposed to be between 7 1/2 and 7 5/8. Couldn't get it on my head. I have several x-large Breezers from about ten years ago, Which fit perfectly the first time I tried them on. Fortunately, we have an antique wooden hat stretcher, which did the trick. The old Breezers were made better, overall; but this hat is worth the $30.00."
5.0,Great Hat but The XL is a little too large. Most hats XL fits.
3.0,Had purchased this hat in Vegas and loved it. Then lost it at a football game. So when I amazon gift card for Christmas thought I would order another. This came to me with what seemed like cheaper materials and the inside crown was missing a liner.
3.0,"Despite the big box, the hat arrived very crushed.  The top has permanent wrinkles in it.  While I shaped it back out as best I could, I was disappointed in the delivery.  Other than that, the had is just what I wanted."
4.0,"Great hat!  Cool breeze flows through it, but provides great shade for my head!"
5.0,Great for our Florida sun!
5.0,love it replacing old one
3.0,"The quality was not what I expected.  There is no lining to cover the seam around the top of the hat, so that it feels very raw and prickly.  The rim is somewhat stiff.  My husband's other Hemschel hat is made much better.  This could be a second."
5.0,really good
5.0,"great hat even after all these years,,,washes well......really holds up"
5.0,"Love this hat. Light weight, provides good shade yet it allows air flow. Exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,Outstanding!  Plain an Simple.
5.0,"Fits well, good quality. I would recommend!"
4.0,This has been a good hot weather hat.  I've had it for about a year now and it is still holding together with every day use (hot weather).
5.0,"Get buy! It fits perfect, folds for packing and unfolds quite easily, and washes up to be like new. No complaints at all!  Thanks."
5.0,Love this hat! The mesh top allows the air to flow and the wide brim does an awesome job at keeping the sun off your face and neck. Quite durable too.
5.0,"best hat around, made in USA, cool with venting, nice wide brim, Ask your dermatologist, Very comfortable made in USA"
5.0,"I need a hat that will protect me from the sun. I have had 2 skin cancers. I don't like wearing a hat because my head gets hot. This hat solved all of my problems, protected me from the sun, was cool and fit right. I have used the chin string. Also the hat is awesome looking."
5.0,"I have never worn a hat or cap, but need to.  At age 71, and a frequent hiker, I would prefer it if my dermatologist had less to do at each visit.  I can't even wear a ball cap.  So far this is different, not so hot, good sun shader, and keeps light rain off the face and glasses.  Seems to be well made.  Appreciate the built in sweat band.  I ordered one size large, and it is loose, but can easily tuck tightly rolled pieces of Bounty towel behind the sweatband for a perfect adjustable fit, plus more absorbancy.  I believe, and have been told, that the hat is stylish.  This is a bonus AFIC."
4.0,I'm not a big fan of hats. I wear them to protect my scalp. The hat works and doesn't seem too awful to wear.
4.0,"Really like it.  Can crumple a lttle and bounces back  really nice hat
Great for casual or fishing
Very nice"
4.0,I was hesitant about ordering this hat. My husband had one from Henschel that was an XXL and it fit him very well. This was only an XL but it fits great! He wears if for golfing.
5.0,"This hat was reasonably priced, very well constructed IN THE USA, and fit perfectly.  I usually order a 7-5/8 or XL hat; I ordered the XL Henschel Breezer, and it fit like a glove.  I am not used to the leather tie-down, so I removed mine easily.  I wore it the first time yesterday for golf, and the sun was bright, but my head was cool all day.  I am impressed, although it was shipped slowly by this seller.  To be honest, I am spoiled by Amazon Prime, and this hat didn't receive Prime shipping."
4.0,"I purchased this for my husband who is in construction and needs protection from the sun. It is a great looking hat, however even the XL is too small for my husband."
5.0,Keep cool this summer with Henschel Breezer Hat.  It cools the heat of the sun and allows your head heat to escape in the breeze.  The chin strap keeps your hat on even in high winds.  Protecting your head from the sun's energy during solar max just makes sense.
4.0,"Keeping sun off my face in tropical locations has become a priority.  The wide brim does just that, while the mesh sides keep your head well ventilated, which reduces sweating considerably.  The chin-string is a necessity for river travel by speedboat.  For the price, this is a real nice hat.  One thing though, it looks much better after some wear when a little dirty and slightly shabby, a condition which also eliminates the ""new hat, eh"" comments when relaxing at the end of a 40 degree Celsius day with fellow ex-pats."
5.0,Great Hat.  Packs well.  I don't look stupid.  Offers excelent sun protection.  Tend to shrink after diving in pool.  Will purchase again.
5.0,Great product. Fast shipping. Thanks.
4.0,Comfortable fit.  Both stylish and useful in shading from the sun.
5.0,"Fits my 7 3/8 size head, vented crown helps keep my sweat-prone head cool, and my Dermitologist definitely approves.
( I saw an apparent knock-off at Costco today... a $10 waste, since the copy is floppy, no shapely look, and ""vented"" crown is covered on the inside, so not cool at all!)"
5.0,Thanks for your service.  It is fit very good.
5.0,nice hat
5.0,My second one of these.  The first has proved to be of exceptional durability and comfort.  Even throw it in the wash and it comes out fine.  The mesh crown allows maximum air circulation to keep your head cool (and reduce sweating).  It's too grungy now to wear anywhere but in the yard where only the dog will see it.  It was time for a new one.
4.0,"I like the Henschel hats. This was actually the 4th hat like this that I have ordered. All of the other ones were size large & they fit nicely, so once again I ordered a large, but this time the large was way too small, so I returned it & ordered an X-large which I am waiting to be delivered now."
4.0,Nice golf hat for the money
5.0,Love thIs hat
4.0,"Returned, too small. Re-ordered."
5.0,Very nice. Will enjoy wearing it often
5.0,A stylish way to replace hot baseball caps with a cooler method of protecting your ears and head from sunburn.
5.0,Fits good. I like it.
4.0,I'm a 7 1/4 hat size and ordered the large. The hat was still snug. Looks good and keeps sun off. I believe the khaki is going to show dirt and sweat easy though and may wish that I had ordered a darker color later.
5.0,Great hat
5.0,"It's cool, it's comfortable, it shades my face nicely in the Florida sun. I like it."
5.0,"Great hat for hot West Texas summers.  It's protective, comfortable, and cool.  I will buy another when this one wears out."
4.0,"Great hat! Fits perfect and is ""cool"" to wear. The only complaint was the 2 week standard shipping via FedEx Smartpost. I think a kid could have delivered it faster on his bike."
5.0,"WELL MADE,GREAT PRICE AND MADE IN THE USA.......AAA+"
5.0,"This is my second buy of this hat. I have owned one for years and my hired hand has been wearing mine for weeks. he loved it so much I bought him one in his size. He wears it all the time. great  hat, great fit. Great price"
5.0,"Great hat, I replaced a Henschel hat that I had for 10+  years. I lost my back pack on our return trip from Dominican Republic and hat was in it This newer version is lighter and more comfortable. I recommend the hat and company shipped as described, but it took about 8-10days from order date for it to arrive (July4th holiday). I am impatient and spoiled by prime delivery."
5.0,Like the hat. Comfortable and cool.
5.0,Really like hat very comfortable
4.0,does not cover my neck and sides from the sun as I thought it would but a nice hat.
5.0,Love it. Replacement for older one I had worn out. Great hat
4.0,"A little tight, but I used a hat stretcher to make it fit better.  I like the style of the hat."
5.0,"Henschel hats are a great product, they will last a long time , the fit is perfect, and keeps me from cooking in the hot sun."
5.0,"High quality,  good fit and exactly what I expected and needed.  Would definitely recommend."
5.0,"Fit as expected. Measured with a snug tape measure. Only worn it 1x, but the breeze through the hat was excellent. Construction seemed sturdy and it folded up and popped back on my test run, so I think it will be ok."
4.0,Purchased this same hat 14 years ago and it wore like iron through much yard work which caused me to purchase another that looked a little more presentable.  This ones material is not as heavy duty as first but only time will tell if it stands up
5.0,"great product, is my 3rd Henschel Hat"
5.0,"This my second hat.  The first has become my yard sun protector (I perspire pretty good), so this is my ""formal hat"" :)"
4.0,Great Hat
5.0,Great hat. This is the second one I've ordered for my husband. Good protection from the sun and looks nice as well.
5.0,"My husband's summer hat was finally wearing out and needed to be replaced. I thought I was a picky shopper but nothing met his stringent requirements - and we've been looking for years now!! Once we found this one, I bought him two so we won't have to look again for years to come. He's thrilled with the product and he looks terrific in it! (Now if we could just find winter/hunting boots to fit his 4E feet I could be very happy!)"
2.0,"It shrinks. If you have to buy it, buy one size larger."
4.0,I like the hat but I wish I had ordered the XL size.  The large was a bit small.  My head measured 23 and 1/4 inch in circumference and the size chart calls for a large to be 23 inch.  I didn't think a 1/4inch would make much difference but it does.  I steamed it and stretched it out to fit and I really like it now.
5.0,Covers ears. Mesh helps keep cool.
5.0,Nice
3.0,"its ok, a little too snug. I like it though, very light and aery."
5.0,"Perfect hat, great fit, good looking and useful.  I love it on my husband."
4.0,this is my 3rd Henschel hat of this style.  I like the mesh for cooling and the wide brim.  The other hats seemed to have fit better.  The new one is  just a shade big on my head.  My wife has a medium which is too small for me.
4.0,"A good hat for the sun, I'm just breaking it in now but in a couple of months I may have more to say."
4.0,love the hat should have got next size smaller
4.0,It's fine. I already wrote a review of this...
5.0,"My favorite hat.  I originally purchased it to protect my face and neck from the sun when I golf or fish but now I wear it all the time.  It's vented top makes it cool to wear on the hottest days.  I really like the ability to secure the hat on windy days with the chin lanyard, otherwise it stows nicely on the back rim.  They are durable, wash nicely in the dishwasher and can be reshaped.  This is my 3rd one in the last 10 years."
5.0,"This hat provides tremendous shade and will not make your head overheat. It is relatively light weight and the mesh top allows air to flow. Keep the sun off your face, ears, and neck! This can safe you a world of trouble later in life."
1.0,This is a POS!  Wash it once and watch it fall apart
5.0,"Purchased this hat for my husband, who wanted a hat that would protect his face and ears from the ferocious Florida sun. He likes it very much, although when it first arrived, it seemed just a little snug. He's decided it wasn't too tight after wearing it for a while, and decided to keep it."
4.0,"Great hat.  This particular hat is just a little bigger than the identical hat I had bought several years ago, and I had to add a piece of fabric as filler inside the band."
4.0,I just wish it fit.  I am at the bottom of the large sizing and a light breath of wind lifts it off.  Guess I will give it to someone with a bigger head and buy a medium.  This is a real downside of buying clothing here.
5.0,Great hat; fits well; American made!!  These are also very durable hats -- I've been wearing them for years and still have my first hat which I use for doing dirty jobs outside.
5.0,Love it and it worked in the luggage
4.0,"HUsband's hat - het likes everything about it except that it hits the car headrest when he drives.  I'm going to ""steam"" it and see if I can make it a little more curved."
4.0,"I don't like hats, but I use it to keep the sun off my face and neck and it works great. It was slightly large, but I added a strip of velcro inside the sweat band and it fits perfect now."
5.0,"Great hat at a reasonable price, just what we were looking for."
4.0,Great looking hat.  Ever so slightly snug.
5.0,"Arrived  right on time. It fits very well.  I think the vents work very well.  It is much cooler than my old hat which only had some small holes for vents. I can't speak to the durability yet, but am expecting it to hold up for a long time.  It seems to be of very good quality."
5.0,The hat is solid and well made. Dad is 88 and loves it.
5.0,Very nice hat. I bought it to work outside in but it is too nice to get dirty. Great fit too.
5.0,"Great hat, too big.  Sold it to friend and ordered correct size.  Thanks"
4.0,Great hat for the Arizona sun. Vents well and is very comfortable
5.0,Great hat.  My brother also liked it so I got him one also.
4.0,I like the hat as I expected it fit well and does the job I expected it to do color is exactly as described the only problem I have is it took so long to receive the item next time I will pay for upgraded shipping I would highly recommend this hat for others to purchase
4.0,The hat is real nice but the stiff leather strap is a pain.  I tried to soften it up with mink oil but it didn't work well.  I have another similar Henschel hat and the strap is a soft shoelace that lies nice and flat. It has neat appearance.  Much nicer.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,"This an awesome hat for the money, it's made with great quality right here in the U.S.A.
The fit is snug but not to tight, ( just follow the sizing chart, wrap a string around your noggin lay it out on the yard stick and thats your size ) so it stays on my head blocking the sun weather I'm  building fence, or flyfishing on the stream."
5.0,nice hat very happy with it
5.0,This is my husbands 4th hat like this.  He is outside everyday in Florida and needs this hat.  He likes this brand because it is light weight and cooler than some that are heavier.
5.0,If your mesurment calls for a large I would recommend a xl
4.0,"Slightest bit snug, but mainly because it's new. I expect it will loosen up slightly as it's worn more. Blocks the sun, but provides ventilation."
5.0,the best hiking hat could be found on the market. although the size is quite big even folded
5.0,"Hat arrived on time and in good shape, item was as described and appears well made."
5.0,"Great hat wore on my trip to the tropics,kept my head cool, looked great,eve got compliments from the street hat salesmen."
5.0,Fit as I hoped.
5.0,Excellent protection for walking the dogs in the sunshine
5.0,Bought it as a gift and he loved it. Did everything it said  it was suppose to do. Perfect fit as well!
5.0,"Nice hat, good fit.  Quick shipping."
5.0,"I wear 7 3/8 hat size, and large fits perfectly. Great looking, protection from sun, and cool. This should help my golf game."
5.0,Comfortable hat that is well made.  This is my second hat of this brand and they are great!.
5.0,Great hat
5.0,Covers head yet allows breeze during the heat of the day
4.0,"Plenty of breeze through, lots of shade, and folds essentially flat for packing.  Just what I needed for the Amazon cruise."
4.0,Henschel hats are the best
5.0,"Needed a hat for outside work that would wick away the sweat and be vented.  Fills the bill!  Good and sturdy, USA made hat.  I have a 23.0"" head and a large fit very snug, but comfortable--no room for an extra sweat band or longer hair.  I would definitely by another."
5.0,Great hat for a great price.  Comfortable and good sun protection.
5.0,keeps sun off you and lets air in so you don't overheat.
5.0,"One customer asked me where he could get one.  I work outside, and this hat is perfect for the prevention of red-neck syndrome.  Looks like it will hold up well."
5.0,"USE IT FOR TENNIS AND WALKING AROUND IN THE SUN.
DON'T GO OUT WITHOUT IT. HAVE SKIN CANCER.
THE ONLY WAY IWOULD GO OUT IN THE SUN."
5.0,"My husband is a golfer/lawn bowler so he is often out in the sun.  This hat allows his head to breathe ( no hat head ) and protects his face, especially the nose, from the sun,  It is comfortable and looks good, too.  In fact, he has ordered another one."
5.0,These fit a little large. Order a smaller size and you'll really enjoy this hat. Best of all it's made in the USA.
4.0,I like this had fit me. You have to be careful with the size if you are in between two sizes.
5.0,No more are the days of getting sun burned on my face and neck and having the people of the public mock me for my utterly disgusting sun burn.
5.0,"my dad like it alot, i got it for hi father day gift , it was delvery on time and ita great value"
5.0,"Face it: every wide brim hat is not exactly a style statement. But many are flat out dorky and ugly.  This one, however, I love.  It looks like a fedora, not a sun hat.  And as to doing its job of sun protection, it is very good.  The brim keeps sun off of my face and neck, areas where I have had to have squamous cells removed. My body temperature is cooler with the hat on than off. The open mesh allows heat to escape and for any breeze to cool my head.
My only possible caveat: the mesh is a fairly open weave. If one is bald and must keep sun from the crown of the head, then it could be a problem.  The top of the hat is solid and will protect from the noonday sun. The mesh would only be an issue for early/late sun coming in at an angle."
5.0,"Great quality hat, especially for the price!! I was very pleased to see that it was made in the USA! It seems not many clothing items are made here anymore.
 Ventilation is good, should be nice and cool, will give it a test on my next backpacking adventure and if it doesn't live up to my expectations I will update my review."
5.0,"I have been looking for a hat to wear while working in the yard during the heinously humid Summer months here in the commonwealth.  Baseball hats work, but they only keep the sun off of whatever direction the bill is facing and being a solid lid, they make my head even sweatier than it would be normally.

I started looking around for a hat that would address all those shortcomings and everywhere I looked, I kept seeing ""Henschel Breezer"".  So, more digging led me to Amazon and all the reviews of said hat.  The reviews were good, the price was right and the best part is, made in America.

Ordered it and as with all things Amazon, it arrived on time and packaged perfectly to protect it.  I've used it every weekend and numerous other times in the aforementioned heinous heat and humidity and it has performed flawlessly.  The sweatband keeps the sweat out of my eyes, the brim keeps the sun off my face and neck and the mesh keeps the top of my head nice and cool.  In essence, this hat rocks!"
5.0,"I bought this hat for a recent vacation to San Francisco area. It packed well and held up the whole trip. I am fair skinned and wanted a wide-brimmed hat to protect my face, neck, and ears from the sun. The sizing is pretty much spot on (measure your head accurately before ordering) and the hat was very comfortable for an entire day's wear. We spent a lot of time in San Jose and Santa Cruz where the temps were in the 80s and a lot of sun. The hat kept my head cool, wicked the sweat, and I didn't get burned. I did use sun block, but worried less about re-application every 80 minutes on my face, ears and neck than I did for my arms and legs.

I haven't needed to wash the hat yet, but will take the necessary precautions to try and quickly dry the brim due to it having a wire inside. I hope to use this hat for several summers."
5.0,"I ordered this hat after I was sunburned while doing yard work. The brim on this hat is large enough to cover my face, ears and the back of my neck. The ventilation is great!"
5.0,"Great value, Made in USA, durable! and DANG I look GOOD. Stop looking and BUY this hat. You'll be HAPPY."
5.0,"I got this for my brother, who drives a truck and has to stand around in the sun a lot. He says this hat is a big help and that he gets compliments. I also sent him the CoolMax arm warmer UV Protection cooling sleeves, since his arms have sun damage from the sun coming through the window. He  says the sleeves are comfortable and that his skin looks much, much better."
5.0,I am a farmer and spend a lot of time outdoors.  I need a hat that will keep me cool and wick away the sweat all while keeping the sun off of my bald head.  I'm one of those guys you see that just gushes sweat while working.  This hat is ale to keep up with that...not any easy task.  The sweat disperses all the way out to the edge of the brim allowing the proper heat transfer to cool me in addition to allowing the cool breeze the go through the mesh.  Great hat!!!
5.0,"I wear this hat, and its several predecessors, almost every day. I purchase a new one once a year after they get too best up to be presentable."
5.0,Great for doing yard work. Comfortable fit. Keeps you shaded and cool. Major plus is that you can wash it when it starts to stink.
4.0,"The hat is good looking but the fit is a little weird, the first hat that I order was a large when I put it on it was to small so I return it and got a X-large and it was to big so need less to say I kept the X-large one."
5.0,"Six years ago I bought this hat model and wore it daily when on the streets, in the boonies and hacking through brush. It withstood more than thirty washings and held its shape and ScotchGuard treatment well. This is my second and should last just as well."
2.0,"I have owned a Henschel Breezer for 5 years.  I love it but with a caveat that they are correct when they claim it is ""crushable"" but then again so is my Irish crystal - and neither return to their original shape.  But now the sizes have changed.  My large always fit like a glove, the new one in large arrived packed very nicely in a big box but the hat was huge on me.  I returned it for a medium.  It arrive in a very small box ""Pre-Crushed"" if you will.  I would have returned it for that reason alone but it was so small that it hurt to force it on my head.  Not happy with Henschel ""quality control"" or the shipper's packing. I will continue my hunt for this style hat elsewhere."
5.0,"Quick delivery, great price, good fit.  I was not used to wearing a hat with a brim; always wore a golf cap.  I needed a hat for sun protection and I get great complements when I wear this hat at golf."
5.0,"Do you hate having the sun beat down on you, and then sweating buckets because your hat doesn't let your head vent?  I do, and in the summer spend a good amount of time outside and on the water where the sun's rays really start to cook you.  I can also vouch the the keeper strap will keep your hat with you and not floating away somewhere.

This hat is crushable, breathable and after 1 years use, looks as good as the day it arrived.  Plus this is a quality product made here in the U.S. of A."
5.0,"I think you can buy this or very similar hats in a lot of places, but I trusted the reviews on this Henschel and am not disappointed.  It is nice and lightweight, yet durable.  And it fits perfectly, shading the sun while reducing sweating.  And of course, it can be folded up and retain its shape.  My only regret is that it's not quite as ""stylin'"" as my Australian Barmah hat (think Crocidile Dundee).

While I was looking at a similar brand in a store, a 20-something woman asked the clerk for an outdoor hat for her husband.  The clerk recommended these hats, to which she said, ""Those?  They look like Chinese rice farmer hats!""  So... I guess ""stylin'"" is a relative thing, eh?  :)"
5.0,"The hat lived up to its description.  It packs well inside of a suitcase & then quickly resumes its original shape when you unpack it.  The ventilation material in the top portion/crown of the hat keeps the top of your head cool, and the hat's wide brim keeps the sunlight out of your eyes.  The hat's style suits both women and men."
5.0,My husband had this style and brand of the hat before and needed a new one.  The hat came in a timely manner even though it was back-ordered for a few days.  Distributor kept in touch so we knew the status.
4.0,"The hat was delivered promptly, the price was reasonable, and the product lived up to all of it's descriptions on Amazon.  I would be happy to purchase from this seller again."
5.0,"After searching for a hat with a broad brim that would satisfy both me and my dermatologist, I took a chance and ordered the Breezer, sight unseen.  It lives up to the claims made in the description, including the ability to collapse for packing in a suitcase and still look good when unpacked. It's well constructed and sturdy without being heavy.  The fact that it's made in the US and still comes at a good price makes it all the more appealing. It's comfortable and sharp - not at all 'geeky'!"
5.0,"I purchased this hat for my teenage son who was traveling to the Dominican Republic on a mission trip.  We chose this hat for the wide, sturdy brim and the mesh which rings the entire hat.  He reports the hat shielded him from the sun and also kept his head cool.  He was able to easily pack it into his backpack; it returned to its former shape very well.  We also loved that this hat was made in the USA!"
5.0,"This order came promptly in time to wear it on our vacation to Croatia.  It was good for the sunny, hot days and also held on for wind.  The size was a little bit too large, but we will put in a filler to handle that.
We'll take it on many trips to come."
5.0,"The coolest hat in the world. If there is a breeze blowing you imagine you are sitting in the shade, under a large tree."
4.0,"I really like this hat!  I walk every day and wanted a hat to keep the sun off my face, neck, and ears. I looked around a lot before settling on this one.  I like how it is open at the top to allow for ventilation.  It would be easy for a hat like this to get really hot without that convenience."
5.0,The hat was shipped quickly and is just as it was described! Good quality and nice looking. I'm looking forward to wearing it on a safari in Africa this summer.
5.0,My husband works in the heat and loves this hat.  It keeps him cool.
5.0,Very nice hat. I use it for dog walking and other times that I go out in the sun. Great product.
5.0,"The merchandise was beautiful, and the shipping was surprisingly quick.  I'd order from them again."
5.0,Superb.
2.0,large as hel!!
4.0,"This shirt is very nice. I do wish that I had looked for a wrinkle resistant option, but that was my mistake. Came quickly."
5.0,Perfect ring to wear occasionally with your wedding band.  Simple and elegant.  Solid ring.
1.0,"I have NEVER even received the ring! I was sent the wrong ring(which was $13 cheaper), had to pay to mail the ring back, and have never received a refund, a response from the seller or the correct ring."
5.0,This ring turned out to be just as beautiful in person as it is in the picture.  Great quality!
4.0,It woul be good if I could purchase two shorts of different colors on the same order
5.0,"I was very pleased with this item. The quality of this product overall is excellant. Most hankerchiefs are of whats called a standard size (12 X 12), but this product was much larger (16 X 16). The hankerchiefs hold up well when washed however they do come out wrinkled so I would suggest ironing them. Using bleach also keeps the product looking pure white & brand new. The bleach isn't harsh on the product at all. I was surprised that this item shipped fast. I ordered on one day & about four days later I received it. This item fits in all sorts of mail boxes both large & small. So don't worry if your not home when it arrives because it should fit in your mailbox. My transaction was pleasant & sweet. I had no problems with the seller at all. I received nothing, but courtesy & respect. I would most defintly buy from this seller again. I do believe that the item was some what on the pricey end however I don't buy hankerchiefs on a daily and/or regular basis to know enough about that."
4.0,"I've washed my hankies four or five times now, and the hems are holding tight. These are heavy cotton handkerchiefs and a very good value."
4.0,Handkerchiefs are hard to find in many stores.  These handkerchiefs look good after going through the washer and dryer and do not require ironing.
5.0,I was looking for 100% cotton handkerchiefs at a reasonable price.  This satisfied that need.
5.0,"Excellent product, good service.  Hard to find item in most stores."
5.0,The handkerchiefs are beautiful.  The order came promptly in good order. Will definitely be repeating business with this business.
4.0,An excellent value - but without permapress they'll be a little wrinkled straight out of the dryer.
3.0,"We use 100% cotton handkerchiefs instead of Kleenex in our house, so I keep several dozen on hand.  I wash them in hot water and bleach them frequently, especially during cold and/or allergy season.  I bought two dozen of these.  After I washed these handkerchiefs for the first time, hems on about 1/3 of the handkerchiefs showed signs of fraying. I think that the quality of the cotton cloth is fine, but the tiny hems don't have enough seam allowance to prevent the fraying. I intend to pull out my sewing machine and repair the frayed hems right away, and I feel sure that the handkerchiefs will serve us well after that.  I didn't want to pay top dollar for handkerchiefs when we use so many."
5.0,"After a LOT of searching on the internet, I found these, 100%, cotton handkerchiefs and use them every day! The product is perfectly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier!"
5.0,A perfect belated Christmas gift for my father- quality and a good price!
4.0,"This product is outstanding and the price on Amazon can not be beat. Buxton owns the rights to the Dopp name and produces these ""official Dopp"" kits. The leather is good, feels solid and well stitched, but you can also get them in a slightly less expensive PVC leatherette version. You can also find these in some stores although the ones I found were double in price. Sometimes the bottoms are leather and sometimes the bottoms were a beaded plastic. Frankly I made sure to get the beaded plastic as it will last longer than a leather bottom. The key features if this Dopp kit are: 1) Construction feels solid. (Although the tag says made in China...you would feel better if it had a proud to be made in the USA tag...however, I don't think this is an issue here.) The leather and stitching feels strong. The zipper is a hefty enough piece of metal that will last. The leather handle is small enough that it fits under the fold of the kit's side if you do not want to use it. The inside is a traditional liner with a single razor pouch, however, the liner and pouch feel like they are made of a newer composite plastic material than the older plastic liners these type of kits used to have. The liner feels stronger and I doubt it will rip, which often happened with travel kits. 2) It has Dopp stamped on it, on two flaps/tabs. The tabs are aesthetic choices but look good and remind you that you have a ""real"" Dopp and not some random ""Men's Toiletry Bag.""  There are newer types of ""Dopp"" kit's out there made out of nylon mesh. If you like that I would recommend something by L.L. Bean or Swiss Army. But for something more traditional I would only recommend this brand right here..."
5.0,"I didn't buy it on Amazon but I have one and had to relate this.  I make a lot of short and long trips and keep mine in a garment bag, but unfortunately that bag has a bad zipper.  My black Dopp bag fell out onto the middle of a city street late at night.  I didn't realize it for several hours, and went out to look for it.  A number of items in the bag were crushed - the bag had obviously been run over by cars.  But the bag itself hardly showed any wear.  Pretty amazing."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful Dopp kit and so classy. The leather was very nice and the quality on the stitching and zipper was great. Unfortunately it was just a little too big for me as I only pack a couple things and needed it more for just weekend trips. Had to return but wouldn't hesitate to buy again if I wanted something a little larger.
5.0,"Had mine for two years, not showing any signs of wear, really nice shaving kit."
5.0,The simple and classic design has stood the test of time and is very utilitarian.
5.0,"It was sent as a birthday present. I didn't see it, But the recipient was pleased."
5.0,Well made and handsome. I like it a great deal.
5.0,I bought this Dopp Kit for my Grandson. I bought one in 1956 while I was in the U.S. Army and it was the ultimate that not everyone had. I wanted my Grandson to be like me by having the best. Dopp Kits are still Number 1.
5.0,best dopp bag Ive owned.
5.0,Had one just like it for twenty-plus years. It's the perfect size to carry my things & looks and feels durable.
5.0,This item is exactly what I wanted.  My husband is very pleased.
5.0,Plenty of space and a classy look.
5.0,"I ordered this as a gift for my husband in May 2014. It's now January 2017 and this Dopp kit has held up amazingly well he uses it on an almost daily basis to carry his toiletries to the gym, and packs it into our luggage whenever we go on a trip, and it doesn't look any worse for the wear. The wide top which stays open is very convenient especially when there's a mix of large and small items. It's also structured and feels like a quality product in hand, and doesn't get crushed when thrown into a bag.

I anticipate this lasting for many years to come, which makes it an excellent value. (Dopp, would you guys make this in some more colors so I can grab one too?)"
5.0,"The Admiral Dopp kit is a classic! Very nice leather. It has a sophisticated, timeless look and feel."
5.0,This smells like my father's old leather Dopp kit and that is exactly what I was after.
4.0,Bought 3 of these for my Grandsons and they seem well made but they are pretty dark; I would call it charcoal and not Brown. The leather does not scratch easy which is a plus.
5.0,Great buy greater purchase
5.0,A great bag but it's more chocolate brown than saddle.
5.0,Well constructed stylish and lots of room
5.0,great little bathroom travel bag. I love it!@
5.0,"Fantastic quality, very sturdy, stays open and looks polished!"
5.0,Very nice quality - fast delivery
5.0,Nice construction.  Not a cheap pseudo leather.
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little larger than it appears inside.  Plenty of room for what I need.  The case is rigid but may soften after some use but it's good the way it is.  It opens wide and stays open.  Room enough to pack everything you need when you travel.  I was trying to decide between this one and the larger version.  I glad I chose this one.  The size is just right for me.
5.0,"Husband loves it. It's the closest thing to an old Dopp he'd had for thirty years which had finally started to come apart. Good quality. We ordered the 'brown', and it is a very dark brown."
5.0,This is a great shaving kit. It's really easy to use and find your toiletries.
5.0,Great size for the basics. Can't beat the quality for the price and I am sure some black leather shoe polish when required will extend its life even further! Definitely would buy again.
1.0,Color was not as depicted.  Unsatisfactory.  Returned
5.0,Got this for my dad at Christmas.  The leather is nice and it opens up great and stands up.  It's great quality.
5.0,My husband likes his Dopp Kit.  It stays open while he uses it.
3.0,The leather is a little shiny and looks like plastic.  But you get what you pay for.  It is roomy and holds all the required items.  My son is happy with it.
4.0,Very well-made the only thing I don't like is the rigid bottom
5.0,This is the second one I got. High quality material and a perfect size to fit everything you need in there. I definitely recommend.
4.0,"Very nice traditional-style leather dopp kit.  Lightweight, nice lining, rather pricey but feels more upscale (despite somewhat thin leather) than cheaper ones.  Will it last?  Aside from a little higher-end feel and look, whether it lasts long will be the real test."
4.0,"Purchased this on January 2015, and i gotta say this worth every penny i spent. I was looking for a simple, understated travel kit with no extra compartments or embossed logo on the exterior, and this is exactly what i want.

Pros:
- Feels and smells like genuine leather, smooth leather. (It's better to use leather care lotion once in a while as mine has started to show some creases, probably due to hot weather)
- Neat and strong stitching along the bottom, the opening, and the inner artificial fabric (see photos)
- Bottom material is made of waterproof artificial fabric, wide and hard
Cons:
- I wish the inside pouch were slightly bigger, with a zipper so stuff won't fall off, and can store more stuff
- Holds less and more expensive than my Nautica travel kit (see photos)

Overall, it's a great product, and with little ocassional care i'm sure this will lasts for years."
3.0,Thought would've larger
3.0,It is a leather bag with a zipper down the middle and a lining on the inside.  If that is all you need then it will work fine to hold your soaps and such
5.0,"Amazing bag, good quality and perfect for a man who wants an awesome bag."
3.0,"Good quality.  Works well,  if it were just an inch bigger."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted! Perfect!
5.0,"I had a Dopp Kit in the early 70's when I was a teenager and somehow lost track of it.  After wearing out the plastic travel bag I've had since then, I wanted to go back to the classic Dopp.  The Admiral did not disappoint - it's a great travel companion!  The sides are a nice, soft leather, the bottom a vinyl which is appropriate, given that the bag will be placed on wet countertops.  The stand-up top stays open for easy retrieval of essentials then securely snaps shut; the bag is closed by a heavy-duty zipper.  Inside the bag is a water-resistant liner with one side pocket for small items. The Admiral Dopp is really lightweight but very well made and stows nicely in an overnight bag - a handsome, high-quality, timeless design.  It's a pleasure when the small things in life work well."
5.0,"Relly feel like high quality, Nice leather, hard bottom(little heavy tought), and shape is good to store under vanity or in travel case. Prefer the Dopp over the Fossil witch is higher in height and price. And it's nice to have the ""original"" one."
5.0,"Perfect size. Holds all my husbands essentials including electric razor, plus the top stands open for easy access."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,Great kit.  Very well built.  Perfect size for travel.  Love the hinged closure - having the walls stay upright is so convenient.  Seems like it will last forever.
5.0,Husband loves this!  Excellent quality.
5.0,"High quality construction.  Good for shorter trips or if your toilet kit is made up of a few things.  Overall, a good product and worth the money."
5.0,Works as advertised!
5.0,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend. He was very pleased with the purchase. I didn't realize but really like that the bag has hinges that allow the top to open completely. Very nice touch.
4.0,"Larger than I expected, excellent delivery"
4.0,HANDSOME CARRIER FOR SHAVING ACCESSORIES AND/OR TOILETRIES. APPEARS WELL MADE.
5.0,"Darker than shown, very happy with this product."
5.0,Great kit
5.0,Good sized bag. All the room you need to carry a reasonable amount of personal goods.
5.0,Very nice!! Ordered these for groomsmen gifts and they loved them! Very fast shipping (needed that..groom was late deciding on gifts!)  Highly recommend!
5.0,This is the second Dopp Admiral Travel Kit we've bought.  The first one was in 1968.  It was a gift for my husband's graduation from the Naval Academy.  He was in the Navy for 36 years.  It finally wore out.
5.0,"I bought one of these 25 years ago and abused it frequently while working 24 hour shifts as a paramedic. After it finally started to wear out I searched all over for another one. It's a little expensive, but if it lasts 25 years too, it will be a bargain!"
5.0,Great kit. Sturdy. My husband loves it. It stays open (unlike his old Dopp kit) while he gathers his grooming items. Makes life easier on trips.
5.0,"As advertised, a quality item.  Very happy with transaction."
5.0,Great travel kit. Holds a lot. Love the leather. Looks great.  Really like it.
5.0,It may seem expensive for a bag to throw your shaving stuff and toothbrush in but it is a real nice bag. Quality leather and craftsmanship. Received it as a gift and don't think ill ever need another one or want one. This one seems to have the quality to stick around a while.
5.0,I use this every time I travel.  It's well made and not too big.  I was concerned about it being too small but it's just right.  If anything it keeps me from packing more stuff than necessary.  Great item.
4.0,"Bought this knowing it was small and it certainly is.  Might take some getting used to, but I'll appreciate the less space it takes in my luggage.  Bought some smaller size toothpaste, etc.; should work fine.  Point is, if you want a regular sized one, get a different model.  All that said, the Dopp itself is great.  Clearly well-made and will undoubtedly be durable.  Functional (like the plastic lined pocket inside) yet attractive (for what that matters).  Completely satisfied."
5.0,I use this for my makeup and it fits everything in it and feels like it will last for many years!
5.0,"Guys, this is the only grooming kit you'll ever need. Stylish and practical. Easily cleanable. Everything's very neatly contained inside. Essential gear for dudes. Seriously."
5.0,This was a replacement for Dad's old Dopp kit.  He loves it. I tried a different style but he prefers the Dopp.
4.0,I may buy me one too.  I bought these for my sons to have for the rest of there lives.  We'll see how that works.
5.0,My husband had been looking for this type kit for years so I went to google typed it in and it was under the tree for Christmas. He loves it.
5.0,"This classic design is largely unchanged over the years.  If you're looking for a manly piece of kit that will serve you well for years, this is it.  Everything about this bag feels manly and timeless.  High praise for a grooming bag, I know, but there's a reason that Dopp's name is synonymous with grooming bags.

The quality and feel of this bag are well worth the money."
5.0,This item was reminiscent of the Dopp kitt my dad owned and his dad owned.  Old school quality at a very reasonable price!
4.0,The kit is very sturdy and looks good. The only complaint is it is too sturdy and isn't flexible for odd shaped items.
5.0,"It fits the need of traveling with toiletries. It's a very simple design and made from sturdy materials. Should last a long time. This isn't a fancy bag. It you're looking for lots of compartments or pockets, look else where."
5.0,"When I decided to give my husband a new Dopp kit at Christmas, as usual, I went to Amazon's website and found exactly what I was looking for -- black, zippered, with extra compartment.  The price was competitive and the service is always without equal when I purchase products through Amazon."
4.0,This is a great kit.  My husband really liked it but it's too large to carry in his workout bag to take to the gym.  We had to replace it with a smaller Dopp kit.
5.0,"Bought this for my son to replace his vinyl kit. I told him the quality ones will last forever, mine has."
4.0,"I got this for my Dad for Christmas. It was to replace one that he had for years that was worn out.  It was just the right size to fit everything in it (except a can of shaving creme).  He was very happy with it and is using in all his travels.  Good quality and good value. I think he was concerned that it cost me too much, which is always a nice feeling that you got someone a present that they think cost a lot more than it did."
5.0,Have been using a cloth kit for too many years.  Just like the one I had about 35 years ago while in the service.  Great product.
5.0,The bag seems sturdy with good quality leather. I especially like how the opening of the bag is reinforced with metal so it stays open wide making it easier to find things.
4.0,This was a nice kit for the price but was a little smaller than I had hoped.  My husband does most of his traveling by car so we don't use the little airline approved containers.  It would probably be a very nice size if you used those.
5.0,Kit just as advertised!! For the price the quality is exceptional. Just what I was looking for. Would buy again if I ever needed another. Extremly happy with purchase.
5.0,Buxton always make a great product. Got my first one aboutd the time I went off to college.
5.0,This is a great shirt at a a great price. Sizing is accurate. Shirt is well made and has minimal shrinkage.
3.0,"I bought this for my 8 1/2 year old son.  The helmet itself was huge, can fit an adult with no problems. Because of this, it basically ""floated"" on my sons head. As for the face protector working by a touch of a button and the electronic recording, these were the selling characteristics. BUT, too pricey for not having enough positive things to balance out the negative...not enough to keep a childs interest.  My son enjoyed it the first couple of days but has not picked it up since. I also think if it fit better, (had a padded plactic skull frame inside for a snug fit) it would rate better and people wouldn't mind paying the asking price so much."
2.0,"My son likes the idea of having an astronaut helmet, but it is so poorly made and low tech that it does not come close to warranting the high price.  The face shield broke on the first use.  It's a very poor value."
5.0,"My seven year old son got this for his birthday and then used it as part of his Halloween costume.  It is large as noted in other reviews:  My husband has no problem wearing it.  However, my four year old also wears it without a problem."
4.0,"My son loved this so much! He used with with the astronaut suit and was very happy that he looked so realistic. It is a little big on him, but works fine. Also, I noticed in some reviews that some adults bought this for costumes for themselves... it fits my husband well and his head is pretty big."
4.0,"I got this for my grandson's 4th birthday. He's very interested in space and wanted a helmet. This one is super cool but very large. His grandfather could also wear it with ease.  They suggest padding it with foam, so we'll try that.  But he was wearing it around and having fun opening and closing the visor at his party. Could hardly get him to take it off.  He wants it for Halloween, and combined with the orange space suit, he should look very authentic."
4.0,"My four year old son loves it, the only thing is that it runs very large.  He doesn't seem to mind at all!!"
4.0,"I bought this for my 7 yr old son to wear at his school halloween party and it was a BIG hit.  All of the kids thought it was a great finishing touch to his costume with the automatic visor and sounds.  The only down side was the weight and bulkiness of the helmet.  My son felt it was too hard to walk around in, so he carried it most of the time.  It's now a great decorative touch to his space themed room, that he can pick up and play with from time to time."
1.0,"This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child.  There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price."
5.0,"I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably!  While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable.

Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours.  The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter.

I plan on putting together an astronaut suit for this, and it would be a perfect outfit for Halloween parties!"
4.0,Son loves it.  Decent quality.
5.0,My son wanted to dress like August Pullman from Wonder for literary day and this is perfect!
5.0,awesome.
5.0,"My daughter loves this item. My high score is based on her feedback. She thinks it's great!

From my part, it's pretty cheaply made and I don't know how long it will hold up, and the sound is pretty poor, but she is happy, so I'm fine with it."
5.0,My son has Autism and when he seen the movie Wonder he wanted a helmet Just Like the little boy :) So we ordered this 1..HE LOVES LOVES it!!!!!! THANK U ( NOT Cheap Made)
5.0,Bought this for my godson - he absolutely loves it!!
5.0,"This helmet was a HIT!!!  The 'countdown' audio is fantastic and the helmet is worth the money.  Please be aware the helmet is large--my 4yr old used it for his astronaut costume last Halloween, but had to keep is hand on one side of the helmet to prevent it from moving around.  Me, his mother, can wear the helmet comfortably, so that gives you an idea of the size.  Nevertheless the helmet was key to making the costume ADORABLE, so I would buy it again!"
5.0,This is a great toy! I am a kid and I love this thing! It is great to make movies with. I would recommend but make sure that your child should be at least 8 or 9
5.0,8 year old son LOVES this helmet.  It was top xmas list gift.
1.0,Cute design.  Cheaply made. No clear spot to place batteries for sound.
5.0,My child loved this helmet and had fun wearing it to all his Halloween events. The only problem was that it did get heavy for him to wear after a while.
2.0,Bought this for our 11 year old for Christmas. It is an adult size in fact it fit on me. Too big for a child to wear.
5.0,Bought this to go with a NASA space outfit & a book about space travel with his name all thru it - he is going to live it.
5.0,"My 11 year old loves it.  It fits me too, so we might have to share."
3.0,"This was advertised as a child's helmet, and while it was super cool, it fit my 25 year old son with a big head very well, and obviously didn't begin to fit on my three year old grandson. It is a full size adult helmet inside, so buy it for yourself, but not the kiddies."
5.0,worth the price
3.0,"Not the best quality, but good for costumes. Pretty big, bulky, and heavy."
5.0,My grandson loved this sound like he wears it all the time it's a little big for a 4 year old but he'll grow into it
5.0,Awesome costume!
5.0,My 8 year old loved it and even got told by a NASA employee that this helmet was very life like. The NASA employee was very impressed! Great Halloween thanks to this helmet! We matched it with the Aeromax orange space suit and my daughter absolutely loved it!
4.0,The helmet is great and makes the perfect addition to the Astronaut costume. The only issue with it is it bigger than I thought it would be for a childs head. We did use the reccomendations to add foam around the base to make it stay upright. Other than that I would highly reccomend this helmet to anyone!
5.0,Better quality than expected
5.0,Came in package looks great my boys love it! Goes with matching orange space suit perfectly!!! Will post pics soon. Sounds are only heard inside helmet can barely hear iaytside which is nice for me since other toys are loud. Automatic open visit feature is cool and play headset makes the look. I wish buttons on front worked but it's large and my kids love it.
5.0,"Helmet is high quality and a great value for the price. Lots of nice little details. Plastic feels heavy, not thin or brittle.

NOTE: I am a pretty big guy (6'3"", big head), and this is a pretty snug fit, maybe even slightly uncomfortable. If you have a big neck/shoulders, might be too small. I know this wasn't really made for me though, so not going to take a star away or whatever. For an affordable addition to my Halloween costume, it's good."
5.0,"my 9 year old son loves it. worth the price. comfortable, button to flip the visor and button that sounds like ground control. matches the suit from the same company which is also awesome!"
5.0,Can't get it off of her head!
3.0,the helmet already broke when using two times.
5.0,"My daughter loves it. I wish it had an actual radio inside so that i could communicate with my kiddo when she goes on her ""missions""."
3.0,The sounds were not working out of box. Assuming batteries are dead but won't know until I get more to try. I don't know what sounds are like yet.
4.0,"Got this for my 7 yr. old grandson.  He loved it but his sister broke the face piece the day after he got it by lifting it manually.  Totally the fault of the sister, not of the product.  So i would recommend that the child you get this for understands that they cannot lift the face piece but let the helmet do it."
5.0,The helmet and moon boots were a  big hit with my grandson! They artived quickly and in excellentwms!!  condition. Nice it
5.0,"4 year old grandson loved this, even though it was big enough to fit on my head! You'll definitely need some window strip foam to secure the space for littler heads. Packaging was pretty rickety. It was hard to wrap because of this issue. So 1 star off for that, but overall very happy with the product itself. Thank you for a nice Christmas present!!"
5.0,I purchased this helmet for my 8 year old grandson for his birthday and he really liked it.  The quality seems to be quite good.  I would recommend this item.
5.0,A hit!  This helmet is wonderful !  It talks and the buttons on the side open the face guard thingy.  We bought it for Halloween but this is still getting use in May in the playroom.
5.0,Got it for Halloween but its a pain to take on and off to take shots.
4.0,kind of small and tight. Hard to get on without hurting kids ears
5.0,Great product.  Both grandchildren have  already spent hours in the  astronaut  suit and Helmut communicating with launch officials and pretending to be their favorite astronaut.
4.0,"Bought it for a costume. Fits my giant 26"" adult head just fine. The microphone sounds a little fuzzy, but I didn't buy it for that."
5.0,"Awesome helmut with ""real"" microphone that mimicks a space landing. My 10 year old son used as part of a class project. He loved it! We'll keep and reuse for Halloween."
3.0,It was alittle to big and out of shape
5.0,"Kiddo loves this helmet....LOVES this helmet.  The visor tends to pop out but is easily replaced.  It's got buttons, sounds and a fake microphone; how can you go wrong?  I (Dad) wish I could play with this.  Yes, I tried to get my head into the helmet."
5.0,This helmet mad my twins Halloween costume perfect!! They received so many compliments!
5.0,Completed the costume for my daughter's school project!
1.0,This helmet is LOW quality and arrives breaking apart at the seams. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
5.0,Boys loved it
5.0,"My grandson (5), loves his new astronaut helmet and spacesuit.  Was a big hit on career day at Kindergarten!  Many thanks for such a quality product."
3.0,Cool helmet but very big for a smaller kids head.
4.0,The helmet was a great addition to the suit.  The audio could be a bit louder.  He was thrilled with it!  Hoping for a future astronaut!
5.0,Huge hit with my four year old. He still uses it well after Halloween.
5.0,"We bought this for our (small-for-his-age) 4 year old for Halloween. It was a little heavy for him.  He only wore it during our trip to the Target for their pre-Halloween in-store event. He was the talk of the store.

This fits onto an adult. The talking inside the helmet is not too loud. The edge of the stickers started peeling off the outside of the helmet within the first day but could probably be fixed with a dot of super-fast drying glue.

Overall we are really happy with the purchase."
1.0,"I was a little disappointed in this item. It seemed a little ""cheap"".  The only working parts were the dubious visor and a button that played a recording. I was hoping for more."
3.0,"Size barely fits an adult's shoulders, unsure how this is a kid's helmet. Quality is great though."
3.0,Somewhat disappointed. Expected it to have a few more audio features.
3.0,Great quality. Very large. I bought for my 4 year old who had a big head and it is very roomy. It even fit the adult's heads. My only complaint is that the buttons for the shield and microphone are in the outside of the helmet and hard for my little guy to find himself.
5.0,"Fun sounds, nice helmet, great fun play"
5.0,"Was a super hit with my son and his Halloween costume. Although I might have made a fatal mistake by letting him play with it before the 31st, when it came to go trick or treating he did not want to wear it. Love the sounds it makes and the flip up visor. I have had just as much fun with it as he has!"
5.0,Thanks!
5.0,love it!!!
5.0,"I bought this for my son because he loves dressing up like an astronaut.  It's very big and it actually fits my very large head (my head is slightly too large for the last setting on most adjustable caps).  It also seems to be pretty durable as he tosses it around like it's made of steel.  Because it fits me, I have to dress up like an astronaut with him by putting on the helmet, but that's just a plus in my book.  The visor spring latch is a very cool function.  The blastoff sound is the same countdown over and over and is a bit repetitive, but I can overlook that because of the other cool features."
4.0,10y/o Halloween costume. he received lots of complements.
5.0,"Awesome helmet, this item was for my son holloween costume, it worked great!"
5.0,My 8 yr old never leaves this behind
5.0,An awesome accessory to an astronaut costume.
3.0,Fun and looks good. Mechanism broke quickly.
5.0,"This helmet was a great addition to my son's astronaut costume:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aeromax-Jr-Astronaut-Suit-with-Embroidered-Cap-and-NASA-patches-WHITE-Size-8-10/dp/B000FGM3SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aeromax Jr. Astronaut Suit with Embroidered Cap and NASA patches, WHITE, Size 8/10</a>&nbsp;He loves space, and was so happy with this costume, especially the helmet.  The smile on his face made this the best buy ever."
1.0,"Came on time, in a comically huge box. Overall, an overpriced piece of plastic junk. The seam down the center is crooked and the parts on front weren't even snapped together. This would be fine for something that cost $5.00. Amazon sells it for over $20.
 One button opens the visor, but this function broke almost right away. Another button does nothing but cause a loud, low quality voice screaming a countdown, followed by the sound of a ROCKET BLASTING OFF. I should point out the speaker is inside the helmet, right beside the wearers ear. It does this at top volume and the only way to stop it is to take it apart."
3.0,too hot to wear for extended time
2.0,The idea is great....But the helmet fits adults better than a child.  My child ended up carrying the helmet for Halloween because it was WAY too big for her head.
5.0,I bought this for my six year old's Halloween costume after the Aeromax Youth Astronaut Helmet was too small.  This one was perfect for him and he  spent a good part of the weeks leading up to Halloween just wandering around the house wearing the helmet.  The buttons that play the sounds and raise the visor have both been getting a vigorous workout and have held up well.
5.0,"The helmet is a bit big for my 6 yr old. But it is really nice, and looks awesome!"
4.0,Awesome helmet. My son loves it except the sound for the intercom is so low no one else can even hear it.
4.0,"Really appreciate the quick delivery and it was delivered on Sunday!!!. I like it as it has the sound etc, But it is actually too big for my son, it seems like I can wear it :) . I have not opened it, so will return it.

returning this item is too expensive. the 0$ free drop off is too far for me and for amazon locker I need to spend 6.88$!!!. and Pickup is 12.88$$. I wish this item did fit my son, really wished, but it is too big.

I need to return this item, Please help."
5.0,I wish I could have recorded my granddaughter when she got this helmet.  She's going to be an astronaut for Halloween.  We ordered the rest of the costume and it's really really nice. We might have a future astronaut on our hands!
2.0,"This is TOO HUGE to be a ""JR"" helmet. Great quality and fun functionality, but really be ware of how huge this thing is for a small child. It is slightly on the heavy side so with large size it tends to slide up or down the head for an uncomfortable position for a child."
3.0,Kids actually LOVE these helmets. 3 stars bc one of them arrived broken and we had to return it.
5.0,My 5 yr old son won't take it off! The release button for the hood is so fun too!
5.0,Them helmut is fantastic and fits everybody.
5.0,My 4 & 6 year old love this helmet.  It easily fits my sons 'big' head with no problem.  Perfect for this upcoming Halloween.
5.0,"We had originally received a defective helmet from an Amazon seller.  The defect was in the visor.  The visor would not stay shut even though we had followed the directions and only used the button for opening.  However, Aeromax toys offered a replacement helmet to replace the defective helmet that we had received .  I have now edited my original review.  We have now received the new helmet and are very pleased with it.  Aeromax toys was very kind and professional, and I am impressed that they reached out to us.  My little astronaut is very happy with her new helmet!  We now have a complete costume and have been happy with all of the the other Aeromax astronaut products.  Thank you Aeromax toys."
5.0,The kids love it a year later the speaker is broken but the rest very sturdy has handled being thrown and pulled by 2 and 3 yo ordering another so they stop fighting over it-
5.0,Adorable!
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,"Bought this for my 4 and 2 year olds... they love them. They seem sturdy enough that they'll get several years of play out of them. I'm an average-sized guy, and i can fit it on my head pretty comfortably."
5.0,Excellent.
5.0,"TERRIFIC!!!  My 4yo absolutley loves this!  I think its great that he can hear it inside the helmet, but its not super loud (like other toys) for those us on the outside!  It is a little big, but no big deal for us!"
3.0,Very cool but too big for a 3 year old.. a cub strap or something would help
5.0,It was a hit!
1.0,"As shown, it looks great in pictures and there really is no alternative if you want a real-looking astronaut outfit.  But it is just a painted plastic shell with 2 buttons.  My daughter accidentally pushed the visor back and broke the button -now it won't stay down.  There's a note about that, but hard to explain to a 5yr old that it's a ""one and done"" rule.  Again, it will look great in pictures, but it's an expensive piece of plastic."
5.0,my grandson LOVES this. He is 3 1/2 and loves rockets and wants to be an astronaut. He loves to wear his suit ans his helmet.
4.0,Cool product. good quality. Works perfectly as described.
4.0,Well received.
5.0,"My grandson loves this helmet! He is 3; but wears adult size hats. This fit him great!  He usually doesn't like things covering his face, but he doesn't seem to mind this one. The front shield opens easily.  The speech is clear and he can understand what they are saying."
5.0,"We used it as a prop in a classroom video.  It was perfect and a huge hit with the students.  They loved the visor being able to pop open, and, of course, the launch countdown."
5.0,My son love it!
4.0,Looks cool but somewhat of a tough fit since it wobbles a lot.  Sure does make a great costume overall when added to other sets.
4.0,Made well Just wish the speaker was louder and said more than just 1 saying.  Other than that My 10 year old loves it.
3.0,Just too big for kids ages 6 and 8.
5.0,Fun toy for my toddler
5.0,"My 3 year old grandson became so excited as he opened this gift. He loves it, especially the audio countdown. It is too big really for his head, but he doesn't seem to care."
5.0,Goes great with the astronaut suit. Sound is not too loud for little ears. Good quality.
5.0,Great addition for a child's costume!
5.0,Kids loved it
5.0,"My son loves it.  My wife get's a kick out of it.  I think it's awesome. It's huge! it fits like it should - so my little one isn't going to get his noggin stuck in it.  The sound volume is perfect - too low to be annoying and just right for the wearer.  I think this is one of those presents that will hang around for a while. Oh, one negative thing - I'm not sure it really is negative - The face plate fell off after a few hours of tough play.  Now normally I would call that a bust, but not in this case.  I like the way the plate can be reattached - but I also like that my little astronaut isn't too confined. It's just a little piece of mind that he's not going to suffocate - I know it's safe - I just don't want to be that parent who find out in the emergency room that my little adventurer was the victim of parental stupidity."
5.0,It was worth the price! It is sturdy and held up to my son opening and closing the visor over and over. He dropped it several times (and tossed it) and I was able to snap the visor back on. It is heavy which is okay for my son he is a big boy. For a skinner child you may need to add cushion in the helmet.
4.0,"I like this helmet very much, however it is a one size fits all.
I bought this outfit to go with the Jr. Astronaut Suite Orange size 2-3 for my 3T year old son.  Wish they made it a bit smaller as well, otherwise it will be a 5 star."
5.0,"My son used this for his Halloween costume (we used Rubie's Astronaut Costume) and it was a HUGE hit. He looked like a real astronaut, got an enormous amount of compliments. Everyone asked where I got the helmet! It's very nice, not cheap at all. I was very pleasantly surprised. It came in a big, nice box. The visor goes up and down with the push of a button which my son loves, and the sounds are really cool. It's very comfortable and actually fits kids and adults both. It's has grooves where it rests on your shoulders so it sits nicely. Perfectly comfortable for hours of wear."
5.0,"Great helmet! My son loved it. It is really huge, though. Easily fits my husband. With the astronaut costume, though, it seems to 'fit' well. The sound can be heard only when the helmet is on and it's not too loud. My son has dropped this a few times and once was hard enough that it slightly cracked the visor. Everything still works, though!!"
5.0,Loved it! Bought it for my Halloween costume. Fit me (adult) well
5.0,Super for a kid
4.0,"Most of the time the sound works, but on occasion it doesn't.  Otherwise this is a great costume piece for a 7yo (a little big, but does fit okay).  Would also fit an adult."
2.0,This was super cool. Until I took it out of the box. The construction is pretty chincy (despite the price tag) and the batteries died right after I got it. This will not hold up under the use of a child.
4.0,"Kids loved it. A bit big for preteens, but its ok. Its fun."
4.0,"My son loved this, and so did all the kids at school. It looks so much cooler than the baseball cap they give with the jumpsuit for the astronaut costume. It opens and closes with a little maneuvering, but my 5 yr old had no problem working it. It also makes awesome transmission sounds. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five was because of it being a little bigger than I'd like, which gave my son some trouble seeing when it would rotate as he turned, but not bad enough not to recommend. It's big but lightweight enough to be comfortable."
1.0,"Looks nice, but it is absolutely huge on my kids. They could not wear it. Good fit on an average sized adult. Visor mechanism is weak and unreliable. Had to fix it right out of the box."
5.0,"He loves this helmet. It's a bit large, but it works great. Very durable & worth the money!"
5.0,My eight year son loves it!
5.0,perfect for show production
5.0,"Purchased for my niece to compliment her astronaut costume and this just made the outfit complete.  Plenty big and she thinks I am the best Aunt ever.  Highly recommend this for any child that wishes to become an astronaut. This allows their imagination to completely come alive in all facets.  Plus love the Mission Control countdown that takes place.  Don't recommend this for children younger than 5 as it does run large in size.  There is ample grow room, but you can add some additional foam padding if needed.  Very well assembled and will provide hours of fun filled play.  Just what the costume needed!"
5.0,So awesome! My son loved it
5.0,This helmet is so fun! My son wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween and this accessory makes it a lot more fun with the suit!
5.0,"This is perfect for a Halloween costume.  It is rather big and doesn't sit perfectly on my 7 year olds head but he loves it and it looks adorable and will be great for trick or treating and playing with leading up to and after halloween. I would recommend this item. It completes the halloween costume and 7 year old son wears it in the car, sitting on the couch, anywhere. :)"
5.0,My 5 year old loves it.
5.0,"My son loves his helmet. It's cool, I'm not sure 35 dollars cool because it seems cheaply made. The out fit together looks pretty neat though. It fits him fine he's an average sized 7 year old boy."
5.0,Larger than I expected but fits my 6 year old perfectly and he loves the sounds it makes.
5.0,Bought as a gift
3.0,Broke after a week.  Not good for tough kids.
5.0,Fit my 10 year old grandson. Loves it!
4.0,"Grandson loves it.  Appears well made.  And there are warning labels not to submerge it underwater or wear for protection.  Has good count down to blast off sounds but no other ""communications"" which would have been nice.  Also the microphone you see is non operational which would also have been nice if it did.  However, it does have a spring loaded visor that flips up with the push of a button.  I would buy this again."
5.0,This helmet is HUGE.  Can easily fit an adult.  It has provided hours of fun for our whole family!
4.0,"My 5 yr old loves it although big, he loves it. BUT, I fear he is going to drop it and it may crack. Ours does NOT make ANY sound AT ALL. I would have bought a less expensive one but they didn't have his size and he didn't want the cloth one. I would have returned it but my son loves it."
5.0,It has blast off sound effects and an automatic visor! So fancy.
3.0,Face shield broke easily and sound never worked correctly.
4.0,My 4 year old nephew really enjoys this!  It fits him and fits adults as well.
3.0,"Cool concept, but not really durable enough to be a kids toy.  Movable face shield is constantly coming off and has come off so many times that it is loose every time I reattach it."
5.0,My son loves the helmet it complete is costume
4.0,"Good quality, my son is 4, he loves astronaut, so it has been
9 months and he still play with it."
5.0,"Our 8-year-old has used this quite a bit in the six months we've had it.  Admittedly she's not rough on her toys, but it has held up well to what I'd consider 'regular' play.  She is quick to make sure people aren't handling it wrong when she lets friends or family 'play' with it."
5.0,Daughter loves this!
5.0,Just as described. This was for a birthday present for a 5 year old. I am sure he will think it is amazing!
5.0,This helmet was part of my son's astronaut Halloween costume and it really tied the whole thing together. He won a contest and got so many compliments.
2.0,Not very well made considering the cost. Face mask switch broke within 2 minutes and was not abused.
2.0,Disappointing. Its' simplicity would only satisfy a 2 to 4 year old but it is sooo big it would only fit a 5 year old. Decals fell off quickly and audio is too low and garbled to understand. It is so cheaply made it comes with directions to buy extra foam to pad the inside.
5.0,Exactly as described. good quality. Received fast.
5.0,"I got this for my 10 year old grandson to go with his astronaut suit for school career day. Although quite pricey, the helmet was a perfect fit and everything worked fine on it. He was thrilled and I was happy to please him!"
4.0,"Very cute and fun. Big however, big enough for an adult to wear. Maybe ok on small child but they will take it off after a little bite because of weight. Has held up well over many years of playing with it. Mic fail after about a year or so."
2.0,"My 5-year-old son preferred another helmet we already had because this one is so big and heavy and the sound effects are superfluous, really just annoying. This fits a teenager or adult better than a child."
5.0,grand daughter loved it.
2.0,"My four year old loves it, but has to hold it on her head the entire time. It's too big for her head. It fits my head better. The visor won't stay close and we've only had it for 12 hours."
1.0,too easy for little ones to break...
2.0,The volume is too low and it fits way too big on a five year old
5.0,Item arrived on time and in good condition. We requested as a gift and it arrived in a beautiful blue bag. We were satisfied.  It was bought for a 9 year old girl and she loved it! Especially since has a countdown button to it.
5.0,My son used this for a Neil Armstrong project at school- it was a huge hit!!!  LOVE the sound affects!
5.0,performs as expected
4.0,"The helmet works well, but my 6 yr. old grandson is still a bit young for it.  We are waiting to see if he plays with it when he gets a bit older"
1.0,"This item is not even remotely child-sized. It's huge, and fit my husband  (who has a huge head.) No padding so it's very uncomfortable. The visor and sounds arrived broken, and the helmet split in half."
5.0,"Bought three of these for the grandsons. To infinity and beyond! My grown son can even wear this, but my daughter-in-law says he has to share with the boys, he doesn't need own."
2.0,"This helmet is part of the Aeromax Astronaut costume and while it is fun and has clever buttons on it, there is only one message that plays when you hit the button.  Secondly, the visor arrived broken.  Parts are cheap and cheaply put together.  Not worth the money."
1.0,The face shield broke after three days of my son wearing it! Very disappointed!
2.0,Over priced. Large for a 4 year old. Would just wobble around on his shoulders. He would have to hold it with both hands when wearing it. Not very practical. The boom mic is for show and only plays 2 recorded messages.
2.0,"My biggest issue with this item is that it is very large, almost to big for most young children.  It was purchased for a 3 1/2 year old and the helmet is way to big for her.  The product easily fits adults.  The manufacturer should offer it in at least a couple of different sizes."
1.0,"Just received this item for my son's birthday, I paid for new one and received a used one without the boom, thanks can't wait to return this."
1.0,Thought it was the greatest thing ever until my kid put it on and has been complaining every second that it's too big  we have tried everything  to get it to fit but its imposable  the helmet is actually too big on my husband
4.0,"I bought these for my kids (5yr) and they are HUGE. I considered returning them because they are so giant - adult sized. The kids don't seem to mind, but they definitely were a lot bigger than I was expecting. Otherwise, the transaction was pretty straightforward - I received them on time and they are exactly what I thought they would be. And the batteries were included, which was nice!"
5.0,This thing is so cool
5.0,Great costume
4.0,Great helmet but it would be nice is you can adjust it to fit.... I was able to wear it at 37yrs old....
5.0,Perfect for what I needed...I am an adult and it fit my head just fine. Great for a costume or dress up...
4.0,Such a fun helmet for my daughter who had already purchased a full NASA costume suit!
5.0,Supper my child enormously enjoys it.
5.0,Awesome helmet.  Used three times already.  Pretty inexpensive considering the quality
4.0,Grandson loved it. Wore it for Halloween.
5.0,I have purchased 2 of these and they are very durable.
3.0,Too big for the kids but they still like it !!
5.0,"This was a big hit on Halloween.  My son had found a Nasa suit at Goodwill, and this helmet was all the rage.  Our kids ended up on the cover of the local paper!  It makes a couple of cool sounds (which you can only really hear from inside the helmet), and has a button to open the visor."
5.0,The 6 yr. old loved it and it fit.
3.0,Helmet is really big and is hard to keep on child's head.  Quality is less than expected for price.
4.0,fits huge on the head.
5.0,all good
5.0,Got this for my nine year old last year for his astronaut costume and is still going strong this year. Good investment. The glass part is also cute because he can pop it up with a button on the side of the helmet by the joint. You have to manually close it. Still very roomy inside and can fit my big headed 14 year old sufficiently also.
3.0,Just okay for us - the kids love it but this thing is huge.  I bought it to wear for halloween and its really not good for that....fine around the house for dress up / pretend but my 6yo wouldn't be able to walk around outside with this on for any length of time.  he ended up wearing the baseball cap that came with the Astronaut suit.
3.0,"Cool astronaut helmet, unfortunately it was without sound. Halloween costume so not as peeved as I would have been if sound had been important!"
3.0,My son hated it! I didn't sit on his shoulders good. It went well with the outfit he had but unfortunately he had it off more than he had it on. I think it's neat and totally completed the outfit but it was uncomfortable for him to wear.
5.0,It's adorable. Just what I wanted
5.0,Arrived in 2 days! My son loves this. We LOVE Amazon!
5.0,"It was my sons birthday present, he didn't let go for more than a week. There is a button for the visor release and on the other side one to activate an audio fragment that's counting down to lift off (its not loud! just right). Sturdy quality compared to most toys."
4.0,"Bought this to put away for Christmas after researching a bunch and previously ordering another one I had to return due to it being so cheaply made.  Looks good, speaker quality seems fine, sturdy visor.  Plastic a little thinner than I thought with a seam with clips running down the middle of the helmet.  I guess if it were heavier plastic it would be just that, heavy.  Will update after Christmas if does not hold up."
4.0,"I really like this helmet.  It fits both me and my 4 yr old without feeling claustrophobic.  The only thing that I don't like is the button placement.  When I bought this helmet, I thought the red, blue, and green buttons on the front would be the buttons that operated the speakers and visor flipping mechanism.  But I was wrong.  The buttons on the front are faux buttons.  The buttons to operate the speakers and visor flipping mechanism are on the side of the helmet towards the top.  The right button triggers the helmet flipping mechanism and the left button triggers the speaker.  My son has played with this helmet for about a month now and the helmet still works good.  The only thing that I'm concerned about is the visor staying closed.  It takes some finagling to get it to latch sometimes which worries me.  But it still works right now.  I'll update my post if it ever fails."
5.0,I wear it more than my son. He loves that too. This is great fun any time.
3.0,"My son loves to play dress up and loves space, so I had to try this out! We bought it, the boots and gloves to go along w/the actual costume when he was 4 for Christmas. It's cute but pretty cumbersome. Doesn't sit still on the shoulders b/c nothing is holding it on, but still fun, little sister likes it too! It has a button that says stuff and the visor opens at the push of a button, thought that was pretty cool! For dress-up, it's fine, but probably wouldn't be fun to wear all night for Halloween as it would just bounce around uncomfortably while they ran from house to house."
4.0,My son likes the helmet and will wear it with an astronaut costume for Halloween.  Con: The helmet is so big it actually fits my adult father and I will have to add foam strips to make it fit my 6 year old son better.  But it is still a good buy for the price.  The package was very easy to open.
4.0,pretty durable and my son doesnt mind how big it is
1.0,I had purchased the deluxe version of this. ( my band is space themed and we are putting together a space suit for the drummer) this was the cheapest piece of crap for $30 the only thing I even ended up using was the visor and I stuck it onto an old motorcycle helmet and covered it in white duct tape. Under $5
5.0,My son LOVES this helmet
5.0,"Our 3 1/2 year old grandson was so excited when he opened this gift on Christmas. He loves space related items and he really got into ""astronaut mode"". We had also given him, along with this, a ""Rocket Ship"" tent and he was in heaven(or space)!! Great purchase!"
1.0,Arrived with the sounds barely audible. I will have to purchase 3 new 1.5 batteries and hope that fixes it. Ver disappointed.
3.0,bought it to be weird at parties....great for kids
5.0,"Every little boy and girl should get one of these. Yes, it's big in size - but sooooo much fun. Well made, great sound, my little guy became an instant astronaut and wanted to live in the helmet. I bought it with the orange spacesuit for a great way to encourage little ones to reach for the stars. My 3 year old nephew had no problems with the extra size and he loved it that we could take turns wearing the helmet. Highly recommend."
5.0,"My sin has a NASA suit and this was the perfect find for him.  It is big enough inside for his head, he is 7 and big for his age.  Unique item and best price- I looked!"
4.0,"I bought the helmet to complete my nephew's astronaut costume. He loves this helmet. He's only 3, so the helmet is definitely oversize for him, he wears 4T in clothing. He loves to push the button to hear the astronaut voice counting down for blast off. This is a great playtime helmet, helps him really imagine he's an astronaut."
1.0,"Not only was this overpriced, it's very poorly made and too heavy for a young child to wear!  Not worth it at all."
3.0,it's very cheaply made. It broke within the first week of having it. The visor cracked right away. Great for pretend paly though.
4.0,"We bought this helmet for our 2.5 year old daughter who is obsessed with space.  It is a great helmet and she loves playing with it, but it is quite large. Even though we expected it to be a little big for our toddler, we didn't think it would fit us!  I can easily wear it with room to spare.  Very fun toy though."
1.0,"I got this for my son figuring he can wear it for Halloween this year 2014. He is the recommeded age group. Even when I added a winter hat on his head. I will attempt to buy some sort of foam however he may be scared of the added foam since it will have to be very thick to take up the space in the helmet.

This helmet fits me and I am 49 years old.

Unless your 5 year old and above has a HUGE head I doubt it will ever fit until he gets to be of adult age.

Hope this helps someone make an informed decision."
4.0,"My Grandson (age 3 1/2) loved the helmet.  He couldn't believe the sounds it made.
He thought he was a real astronaut!  The only problem was that it was too big.  The
fact that he was small, made the helmet sit on his shoulders.  My son said he would put
some thick foam in the top if he needed it.  My grandson loves the helmet!"
5.0,My 5 year old son loves his new helmet!  I bought him a different one a year ago and this is much better quality!
5.0,"Was worried it wouldn't fit my 11 year old grandson, but it did.  He had to portray John Glenn in a school report and it added so much to his costume."
5.0,lil girls will love it too!!! my 6 old love when it does the countdown. make sure you get all the accessories they will love it.
4.0,"My son loves this. My only complaint is that it can break if you raise and lower the visor manually instead of using the button, so might not be the best purchase for a smaller kid who might not understand that."
4.0,"I knew this item would be too big, but my 6.5 year old daughter loves it anyway. Sometimes the visor opens while it is being stored in the astronaut backpack.  Only has one recorded message.  Powered visor is a nice feature.  Both buttons are labeled on the sides with stickers, not sure how long the stickers will stay on.  NASA logo has been painted on the back of the helmet (not shown in photo).  Fake buttons on front are painted (so glad their not stickers).  Thick plastic, so it should be durable.  Helmet is two pieces glued together, I hope the glue holds.  My daughter is very gentle with her stuff so it should last a long time.  For the quality, I feel I paid too much, but compared to the other options that I could find, it was worth it to pay more for this and hope we can get 3 years out of it, versus paying less and getting 3-6 months."
5.0,Bought this for my 3 year old nephew. A little big for his head but he loved it!! Has a countdown to blast off that is heard inside. May have been a little over priced but cute.
3.0,"As some reviewers said it lacks of cushion support on the shoulders, the foam is too thin. It bothers the kid after a while. You need to change that foam for something more dense. It's hard to close the retractable shield."
3.0,Little cumbersome for small hands and he felt it was too heavy to move around.  Maybe when he is older it will be better. He is three and a half
5.0,I bought the astronaut suit and this helmet for our grandson for Christmas and it was his favorite gift. It was awesome to watch him open it!
5.0,Very cool my 5 yr old grandson really loved it!! Looks like it came straight from Nasa..he's ready for take-off!
3.0,"This helmet is aesthetically very cute and is made of a durable plastic. The intercom has no volume control however, the volume is not too loud for a small child. My 8 year old daughter wore this helmet for Halloween.  As many others have complained, this helmet is too oversized for smaller children; I can fit my head inside the helmet and still have some room left over, with no problem. Even my daughter, looked somewhat like a bobble-head with the huge helmet over her head! But what is worse, is the push-button visor feature; it is impractical for a helmet that is labeled ""junior"" & marketed for children, to only operate with a pushbutton feature. The push-lock feature used to close the visor, should be the same feature used to open itnot a push button. As many others have stated in the reviews, this makes the helmet more prone to malfunction or to be easily broken if mishandled or dropped. My daughter only wore this helmet  for 24 hours on Halloween; after hours of pushing & releasing the visor/button all day, I carefully put the helmet back in the box. I started to walk away & heard the visor pop-up and release on it's own, in the box. After, removing the helmet from the box, I observed the visor would no longer work it was broken. I was able to return and exchange it with Amazon, hassle free. But the point is, it should not have broken after 24hrs use; that visor button needs to be redesigned as it is flawed & impractical."
1.0,"sadly, i choose to ignore the other postings about this being a very large helmut. my four year old was totally smitten once he saw the photograph of this and he was so excited to get it. it is HUGE. absolutely, unbearably huge. causes much frustration and sadness in my son. it is big on his dad. i tried to fit it with foam strips but that didn't work. it is just that huge. also, the price? really?"
3.0,Very big and cumbersome.  My 7 year old son could not walk around with it and see where he was going.  I put in LOTS of padding and it still did not fit.  It sits in his room on a shelf instead of an active toy.  He did like the sounds and visor that moved.
3.0,"Looks really cool but my son couldn't wear it for long because it was so big. If it had a tighter feel on his head, he would have loved it."
4.0,"kids love it.  The speaker inside is cool.  I gave it four stars for durability.  The face plate doesn't always retract when you press the button.  It's approximately three years old & still holding up.  great purchase, I'd buy it again for a friend!"
4.0,"My 3 year old wears this almost every day, and has for the past 2 months. This helmet is fun, it is a little fragile although apparently more durable than it looks or than the box warnings indicate. (I do have careful kids.) It is pretty well made (except for the foam on the shoulder cut outs that was gone from the helmet in a hour) , It has a speaker that talks basically to the child/person wearing the helmet. The talking is VERY quiet -thank you helmet maker!- you can hardly hear it if you yourself are not wearing the helmet. This also means it is at a low enough output that it is easier on the ears of the wearer. Although at 3.5 years old it is a little big for him,y son really really likes this helmet- I am sure he would recommend it!"
5.0,"Great helmet! My son loves playing with it! The quality is really good for the price and it gets banged around, still works...we've had it for about 4 months and still working like a charm"
5.0,"I think this is the best investment I have ever spent.  I DJ'd all night in this helmet.  I am an adult, and this helmet is BIG.  The spring loaded visor is great.  The intercom thing is worthless, but thats alright-who wants that anyways?  I was a great hit at the Halloween party I worked.  AXE had it right- Nothing beats an astronaut.  [...]"
1.0,"the earphone was missing, which contains the power portion of the helmet. Hopefully they will accept the return. I paid a lot for it."
2.0,"Please listen to the multiple reviews. This item is way too big for kids. It is sized for teenagers and adults. Cheap poor quality. If my son didn't see me open it I would return it, but he saw it and wants to try and play with it. Like other reviewer stated it makes your kid a bobble head. Don't waste money on it."
5.0,"Perfect for 8 year old.  He has never had the luck of finding a costume hat/helmet that fit until this one!  It might be a little large for some children, but buy some weatherstripping from your local hardware, line the inside, and you will have a great helmet that will grow with your little one. Excellent quality"
4.0,as does my 7 year old.  Like other reviewers have indicated...this think is very large and easily fits an adult (as evidenced by the adults who may have modeled it in our home).  The battery wore out fairly quickly but considering how much it was used that isn't surprising.  Definitely would buy again but I am not sure how practical it will be for the halloween custume.
5.0,"I bought this helmet for my almost 3 year old grandson.  He loves it because it looks like an authentic astronaut helmet.
It is a little too large for a 2 year old, but he can still wear it.  I know he will enjoy it for many years.  The quality of the product is excellent!"
1.0,"There is no way this is made for 5 year olds. This thing almost goes around my sons shoulders even, It is even a little big on me. I would not recommend this for anyone that is wanting it for a child unless they have a HUGE head."
4.0,My son got this a couple of years ago and still plays with it. My only complaint is that it is too big for his head. It doesn't deter him from playing with it but it doesn't stay on his head very well.
5.0,I purchased the Aeromax Jr. Astronaut Helmet with sounds for Halloween. My grandson has worn it everyday and everywhere since the package arrived. It is durable and cute. People has such a positive response to his costume. There is a microphone on the inside. A button to make mission control sounds and another button to pop open the grey face mask. It is adorable.
3.0,I got this helmet for my nephews 4th birthday he played with it for a minute but it was a lot bigger than expected it turned him into a walking Bobble head it's best used as display due to the large size
1.0,"We ordered this for our son's 7th birthday, because it says one size fits all, and is designed for a child. However, this does NOT fit at all, in any way. It is HUGE! About three times the width of my son's head, and it does NOT stay on! It rolls off, or tips, no matter what he does. The front is so tall, that when he flips the visor up, the remaining white part of the front covers nearly his entire bottom half of his face...poorly designed and built, and definitely NOT build with a child this age in mind. My son still wants to play with it, but is constantly getting frustrated because it will not stay on his head. He has to walk holding onto it with his hands, for it to stay on...would not have purchased, had I realized this, and would return for a refund if it would not have been part of his main birthday gift. If he chooses to let it go before our time runs out for returns, then we will be sending it back, as I am sorely disappointed with it, and hate seeing my son so frustrated on his birthday, with an item that he has been wanting to get for over a year now."
5.0,Got this for my nephews birthday. He is 4 and although it is large he has not taken it off since he got it. He runs around with it on laughing. I think it was a good value. I know my nephew is highly satisfied. :)
5.0,Cute as it can be! We have a real astronaut on our hands. It really looks authentic. Thanks for the great service.
5.0,My wife and I purchased this for a four year old nephew who is having an extended hospital stay.  He simply loved it and it gave him a great distraction from all that goes on at a children's hospital.
3.0,Seller was great and shipped product promptly.  It arrived and was exactly as shown.  Product is a bit cheap though.  The inside microphone piece broke off on first use and had to be crazy glued back on.  But it hasn't come off again since.  The visor also can be a bit tricky and sometimes won't stay down BUT my son loves it none the less.
5.0,My 8 year old loved this helmet. He had no trouble with the size at all. Good product- I would recommend it.
4.0,My son loved it and received tons of compliments!! I would definitely recommend this product. Just make sure to use the button when opening the front visor versus pushing it up manually.
5.0,Bought this helmet to go along with my grandson's astronaut costume and he loves it.  It was plenty big and the sounds are great.
5.0,OUr four year old loves this- the sounds and voice are great and the make and design are easy to place over head and fun to wear
5.0,"It's a little big for my 4 yo son, but he loves anything space related, so he doesn't seem to mind , he will grow into it."
3.0,The helmet was really neat but lacking in quality a bit. The sounds only worked for about 2 months and the visor fell off the first time it was dropped. We could put the visor back on but it was very loose and kept falling off from running with it on.
5.0,If you could have seen the look on her face when she opend the box you would have know n  how much she loved it !!!!!!!  This is the second one we purchased ........the other was for her cousin and he loves it also !!!!!!!  We found his at the Kennedy Museum in Boston originally !!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,Gave this to my 6 year old grandson for Christmas and it was a huge hit! His parents report he plays with it all the time. It does all that it promised and seems well made. I would definitely recommend this for any budding astronaut!
4.0,Our grandson wants to be an astronaut and he was so excited to receive this wonderful gift for Christmas. Our gift to him was a success
5.0,Absolutely adorable.  We bought it to match the NASA jumpsuit we bought at the Space Museum.  The grandkids loved it.
5.0,If you have a 5+ year boy who wants to be an astronaut this is a perfect gift.  My grandson loved it.  Plus he was the hit of his party - wouldn't let go of it
1.0,"We bought this as part of our son's Halloween costume. The product is called Jr, but I have to wonder what size of child they are talking about. It is HUGE. Our son had to hold onto it to keep it on his head. Honestly it was like he had a huge bowl on top of his  head. You have to put some serious padding in there and redesign the inside to get it to work properly. My husband and I both tried it on our head and it was still too big. The buttons and sound work, but not really well. For the price, it think it would be better to just create one out of paper mache."
4.0,This is a cute astronaut helmet for my five old daughter. And if she is not wearing it her stuffed animals are
5.0,"This helmet is HUGE.  Big enough for an adult male to wear ... and he did.  For kids, just pad with a hand towel or something.  My son wore it and just held the fronts so he could see out."
5.0,"So much fun to see our 2 1/2 year old grandson in his one piece fuzzy PJ's run around with this huge helmet.  He certainly looked like an alien from the 60 and 70's.  He loved it even if he could not quite reach the buttons,  it is sized for a larger child (ages 3+) but with help we managed.  There is not a lot of rocketship stuff for that age so ordered it knowing it would probably be too big. Appears to be solidly constructed.  I appreciate the volume of the countdown,  it is not too loud."
5.0,it can be improved. I mean tree button in the front part can be flashed ones.it can be more interactive.
5.0,My daughter was an astronaut for Halloween.  This helmet was the perfect completion to her outfit.  She loved it!  Highly recommend. Sidenote: It does run a bit large.  It was still wearable but she would have liked for it to be a bit smaller.
5.0,arrived when expected..packed well.  fit perfect.  my son loved it.  completed his astronaut costume perfectly.  would definately recommend.  Good value for the price.
5.0,"Made the evening for my 5 year old, he was the envy of all boys.  Yes, it's a little large, but not so much that he can't play with it."
5.0,My son loves this helmet.  We bought it as part of halloween costume but I'm sure he will play with it for years to come!
5.0,"Bought this helmet for my 8 yo son who wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween. He already had a NASA flight suit, just needed something to complete the outfit. This helmet complemented the suit perfectly and he really loved the functionality. The visor opens at the push of a button (spring loaded) and there is a speaker inside that plays some mission control audio when you push another button. Sturdy enough to play with it on and looks decent. It is large, an adult head fits in there, but this did not cause any issues. He loved it and was grinning ear to ear the whole time. The only con I see is the price which is on the expensive side. Overall I'm glad we purchased it and would definitely recommend it as a costume accessory."
5.0,Ordered this for my son's Halloween costume.  Very good quality.  All of the kids at his school party were fascinated with it.  It has become a favorite dress up toy at home.  It was very large but took the advice of another reviewer and used thick foam weather stripping to make it smaller.
1.0,"I bought this item online (from MMPLiving through Amazon)  few months ago as a gift on my son's birthday. The product arrived on time and looked like the one on the picture; however, I made the mistake of not taking it out of the package and check the functionality right then. Later I found that the sound did not work and it was a big disappointment. The front visor functionality worked though. I remember when I bought this item from a local store few years ago for my nephew, the sound worked well and the product was a lot of fun for him."
5.0,Great buy! My son loves it! A little pricey for an accessory  but well worth it! This made the Halloween costume!
2.0,"Got these for my kids Halloween costume. They definitely look cool and my kids were really excited. However, they don't fit well and my kids really didn't end up wearing them. They are so look on their heads, basically just sit on their shoulders, and they are expensive. I don't think they were worth the money. The do look good in the Halloween pictures but no real play value because the kids don't like to wear them."
4.0,Bought this for my 6 year old son for Halloween and it is really big but we put some weather strips in and it fits better now. It talks and he loves it and so do the other kids that want to be astronauts next Halloween now.
5.0,"My son has a developmental delay and letting him make his own choices is a big part of his therapy.  We sat down 2 months ago and went through pages of halloween costumes and when he saw the astronaut costume, he got so excited and told me this one was it.  This costume was so great!!!  Everyone loved it, asked me where we got it from and my son just loved the attention.  Now that halloween is done, I'm sure he will continue to play dress-up almost daily.  Definitely worth the money!!!!!
I also bought the jumpsuit and the boots that match the helmet!!"
4.0,MMy son loves it. But we had to pad it out to make it fit. It is big enough for an adult.
5.0,"I gave this helmet 5 stars because, overall, it is a really cool item.  The durability isn't all that great, as the microphone inside the helmet broke off the day that we got it....but that really didn't take away from the hours of fun my 5 year old son got from it.  It runs rather large, as I could easily put it on my head.  If you have a young one that wants to be an astronaut for Halloween (or just for dress up) this is a must have."
1.0,"My son just received this.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it is a good hard plastic.  Other than that... it was broken out of the box.  There is a warning in the box that if you manually open the visor it will cause the button to stop working.  Well, ours never worked.  The helmet is HUGE.  The manufacturer suggests adding padding to make it fit.  For a $50 toy, which is very large for the recommended ages, it could have come with a little padding like bike helmets do.
Now my son is throwing a fit that we are returning his new toy.  Thanks..."

5.0,The astronaut helmet is really nice. We got it for my grandson for his birthday. He loves that it looks like a real astronaut helmet. He got the spacesuit also. They look so realistic.
5.0,"My friend and I found a broken one of these at a thrift store for $2. By broken, I mean nothing happened when you pressed any buttons. We were going to a paint party rave that night and were amazed at the costume piece we had found. The helmet was a huge hit at the party. Everyone wanted to wear it. At the end of the night, the owner of the club took it because it was so cool. Which means we no longer had a helmet. I just bought two more for a paint party this weekend. Hopefully no one takes them, because this is getting expensive. The point of this story is that this thing fits adults, is fun, and is enjoyable even if broken. The visor opens to allow you to breathe more easily, which is great. Buy this."
5.0,"We purchased this item to go along with an Astronaut Suit our son wears. He has gone as far as wearing it to school, to his friends house, and had his mom not stopped him, he would have worn it to church! Accompanied by a Jumpsuit, gloves, backpack and boots (all sold seperately), this Helmet really awakens a childs imagination. The visor opens/closes for realistic play, and the microphone and sound effects only add to the experience. My sons interest in space and exploring the universe has increased since the purchase, and I have no doubt the item only enhanced his interest.

A recommended item for any child who wishes to explore the galaxy!"
1.0,"My son loves astronauts--so, we got this helmet to go along with his astronaut costume.  Within a month it had split in the middle and was unable to be fixed.  Disappointing considering the cost."
3.0,"My 3 1/2 year old son is enjoying this but it is HUGE.  It easily fits my husband and myself.  Also, the visor pops off easily but you can reattach it without a problem.  I just can't get over how enormous it is."
3.0,"This looks really neat but the quality feels cheap.  It's HUGE on the head, a little loose even for an adult, so it doesn't fit any of the kids, and when it flops down it is kindof jarring so it's hard to play with.  Instructions suggest purchasing and adding some foam inserts to make it fit better, and we probably will, but it's a little disappointing.  Looks neat, little cheap, and packaging was kind of cheap, too (we presented it out of the box).  Kids seem excited to see it, but don't leave it on long.  Sounds are just OK."
5.0,"This is an excellent helmet for any kid who likes to play astronaut or wants to dress as one.  It has sounds and a play mic plus the face shield opens and closes.  While the US isn't doing shuttle missions anymore that doesn't mean kids can't dress up and dream of their ideal career!  This helmet is great along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aeromax-Jr-Astronaut-Suit-with-Embroidered-Cap-White-size-6-8/dp/B000FGKC2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aeromax Jr. Astronaut Suit with Embroidered Cap, White, size 6/8</a>&nbsp;for a costume."
5.0,It's large enough and durable enough to be able to last a few years! My boys play with it daily and it is holding up just fine.
1.0,"awful toy, didn't work and was so big it was even too big for
 my husband. Don't buy it, I returned it, but wasted 18 dollars on shipping!"
5.0,"Great accessory for the astronaut costume, but I know that this will be played with long after the astronaut costume no longer fits.  The visor flips up making this even more fun!"
1.0,"This helmet is advertised for children, it does not fit a child and is instead sized for an adult.  The helmet rests on the 3 year-old's shoulders and wobbles around.  The Microphone is made of cheap plastic and snapped off within a few minutes of use."
3.0,"I bought this to complete a Halloween costume for my 6 year old son. Believe the other reviewers when they say it is huge. There is no way he could safely wear this at a Halloween party or running around trick-or-treating - he can barely walk in the house without bumping into something while wearing it. On the flip side, he does love it and feels like a real astronaut while wearing it so perhaps it will get some make-believe play use. I do have a problem with the price though. The quality of the piece appears to more in the $15-20 range than the $40 range."
3.0,"The helmet, though really needed to complete the costume, is very large for a child's head.  I can wear it.  However, if it were smaller it would have been too difficult for kids to get off and on. I think if you just padded the inside, which I will try, they will get it on and off just as easy but also wear it more comfortably.  Maybe the company could include such an offer since the helmet is already very pricey."
2.0,It is not worth the money... Sound is muffled through a cheap speaker. The visor is cheap and falls off easy. Wouldnt buy it again.... Diffently cheap! Not worth it!
3.0,Got it for my 5 years old son. It's functioning OK but it's size is HUGE and make is cumbersome.
2.0,"My grandson was so excited to get this.  We unpacked it and read the directions.  My husband checked out the mechanics and checked the button to hear the talking from space control and that worked.  Then he checked the button which controls the visor to go up and down.  It went up but not down now its stuck.  He opened the battery compartment and moved the batteries around but still nothing.....we are very disappointed.  We will try to get new batteries.  We can't return because my 5 yr old grandson, in his excitement to receive, smashed the empty box up.  I wouldn't recommend this item."
2.0,"This helmet is durable, but is too heavy and large for a child to enjoy.  I would think that most children put it in their room on display...since they must enjoy space related items.  Don't purchase this helmet if your child wants to run around and pretend to be an astronaut......."
4.0,Grandson did a presentation on Indiana native Dr. David Wolf.  The helmet was used in the talk and related to Dr. Wolf's space walks.
5.0,"My fiance and I knew that my little cousin Jack (almost age 4) was into space and decided to get him something little more unique for Christmas. When he took it out of the box, everyone thought he was going to be scared of it and wouldn't want to play with it. Boy were they absolutely wrong. He couldn't let it out of his sight. He looked so cute putting it on and popping open the visor ... lol ... this lasted at least 7 days. I'm sure his parents didn't appreciate having to take it back on their plane ride home after the holidays but they were definitely proud of him when he wasn't scared to play with it and I know they loved to see their son's creativity outlet through his imagination the way it did. I highly recommend this for young boys who have expressed an interest in space/the moon/etc. Great gift."
5.0,"I am a professional space adventurer and can positively say that this product cannot be used in actual space expiration.  That being said, I am however in a space rock group. I bought this product for my band's super space jams.  The visor is a bit dark so I am unable to see my sweet finger licks through it, but it's cool because I can play with it up. If I would have designed this helmet, it would have a voice modulator and walkie-talkies...and then i would buy 5 and give them to all of my space friends."
4.0,"I purchased this helmet for my 9 year old son.  He picked it out on Amazon last summer but I was reluctant since I was afraid his head would be too big for it, since the recommended age was younger than he was.  When I finally did buy it, I was pleasantly surprised since it fits him with room to grow.  And he is a good-sized boy (not a small head).  It does instruct the owner to not open the front flap manually--to only use the button located on the side.  As long as the child will remember that the helmet should last for lots of play time.  Fun sound affects too!!  He loves it!!  It matches the astronaut suit, boots, and backpack perfectly; of which he wears all the time!!"
4.0,Love the helmet but it is huge!  Big enough to fit a male adult!
4.0,"It is so big. My kid loved it. Not wealth the money consider only for one use. Maybe I'll be an astronaut next Halloween, and after that."
4.0,"My 4- and 2-yr old boys both love to play Astronauts.  They gear up in their costumes and pretend to drive spaceships!  They were so excited about these helmets that they wore them for a good part of Christmas Day, and several times after.  The visor/shield goes up and down making it seem ""real"".  There are also sounds that play in the headset, but my kids were most thrilled with the working visor/shield.  The only drawbacks are that the helmet is generously sized...so quite big on children under 5.  Also, the box says to only open the visor with the button - but young kids instinctively want to push it up with their hands.  Although the instructions clearly say this will cause the visor to malfunction - ours hasn't broken yet (and it has been opened by hand more than once already).  We got ours on a special for $18."
3.0,"The helmet really completes the outfit but I was kinda disappointed. I thought that it would change your voice when you talked but it doesn't. Also the visor keeps falling off. But overall, he enjoys it. I got a really good deal on this through Amazon and it serves its purpose as a play toy."
4.0,"My boys, now three and five, have been playing with this helmet for years: it's great for pretend play.  If you have a child with a vivid imagination who does not need a lot of battery-operated  noise to have fun, then this helmet is for you.  Assuming your kids are not deliberately destructive, then perhaps you'll find as we did that the helmet visor will be irreparably broken after 1 1/2-2 years.  The helmet is well worth the normal price of +/- $45 and is a screaming deal at $19,95: I just bought two!"
5.0,"WOW, what a realistic astronaut helmet. We purchased this helmet to go with our son's astronaut costume.  It was awesome!  He got so many compliments!  He really felt like he was a true astronaut. A dream come true for a day...priceless."
2.0,"This helmet is huge. You could have a head as big as Andre the Giant and still fit into this helmet. It makes my son (5.5 yrs, normal size) look like a bobble head. It is so big and clunky that he takes if off after half a minute. He does not play with it at all. We bought it for a Halloween costume (with the white astronaut suit) and the suit is really cute and realistic, but this helmet is definitely not. You can't even hear the sounds unless you are wearing the helmet, so the blastoff can only be enjoyed by the wearer. And that is the only sound, just a countdown and blastoff. No mission control stuff and anything else. Plus the flipping visor comes off a lot. My son has a great imagination and had more fun with a helmet we made from a box (before we bought the helmet) than he did with this helmet. Wish I hadn't bought it, but could not return it after I had opened it."
2.0,"My son has really been wanting this, and he says he's OK with it, but it's been sitting on the shelf since he got it. The mike broke off when he tried to rotate it. It's on a thing that looks like it should rotate, but it doesn't, so now there's no mike.

The whole thing is big, clumsy and just not designed with kids in mind."
5.0,"We gave this to our budding astronaut for his 5th birthday - and he was ""over the moon"" pardon the pun!
He absolutely LOVES this helmet!
The price we bought it for, could not even be beat on EBay!
It completed his astronaut costume perfectly and now he feels like he is on ""real"" missions.
Highly recommend this product. Be careful not to let it hit the floor too much - it seems as though it could break if handeled TOO roughly.

Perfect for both boys and girls."
1.0,We used 3 of these helmets for a theatrical production pertaining to a space flight.  They were great!
4.0,Love the concept. Would be better if the visor were able to be opened and closed manually although the product label warns that manual manipulation will damage the mechanism.
2.0,"I bought this for my 5 year old son and it was way too big for him. In fact, it was a little big on me. I was expecting more out of the helmet and was disappointed that the noise it did make was muffled and hard to hear. I would not recommend this for children."
5.0,"This was purchased for a 7 year olds school project and show. He loves it. The recording is realistic and adds to the pretend play. The hinge on the face mask should only be opened with a button, so I'm apprehensive about that breaking. We're tring to make it last until Halloween."
1.0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jr-Astronaut-Helmet-with-sounds/dp/B0008F6WMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jr. Astronaut Helmet with sounds</a>The face shield would not stay closed right after I got it out of the box, and I did not try to open the face shield manually...as the warning in the box says that will break it. It was already broken. Of course, this is a foolish design anyway for child use, as a child will forget and try to open it manually. It's bound to break soon ..as you can see by other reviews, this has happened to several. And the replacement batteries are not normal batteries, nor are they located where the illustration says on the box. I don't know if replacing the batteries will help the face shield work...haven't gotten to a Radio Shack yet to find the specialty batteries. Very disappointing! Haven't even given to the kids yet. I wish I had read all the other reviews before buying. Since I also bought the space suit, I'm not sure what to do with the broken helmet. Expensive to ship back."
4.0,"My son has the outfit, so it wasn't complete until we got him the helmet. He loves it. one of his favorites."
4.0,My 4 year old son loves this helmet. It has a visor that comes down and opens and also a headset which has a recording. The only thing is my two year old got a hold of it and took out the padding inside the helmet. Made for maybe 3 and up.
3.0,"We bought this for our 4yo son, who is a bit hard on his toys.  In less than 2 weeks (more like 2 days) he has broken the mechanism that automatically opens the visor.  He loves the buttons, sounds, and overall he likes the helmet, but for a 4yo it is a bit big/bulky for his body.  He does like it, but it is not his first toy of choice, nor even his first costume/dress up piece.  He says it is good, and when he's wearing it he enjoys flying around the house.  Bang for the buck, maybe not at four, but it is a good fun item."
5.0,Great durable helmet....perfect with NASA suit. Helmet is large enough for adult head to fit in but comfortable for a 5 year old! Very cool!
3.0,"My nephew absolutely loved this helmet!  However, his parents and I were quite disappointed when he went to reach for the microphone and shield and both broke off pretty easile right out of the box......I think SuperGlue may have helped but we're still disappointed with the durability."
2.0,"The 3 year old who recieved this gift absolutely loved it but it was enormous!  It comfortably fit my husband's head!  We were prepared to deal with that by adding weather stripping as indicated in the box.  But, the visor broke 30 minutes after he (the 3 year old) began wearing it - and he was not being particualrly rough with it either.  If you're going to market something for children, it should fit a child and be sturdy enough to last more than 30 minutes.  It's such a great idea and compliment to the astronaut suit, and he did go crazy over it, but for the price, I am dissapointed in the quality of the construction."
4.0,"My kids have a blast with this helmet but I'm surprised it was so expensive, I also thought it would make more sounds and have more features than it does.  It is also pretty big and heavy and can fit an adult's head.  Overall not worth it for the price."
5.0,"My daughter wore this helmet with her Halloween costume.  It is large and we had to add some padding to the inside so it didn't move around so much, but it was a great addition to her costume!  Very realistic and lots of fun!!!"
2.0,"Perfect for the crowning of two king's, but you get what you pay for. It was not of the highest quality."
5.0,Perfect.
4.0,This Ralph Lauren tuxedo fits well. Nice material. Good quality for the price.
3.0,"like most all Ralph Lauren, it runs small"
5.0,I have used this hat twice now and I can already tell it it going to be my go-to hat for the spring and summer. I got the 24 month size for my 8 month old (she has a big head..over 40cm around) and I read the reviews stating to get a bigger size. It fits her head perfectly with some room to grow. She loves chewing on the strings. It's soft and comfy. Totally recommend all Zutano products. I just wish the various colors weren't always sold out.
5.0,"Bought two of these for 7 month old twins.  They are a little bit large on the girls but they'll grow into them.  The tie keeps the hat in place, hat washes beautifully, and definitely keeps the sun out of their eyes."
5.0,This hat is absolutely adorable on and the strings are great because you can tie it as loosely or tightly as needed for your little one.
5.0,"This sun hat is very cute and very well made.  My daughter started wearing it at 3 months, there is much room for her to grow in it.  Provide good sun protection for her little face."
5.0,"I use this for my daughter and there is enough brim to help keep out the sun, and it fits well. I don't worry about fastening the chin strap, I just pull it on her head and it stays put more or less. I love the color and stripes - not too girly, but very cute. I've gotten lots of compliments."
4.0,"This is the hat I used all summer! When my baby was awake, I put this hat on which shaded her eyes but she could still see. It is soft but the brim is firm enough to hold it's shape. It doesn't offer coverage over the entire face but I have another hat for that (but she cant see)."
5.0,"I love this hat. It is very lightweight with sides wide enough to protect baby's face if left down or folded up if he wanted to observe his surroundings. The fact that is is a pure cotton was my reason to chose this model and I am glad I did - pretty color, light, thin (but not flimsy or cheap looking). Great product!!!"
5.0,Love it
5.0,very easy to put on baby and it seems comfortable
5.0,Perfect hat!  It stays on well with or without tying and has nice coverage from the sun.
4.0,"This is a really nice little hat, but much too big for my 2 month old. It was labeled as 0-6 months but I don't see how it would possibly fit a little one under 3 months. It should be nice once it fits, but it may no longer be the right season."
3.0,"My babies are big for their age, I have a 3 month old who wear 6-9month clothes and her head is on the large size plus I wanted it to fit through the summer so I ordered the 12 month size and its a little big but that's okay. What's more important than fit is color, I ordered the ""lime"" not looking at the name, but the picture looks like a light cute yellow but when it came it was obviously green, which wasn't what I expected but it was still cute so I kept it. But just be warned that the picture doesn't give a very accurate portrayal of the color. Otherwise I like how soft it is and how long the strings are to tie it."
5.0,Only hat that actually fits my newborn perfectly!
4.0,"Great fitting quality hat. Like most mentioned, the tying of the string is a little in the way."
5.0,really cute
5.0,6mo fits my 3mo perfectly. His head is in 97th percentile tho!! Nice cotton that washes easily. I liked it too because it's a
5.0,This cute sun hat is a perfect fit for my daughter. The material is soft and the hat is well made.
5.0,"Absolutely love this hat. It is super soft, lightweight, and a wonderful neutral color that would be adorable on both boys and girls. I love that the brim is a bit thicker and can mold to the position you want it. Keeps the sun out of my daughter's face beautifully. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Cute, fits well, washes well!"
3.0,"Cute and serves its purpose, but the ties are a problem. Would prefer a Velcro closure.."
5.0,So cute! Fits my 1 year old very well.
5.0,"This hat looked more yellow in the photo but it was lime green for sure, really cute and fits as expected. Well made, nice material."
5.0,"Very nice looking hat. Cotton inside/outside and thin, perfect for the summer."
3.0,"The material is very soft and cute, but does not have great coverage of baby's face. It still fits my eleven pound, very petite four month old baby. This is for small babies."
4.0,Great hat.  Soft material and protects well from sun.  The downside is that the strings must be tied (no velcro or other easy mechanism to close).
5.0,Have always loved the Zutano sun hats!  This is my DD's 4th or 5th one.  They are super soft and provide excellent face coverage in the sun.  :)
4.0,I love this hat! I bought one for my newborn daughter to keep the summer sun off of her brand new skin. It does a great job on doing that. Its also very durable. Wash resistant.
2.0,Hat size was too small.  The brim doesn't provide enough shade for baby's face.
4.0,So nice and soft..
5.0,Keeps the sun out of our little ones gave and looks very cute. Fits her perfectly at 4 months
5.0,Cute sun hat.  Perfect for baby's day at the beach or pool.
3.0,It shrunk when I washed it so it fits my 4/5 month. I don't think I see her using it past 6 months. The material was nice and the straps worked well.
5.0,Fits my 8 month old perfect. She loves it and it looks adorable on her.
4.0,This is the only hat my daughter has will keep on. It's super soft and seems to be very breathable.
4.0,Same as picture
5.0,Great hat for the money. I do agree with other reviewers that it does run small. I ordered 12month. My daughter is 10 months and it fit perfectly but likely won't work for us all summer.
5.0,Just what the grandchild needed for the bright sunny days.
5.0,Size 12 month fits my 9 month old well with room to grow. Looks adorable on her.
5.0,Bought the 6-12 moth size for my 5 month old son. It will be great for the summer! So glad it's made of soft cotton!
5.0,awesome!!!
5.0,"Adorable! Soft comfortable yet firm enough to protect from sun and the baby can see the world too, just a shaded view."
5.0,Super cute and fits my nicely! I've been having issues with hats not really staying on my baby's head - but this was perfect and also a great soft breathable material - great for hot summer days so she's not sweaty wearing the hat
5.0,"Good fit, nice material, nice because brim is not huge."
4.0,Cute hat for my 5 month old. Ordered a size 12 month buts she'll grow into it. I can flip the front up so she can see better and have the back of her neck still covered. String nice to tie or not. She loves to play with it.
5.0,Great hat! Fits well fast delivery:)
5.0,Such a cute summer hat!
5.0,Very soft and lots of coverage!
5.0,So cute! Nice fabric.
5.0,Fits geat and looks great on my 4m/o baby.
5.0,Excelent
5.0,Wonderful hat! I need a few more colors. I bought the 12 month size for my 4 month old daughter and it fits nicely with room to grow. Shades her eyes and flips up well if I want it too. She was very happy to wear it all day when we went to the beach. Wish I could insert a picture so you could see for yourself. I added pictures from oct 2014 and then more recent ones with the other colors.
5.0,"This was so cute, perfect for my newborn daughter.  She loves walks and we needed something to shield her eyes.  She looked so adorable, I was sad when she outgrew it."
5.0,This is so well made and it looks great on my baby. It is soft and offers great sun protection for little ones. I probably have to buy a bigger size already.
4.0,"Bought this hat for my daughter. It's light. At high noon, I'd say it blocks the sun from the top two-thirds of her face. She looks extremely cute in it and it fits her 3 month old head very well."
5.0,"It is really good sun hat. Fits perfectly even it's little big for my daughter (I've bought size 6-12 month for 4 month old). Excellent breathable fabric, convenient chin ties."
4.0,Would give this pretty little hat a five star if not for the tie...wish it had velcro instead...2month old baby hates it tied but is ok with the hat in general.
5.0,I love how this brand offered various sizing for babies.  This fit perfectly on my 3 month old.  We will be using this often.
5.0,"We've used Zutano hats from age 3 months to 18 months. I wish that they had it in even larger sizes, so we could stick with it as our daughter grows up. We live on the beach, so this gets used every day! Holds up to baby, sand, surf and washing."
5.0,"Love these hats! Brim is the perfect size, keeps the sun off of my daughter's face. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,"This is too cute!  Not too heavy to wear in the middle of the summer and has great coverage - kept my daughter's face and neck completely shielded.  It must be comfortable too, because she doesn't pull it off as she does with most other hats."
4.0,"My 15 month baby has a small head and the 18 month size is a little big on her, which is to be expected.  It is very cute- white with thin white and bubblegum pink stripes in the hot pink color.  It has a decent brim, maybe a little too floppy.  I can't get her to keep it on but hopefully eventually I'll win this battle!"
5.0,"I purchased this for granddaughter to protect her when out of doors. It looks sweet, fits well.  I am we'll pleased with this purchase."
5.0,I bought this item after reading reviews which also said to be careful about sizing. So I measured my baby's head and ordered it based based on that. So my 8 mo old baby is wearing a hat for 18m. It doesn't matter but be careful.
5.0,"My daughter is in 90th percentile. I ordered the largest size and it just fits so I would recommend ordering a little bit. I love the material, I love the pattern, I love the tie. It's a great product"
5.0,"Loved this little sun hat for our first trip to the beach with our baby girl! True to size , soft , and stylish !"
2.0,My daughter is 4 months old and has an average size head.  This hat is far too large for her.  She might fit into once the summer is over but that would defeat its purpose.
5.0,My daughter is 13 months old but is the size of an 18-month old and the 24-month fits her with room to grow (her head size was 18.5 inches at her one year appt).  She hates the strings and won't let me tie them around her face so I just tied and tucked them behind her head.  Otherwise it is perfect!
5.0,"Like most ""tall"" people, I hesitate buying pants online, in any form. But I figured, since these are just for working out, what's the difference. I was pleasantly suprised when these pants arrived. They were actually long enough for me...I'm 5'll"" and the medium was just right, even in the length. I also loved how super stretchy they are."
5.0,This is absolutely the most comfortable pair of pants that I've ever worn.  The extra bit of spandex (10% as opposed to most pants' 5%) allows the maximum movement without losing the shape of the pants.  These pants are so great that I just bought another pair for myself and highly recommend them to other women.
1.0,"When I received my ring, it was very apparent that it was made incorrectly. There was a huge gap between the diamond and the setting but only on one side. I contacted customer service to see if this could be repaired and was told that since it was a purchase over $300.00, I could only get a refund. I advised them I would be overnighting the ring back and would wait for my refund. After 7 days of waiting for my money, I received a ""repaired ring"" which ended up looking just as bad as the first one. It was the original ring that someone had poorly attempted to close the gap on the band. Not only was there still a gap, but now one side of the ring sat higher than the other. I immediately called customer service because I did not ask for another ring to be sent and explained that I had been waiting for a refund. The rep that I spoke to said he didn't see any documentation of a new ring being shipped or the old one being repaired. He told me that he would call me first thing the next morning after speaking to some of his colleagues to get this resolved. I waited 2 days and still had not heard anything so I called again. I spoke to a different rep who assured me I would have my refund the next day. I told her that I had already been waiting almost two weeks for this refund. She said she would put a rush on it but that never happened. I never did hear back from the 2 reps that I spoke with as they both promised to call me with an update. After waiting over 3 weeks I finally received my refund. My experience with Amazon was horrible. Not only was the product poorly constructed but the customer service department was no help at all. They made several promises that they did not keep and never made an attempt to keep me informed with the status of my issue. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to read this...
M. Ebel"
5.0,"My girlfriend was to say in the least very happy and excited to get the ring. Quite a few people were skeptical that I bought my ring from Amazon, but after a jeweler's appraisal all skepticism was satisfied. Jeweler appraised about 40% higher than what I paid."
5.0,"Dealing with jewlery salespeople is like dealing with car dealers.... misearble.  Using Amazon to buy the engagement ring was the best decision I could have made.  Such an easy process, such a great price, and the customer service was superb.  There was a slight delay in delivery (one day) and I had an email letting me know to expect the delay, and a refund of $70 for the inconvience.  The ring showed up looking exactly like I thought it would, my fiance loved it, as has everyone she has shown.  I would recommend getting your ring on Amazon to anyone I know."
3.0,"I whish Amazon would pay more attention to details, when a customer pays $6K for a product. Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.

The bad and very bad:

1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.

2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.

3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K

4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...

5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!

6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.

7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.

The good:

1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.

2. Automated diamond search system is very good.

3. Looks like the craftsmanship is good."

5.0,These will be perfect. It won't draw attention away. My mom has to be careful what she wears as not to distract customers & these are perfect. I loved them.
5.0,I purchased the pendent...and loved it alot...so I had to get the earrings also...very very nice...I would recommend this jewerly to anyone..
5.0,gave a pair to daughter and one for me love love love them and we both needed the right studs these are them
5.0,"i loved these earings  i bought them for my mom in law for christmas and i was very happy... they were a great size, not too large but not too small that you couldn't see the design all in all i would buy this item again... the necklace that matched was also very well designed and the stones are set very well im not afraid of her losing the turqoise out of it."
5.0,"As advertised...quickly delivered and they look the same ""in person"" as they do in the photo. Attractive and well-made."
5.0,"My son loves these boots (he's 5). He thinks they're cool because they are snake skin (not real snake skin I'm sure, but he thinks they are). They seem to fit well and are apparently comfortable because he asks to wear them a lot, even with wind pants. He doesn't understand why cowboy boots just don't go with wind pants, or shorts, or anything but jeans."
5.0,bought for my son.....the fit is great and the boot is very well made...he absolutely loves these boots and wears them all the time.
2.0,"My son wore these for my nephew's wedding and at the end of the night he scuffed the paint right off the snake skin area. I didn't
realize they painted them to look like snake skin, I would not recommend these for a little boy at all!"
5.0,"Okay, so my son LOVES these boots!  He slept with them on his feet the first night he had them.  They are darling.  I have no idea how ""authentic"" they are but they are the real deal as far as I can tell. Sure, they cost a bit more than a Target or KMart store but totally worth it!"
4.0,"My daughter asked for these for christmas. They are made well and fit her great! They didn't scuff up that easily and I was thankful for that. The metal bracket that resides at the base of the toe came loose after a couple of months, but other than that, the boot held up beautifully! In fact, when she outgrew these she asked for another pair just like them!"
3.0,The boot is cute but it is very narrow and too stiff to move and get a toddler's foot inside. Item is being returned.
5.0,My grandson is enjoying his boots. He ca wear them anytime but they aso add fun to dress up time with his couins.
5.0,"This is a definite buy!  I got these super fast!  Just two days after ordering them!  They look exactly like the picture.  I ordered a pair for my six year old and got them about a size too big.  He wears an extra pair of socks with them and they fit great.  Great buy, great look, great product!"
4.0,"Although I though they seemed a bit stiff and imitation, by son asked me to buy a second pair when his first became too small.  He's 10, and we had tried on other boots that were much more expensive.  I do think that a better brand would give you more comfort for everyday use, but he is quite content with these and wears them a couple of times a week.  Can't ask for more than to keep them happy!"
5.0,"This is the second pair of the same boots as my granddaughter grows up. We both are very happy - they look great, last long without loosing good look and are comfortable enough."
5.0,nice boots item came quick as expected and was in a designer box
5.0,Great cowboy boots for a kid... Cheap and look and feel like the real deal! Went great with his suit for a wedding!
5.0,My 5 year old love these!
5.0,So so cute. Well made little boy boot and flashy too.
4.0,"These run a bit big but they look awesome!  I would have given 5 stars but the inside of the boots is a bit uncomfortable for my 5yr old to wear without tall socks and the bottoms are SLICK!  He fell several times on the hard floor because of the slickness of the sole.  I think it'll be OK after we scuff them up but for the price, I would have thought they would have been a bit better."
5.0,"They're for my 7 year old grandson, he loves them.

UPDATE: He's had them 8 months now, he still loves them and he wears them everywhere, moreover, after a little ageing, they take on more of a look of real snakeskin."
5.0,My grandson loves these...he slept in them the first night (like a good cowboy...)
5.0,My Grandson got lots of compliments on his boots!!! He loves them!!!
5.0,My son loved the boots and they looked great for the HLSR!
5.0,"My grandson loved these shoes, drove his parents crazy as they have wood floors!"
5.0,my son loves them!
5.0,My Grandson loves these boots and they fit perfect.
5.0,My 6 y.o. son wears them just about every other day. He loves them and never complains about his feet hurting. They still look good after 6 months of hard wear.
4.0,Bought these boots as a replacement for a brand new pair purchased from Amazon. First pair (different brand) came apart after two hours of my son wearing them. This pair from Durango seem to be holding up ok. I wish I could remember the name of the other brand to warn customers. Sorry.
5.0,Amazing quality!! Great buy!
1.0,If you are attempting to purchase a Big Kids 6.5 boot the site will allow you to select this size but you will receive a toddler boot.
4.0,"Great boots, they were just a little snug for a 9. My son usually wears an 8 but we wanted room for socks and growth. We had a hard time getting them on & he did wear them for a few hours."
5.0,Great boot. No issues with seller.
5.0,We bought these for my son and he absolutely loves them. He wears them everywhere.
5.0, my son loves these.
5.0,My grandson loved them
4.0,My son loves these. They fit pretty good maybe a tiny bit large but better to big than to small.
5.0,grandson loves them
5.0,My son LOVES his new boots!!! They are awesome.
5.0,Love them!
4.0,Got these for my son.. He absolutely loves them and takes pride in wearing them.
4.0,Both ny grandsons were thrilled
5.0,As asvertised. Fast shipping.
4.0,I bought it a little large for toe space.  2.5 When my 7 yo son tried it on he said it hurt because inside the seams were a little rough rubbing against his leg when he walked. He said long socks helps and wearing the jeans inside the boots helped. He loved it because the snake skin look.
5.0,I reviewed this based on my son's answers.  It's go Texan day tomorrow and he needed new boots for Rodeo.  He is super happy and hasn't taken them off since they arrived yesterday (except to sleep).  I say these are a winner.
5.0,my grandson loved them
4.0,My grandson won't take them off. He loves them. He will be going to a bull riding show next week and will be sporting his new boots
5.0,Bought these for my Grandson for his birthday and he loved them.
1.0,"These are not big kids, they are 6.5 toddler."
5.0,good boots for kids but too small.  Easy return for correct larger size.
5.0,This is our third pair of Durango boots - only because our son outgrows them and just plain wears them out because he loves them so much.  He wears them daily.  They are great boots - look great and fit great.  We bought our other son the same boots because they both just loved them so much.  Highly recommend!
5.0,My grandson loved them
3.0,Boots shipped out great and got here earlier than expected. They look exactly like the picture. However the first pair we received my 4 year old son wore them for less than 10 minutes and the snake skin part was already peeling off. However the company was very quick to ship us a replacement pair my son is just afraid to act himself in the boots for fear they will mess up again.
2.0,sent wrong size but they are really cute
5.0,Beautiful boots.  Perfect fit!
5.0,This was the shizzle for a good long while.  My kid was the coolest in AC for a year.
5.0,"Ordered 7 big kid, received 7 toddler. Boots were adorable tho. Exchanged for men's 7 in another style (7 big kid is not actually an option even though it's listed). Exchange process was VERY SIMPLE, but price was double."
5.0,My 3 year old son LOVEs his boots.  so many compliments.  only thing I would change is to add rubber to the bottom of soul. Because they are so loud running on hardwood floors. And they hurt when he kicks ( :
4.0,"These boots arrived today and they are gorgeous.  Unfortunately, I have to send them back tomorrow.  I ordered a 10 1/2 (toddler), and they are not any bigger than the 9 and a half he just outgrew.  When we measured the soles, these boots were the same length as his old ones, and the pointed toe makes them even smaller (his old boots were square toe)...  I'd recommend ordering at least one full size larger.  On a good note, the boots seem to be a well made, solid boot and they look even better in person!  For that reason, I give them 4 stars."
5.0,My son has had these boots twice now. He picked them out himself when he was 4 and at 6 he wanted another pair. They held up great the first time around.
5.0,Great boots and amazing quality. my boys jaw dropped when he saw them. a little on the pricey side but for 20 less your not getting anywhere near this quality.
5.0,I ordered these for my grandson's birthday and as soon as he opened the box he was thrilled! The boots fit true to size. I would recommend!
1.0,Very disappointed. The sole of the shoe is a hard plastic and very slippery and the boot itself has no give. They will be returned.
5.0,Great value! My grandson loved them for his 4th birthday. He shows them off and wants to where them everwhere.
5.0,"We received the boots on the date expected, which was a few days before Christmas. My son has been wearing them and absolutely loves them. They are very good quality and look great."
5.0,"I love these socks. They fit great and are really padded. A bit pricey, but so far worth it. They stay up (don't fall into the shoe like some of these types of socks) and are really absorbent."
2.0,This boot is cute but is about 2 sizes too large. I purchased size 2 for my 9 months old because I did read in the reviews that they ran big (she's currently between a 2 and 3) but they were still too big!
1.0,I love the way these look... but my baby wore them two times and the string broke on both shoes.  My husband did it on the first one and I yelled at him saying he pulled too hard and I went to tie the second shoe and the lace completely ripped off.  What a waste of money!!!  I do not even know who to contact on here to discuss a replacement or return.
2.0,"Sad to say these were way too large for my newborn! (These should be able to fit her by this Christmas, not Christmas in 2 years) They were almost big enough to fit on my 2 year old's size 7T foot! The quality is wonderful, the design is adorable, & the style is too cute. Luckily, I can exchange, so I'm hoping the size 1M will fit more on par with what a 3M!"
4.0,So adorable but runs big.  I bought a size 3 for my six month old.  My daughter kicks them off frequently.
5.0,Loved to booties! Purchased for our new baby due next month! The size 2 that I got- will probably have to be for next year! I will have to buy the size 1 for when baby arrives!
5.0,So cute and comfy. Fits perfect.
3.0,"Well, I ordered a three and my child didn't get to fit them well until she got into a 5 or 6. The tie doesn't stay kept for long, my child easily comes out them. I love the texture and the authentic look but I don't like how the tongue easily comes out of the tie, which makes it hard for my baby to keep them on and walk."
5.0,"I read all of the reviews before purchasing these shoes! I bought a size 1 for my 9 month old. They are big and she will be able to wear them until she is a year or older. Since these shoes have a tie, the fact that they are big really isn't a problem. I am able to secure them well and they don't look huge. These shoes are very nice and well made. I actually still have the same exact shoe from when I was a baby! They held up very well and are a classic style! The straps are real leather so obviously they will snap if you pull them too hard. My 35 year old shoes made it through 3 babies so far and didn't tear. They are the next size up and my daughter will be wearing them after these new ones!!"
5.0,I purchased this in 2-3 toddler size which is her shoe size but they were extremely big when I received them. It's okay though be issue that only means my believe would have to wait a bit longer but the shoes are totally cute
3.0,"Cute Mocs, but they don't really stay on. They tend to run on the larger siZe too."
1.0,These are so cute but very hard to get baby foot into and then the tie snapped off on both shoes the first time I was trying to tie them onto my baby. Terrible quality.
5.0,soft and comfy
2.0,It's weird on my daughters foot
4.0,They run large.
5.0,"Although I love these, they run a bit large! My niece is in a 2 now and I bought a 2 but she can def grow into them!"
5.0,They do run a bit big but I think they're better big than small. They are very sturdy and look great! My baby is 5 months old and I ordered a size one. She has about an inch to spare but they don't fall off if secured correctly.
3.0,Ordered the smallest size for a new grand baby coming in May 2016. Runs very large....but the baby will wear them eventually. Not too disappointed. They're cute!
5.0,"As stated in a previous review, they run a size larger.  I therefore kept that in mind when ordering and they fit my baby perfectly!"
3.0,"I am giving them 3 stars because they are adorable.. But only if you baby isn't walking. I would recommend these if you wanted to use them in a photo shoot and that is all. My 9 month old is just starting to walk on his own. He has super wide feet and we have struggled to find shoes his feet fit in. We have a size smaller than his usual size and they are still falling off his feet. The way they are designed makes no sense. The tie is too high on his foot, and the tongue slips down. Within a few steps they are already off his feet... They are exceptionally well constructed though... Wish they were better because they are ridiculously cute."
3.0,Way too big
5.0,"They are giant...really giant. But so adorable, so I don't mind waiting for the babe to grow into them."
1.0,Velcro backs are no good. They don't stay on. Look old after one use.
5.0,Love the boots bought a size one for my 5 month old. The boots were a bit big but that's ok because she can grow into them.
3.0,My daughter wears a size 2 almost 3. Every other shoe she has is a size 2 and they are snug. I saw that these ran big so I ordered a 2 and they are HUGE. To the point where she won't be able to wear them until next fall/winter. Their sizing makes no sense to me. Frustrating because I bought these for this season BUT the quality and style of the shoe is perfect. Just way too big.
4.0,"These moccasins are adorable but everyone was right, they definitely run large.  I took a sewing measuring tape to my son's foot to measure and it was the exact length for the size 3, but when they came in the mail and we tried them on, there was definitely almost an inch extra between his toes and the front of the shoe.  I'm not too worried about it because if he keeps growing at the rate he has been, they will probably fit in a month and he will still have plenty of wear time in them during most of the winter and early spring."
5.0,Very nice
2.0,When you tie them they don't stay on but I love how cute they are
5.0,"So adorable, great quality. I love them, my daughter looks so cute wearing them"
5.0,a little big like others have stated but they are super cute and give growing room. Found the materials to be great and the price is good as well.
5.0,a bit too big but good.
5.0,A little big but super cute!
5.0,Adorable! A little big but so cute
5.0,I am in love with these little mocs. They go great with any outfit or even just with a diaper and can be worn for long periods without becoming irritating to baby although I'm sure they must get warm because baby's feet are often a but sweaty after removing them.  When these first arrived the laces and fringes were a bit stiff but became more flexible with time and exposure to moisture. I would recommend them to anybody!
5.0,"""Squee!"""
2.0,"Don't buy and waste your money. They are cute but not worth the money. They fall off bc you can't tie them tight enough and when you try to tie them tight the shoe string breaks off. I have had these a week and the shoe lace on one has broke off so now there's hardly any hope on my daughter getting to wear them. And the reason I bought them was to wear for pictures we are getting in a couple weeks... No hope there. But of course that's my fault, should have just kept them tucked away till then."
2.0,Ordered these for my daughter and they were way too big. I decided to save them because they're so cute. Now that they actually fit her she got to wear them twice.. As I was tying one shoe the string snapped and they can no longer be tied :( they also turned her feet orange both times she did wear them and it took major scrubbing to get them clean so beware!
3.0,"Very cute and look quite well-made but they are WAY too big, as others have posted. I measure the Size 2 that I received as 5 inches long, which is way larger than their quoted size. At least she'll grow into them!"
4.0,"Adorable, but definitely looks large!"
4.0,These shoes are incredibly cute! I get compliments all the time. The laces do come undone easily and they run very large. I recommend going to the actual website to check the size chart. If you go by that you will get a perfect fit.
5.0,"My baby has yet to be born, but I bought these early because I couldn't refuse the cuteness of them."
3.0,"I bought these for my then 8 month old and wanted to love them. However, every time he wears them, he effortlessly unties them and pulls them off. He also has put the ties in his mouth and gets suede residue in his mouth and slobbery hands. They are so adorable, but the lack of functionality outweighs said adorableness. I would either recommend buying a larger size for a walker (i.e. one whom you could potentially reason with/one that will actually obey when you kindly suggest his/her bootie stays on the feet they belong to), or go with another brand. Robeez and Freshly Picked (both at Nordstrom) are made with elastic at the ankle. I would stick with those options until baby is a bit older."
3.0,Super cute but way too big for infants!
1.0,"Running large is an understatement!!! I bought these for my daughter who is now in a size infant 2. And they fit my niece who wears a 4/5. I was so upset bc I was tracking the item for her to wear with an outfit I had bought for a gathering we were going to, and clearly they didn't work because of size. Needless to say it was to late to attempt to order another size. And she ended up wearing something else with no shoes.  The shoes are cute, but the sizing is horrible. Upset mommy for sure. Boo to this vender. And I will not order from them again. Get your sizing correct for future customers!!!"
5.0,It was too big but I didn't read the reviews nor check to see the sizing so I still give them 5 stars.
3.0,"So happy that I read the reviews before purchasing.  These definitely run big !! I got a size 1 for my 7 month old and they are big on her, but I am happy that it just means they'll last longer. Beautiful booties!"
5.0,"After reading the reviews and reading that these booties ran large I ordered a size smaller than my grandson normally wears and they fit wonderfully with a  little room for growth. When we put the booties on my grandson he liked them he kept sticking them in every-ones face to see, and when we put out the booties to wear he chooses these booties each time. They are his favorite."
4.0,Cute shoes but run big
4.0,"Really like these! Great quality, comfort and matches everything!"
5.0,"they run about 1 size large. which is okay, better too big than too small. if u want them to fit now, buy 1 size down. LOVE them so much! the craftsmanship is excellent."
5.0,fast shipping. just as described. thanks
4.0,"Love these! I got my nine month old daughter them in size 3 & they are huge on her, but super cute so I am excited for them to fit her!!"
3.0,I'm a fan of Minnetonka so I'll start off be saying that...however the string snapped but that was due to my mother strong arming the string to tie the babies shoe. It's great shoe just disappointed we can't let her wear them and on top of that I know that Minnetonka doesn't use good lasting material for these shoes that make (I've been wearing Minnetonka forever and my shoes either always have a whole in them by year 2 or the soles wear out by year 3). I've learned don't frequently wear these shoes and you'll be fine lol
5.0,So cute!!!!!! Shoestring are a little difficult to keep tied. Slip on style would probably be better especially for toddlers
4.0,"Dont get me wrong i love these but wow, the sizing is waaaay off. i bought size 3 months hoping they would fit my 6 month old and they were still to big. when they did finnally fit her they really didn't stay on well. She has rather small feet so this might not be the shoe for her, saddly. We love Minnetonka in this house so we will continue to buy them just maybe not thier baby shoes.
Also kind of annoying to lace up."
5.0,great booties for your little toddler
3.0,If you want your babe to wear them right away order a size or two down.
4.0,"Very cute boots, but be careful with lace!! I ripped it and I had to sewed it back. My baby is 11months she wears size 3, but I got size 2 for her fit good."
3.0,"I bought 2 pair tan slippers in size 1. One measures 4-1/2"" and is a nice tan color. The other measures 5"" and is a mustard yellow tan. Now to try and exchange the yellow 5"" for a 4-1/2"" tan so I have 2 of the same! Wish me luck!"
5.0,Perfect for my little one. Awesome shoe!
3.0,"I'm not sure why everyone says this shoe is too big.  If you click on the size chart you will see where it indicates the appropriate size for the length of your child's foot.  My son's foot is 3"" to 3.5"" inches long so I ordered size 1.  However, he's a chubby baby with a lot of padding on the top of his foot.  The instep of the shoe is quite low and I'm unable to get the shoe on.  Not sure if anyone else has experienced this and has a suggestion."
3.0,I ordered a size one for my 4 month old because that is what she is currently wearing. These moccasins while well made are entirely too large and are no where near a size 1 infant. I'm keeping them for when she grows into them because it should only be a few months but right now they are useless because they are SOO big.
3.0,"I absolutely had to have these for my child. I receive many compliements on them and they are soooo cute however functionality rates low. The back of the shoe does not have a support ""rod"" so it slouches and easily comes off their foot. If your little one is like mine they can easily untie these which then even makes it worse for them coming off. I think the ones that have the three tier of fringe and zip up may be better than the tie bootie. They are very very cute though. OH, and they run HUGE. my little one usually would take a 4 or 5 and took a 2 in these. I had a 3 and had to return it- super easy ret and shipped the new one out in the same day."
4.0,Incredibly cute but they run big.  I would recommend ordering one size smaller than you normally would.
5.0,But I love them!
5.0,So cute.
2.0,Cut small and narrow across the front of the shoe.
5.0,Love this bootie! Easy on/off. Runs a bit large but nothing too crazy. Great deal and adorable.
4.0,These are adorable. They run super big (I read all the reviews ahead of time so I sized down) they're still pretty big for a size 2 but my baby will eventually grow into them.
4.0,"Runs very large and the laces can snap if pulled too tight, (my husband has broken each pair we've owned) that being said they are so adorable and I love them!  They're well made but the tie laces are not the best and you'll need to double knot and most likely adjust because they will untie.  They sell a velcro variation that would probably work better, which I'm buying the next size up in.  As for sizing, my daughter is wearing a 5 or 6 in most shoes and the size 4 in these still fit her."
4.0,"Really cute, but much much larger than a standard size 1."
5.0,"They are really nice bootie. My daughter loved them for her new daughter (my granddaughter ). They are too big for now but she'll grow into them.
Very nice product!!!!"
3.0,Extremely too large
1.0,"I ordered a size 1 and it was obviously mislabeled. The bootie was so large that it actually measured a size 4 according to Minnetonka measurements. After reading the rest of the reviews, I feel that this entire bunch of booties are mislabeled and I wish Amazon would sell them for what they are or sell them according to their measurements only and not their number size."
4.0,These are just adorable! But they do run way too big! Just ordered another smaller pair for my twins - keeping the larger for when they fit them! Too cute!
5.0,I was looking for a replacement to one very similar to this coin pouch for my husband.  He uses it in his front pocket for change and folding cash.  He uses a smaller bi-fold wallet for credit cards and license.  He really liked it.  The leather is soft and pouch is just the right size.
5.0,These are fabulous and I have several.  The fit my credits cards and cash and fit perfectly into my back pocket.
5.0,"I have used different versions of this same product for many years.  It is the perfect size for a little money, a few credit cards, lipstick, etc., yet it is small enough to fit in my pocket.  The only reason I have had to replace it is that the zippers are nylon--I tend to overfill the pouches and tug on the zipper too hard and break them.  I have also ripped the lining in one of them.  I have been unable to find them in my local stores, so I was delighted to find an on-line source."
4.0,I got 2 of these to give as presents.  They are good quality and came promptly.
5.0,"I really enjoy this purse.  The first one I had wore out after three years and was looking for a replacement.  Luckly, I found the same purse on Amazon and bought it without hesitation.  Side zipper section holds my loose coins, and the main zipper section holds the bills.  The removable ID Card case is great when traveling and you need to carry one or two credit cards and your drivers license along; without having a bulky wallet.  Great Buy!"
4.0,"And more pewter in color than expected. We found a similar frog cuff in Albuquerque in September and lost it. I was thrilled to find this to replace the lost one, but he's smaller and doesn't seem to be as well made or detailed as the one we lost. Kind of disappointed."
5.0,This product is very cute! I purchased it as a gift & I am very happy with how fast I recieved it & the quality of the product. I would recommend.
5.0,"I gave it to a friend, and he thought it was great. I thought it might have been a little too feminine, but apparently it was not. I kind of want one for me, too."
3.0,this frog was so small and very cute but it was totally uncomfortable!! i've had others before that i lost in the years but ordering this one was a mistake!! it hurt SOOOOOO badly!! and putting it on was always hard. finally it just broke!!! don't bother.. find a different frog
2.0,I expected to recieve 2 frogs and only got 1.  What happened to the other one?  It is cute but toooooooooooooooooo little.
4.0,"Like the other reviewer, I love the shape of this cuff, but it hurts on the ear and gets caught in long hair.  I have tried it on the lobe, upper part of my ear and inside part of my ear and doesn't matter.  It's hard to get on and I'm constanly checking to make sure it's there.

Even with all that I only took one star away beucase once on it is very cute if you can handle the discomfort."
4.0,"this tiny silver frog is adorable!!

but the part that fits onto your ear is totally hard

to pry open. my fingers hurt!

ditto my ear.

but the shape is so cute that i took away just one star

tee hee:-)"
5.0,"Shipped super quick, great value for the price"
4.0,Good t shirt held up after washing just Keep it out of the drier
4.0,Everybody loves it
5.0,It's crazy when about 10 people in an airport asks you where'd you get that shirt and some old dude asked his wife to buy him one for his birthday.
5.0,Best gift.  I was pleased and got rave reviews.
5.0,One of my favorite tees.  I always get a compliment.
5.0,"I am a huge Fred Sanford fan. I loved the show and still watch it when the re-runs air. This shirt has one of Fred's signature words on it...""Champipple""! I get a lot of great comments on it whenever I wear this shirt."
5.0,Hard to find t-shirt. Glad its back in stock. Been searching for almost 3 years to find this shirt. Shirt runs true to size.
5.0,This shoe fits nicely and gives the wearer a Presidential Grace! It is easy and cool to walk with. I love it!
4.0,"The shoes are good quality, but the profile is a bit clunkier than the picture appears. That being said, construction and color is excellent."
4.0,"These are very handsome, well-made wingtips. I have recently become a big fan of Bostonian shoes, and I have always been partial to Clarks, anyway. They are quite comfortable, but do require some breaking-in. I wore them around the house for about a week before wearing them outside. They ARE stiff, but it is important to remember that wingtips are SUPPOSED to be stiff. The toe-cap and wings (longwings on these shoes) are there to make the shoe sturdier than standard oxfords. The stiffness will ease over time. These are clearly shoes that are meant to last. The leather sole gives excellent support, and the slightly padded insole makes these very comfortable walking shoes. The burgundy colour (""oxblood"") is beautiful, and the leather has a very nice finish. They run a bit small. I usually wear 8.5, though sometimes 9 with thicker walking socks. I wear a 9 in these with thin socks."
5.0,"I love the shoes, this were are replecement from my old florsheim, I own in the past Bostonians shoes, I switch to florsheim two years ago, but I like Bostonians."
5.0,Give it a couple of weeks to break in and bam!  Instant classic for my collection. Buy now before they go away
5.0,"Took a couple of days to break in where the shoe meets the ankle, but they are comfy now. I am a typical size 11, but these 11's were too narrow. The 11 wides are perfect, and don't have that wide appearance like other brands. I am on my third pair of blacks. I did not like the burgundy color, as they are too dark from my brown suits, to dressy for khakis, and I already have my blacks for dark suits, so they are basically worthless unless I wanted to wear them with a burgundy belt and blue suits. Not great winter shoes as there is no traction on the sole, but oh well."
1.0,"I have bought Bostonian shoes for years.  This is the worst shoe I have bought.  In fact the shoe fits so poorly and needs so much ""break-in"" I doubt I will ever where this shoe or buy another Bostonian.  I put the shoe on and had to take it off immediatley because they just didn't fit the way they should.  This shoe says it was made in India. Past Bostonians I have bought (including my previous pair of Bostonians)were made in Mexico and fit and felt much better.  I guess Bostonian shoes just what they use to be.

Be careful of Gabriel Shoes they said they have had a great return policy (when I bought through Amazon) and when I contacted them by phone after I had trouble with the shoes they said once the Amazon package has been opened  they will not take the shoes backs (even if they didn't fit and where not worn)."
3.0,Shoes are soft and comfortable.  I needed to add a lift in the heel for the side of the shoe hit my ankle bone in the wrong place.  Haven't worn them but once to discover that the sides were 3/8 to high for my ankle bone.
5.0,"my husband purchased a pair of these shoes a few years ago, and wears them almost every day to work.  earlier this year he was moping around the house wishing he had bought 2 or 3 pairs.  we hopped on line, and amazon to the rescue!  great shoes, great price, great look too!"
1.0,I should have ordered a 12 these are too small I can't stand them on for anymore than 15 mins.  I didn't get them retruned in time 9/11/16 was cut off date I tried 9/12/16 to return no luck
5.0,Yes perfect
1.0,"These shoes look great, but unfortunately after owning for a month the eye is tearing. I have never had this happen with a pair of shoes before."
5.0,They fit great
4.0,My husband likes the shoes but wishes they were American made.
5.0,I own several pair of the Bostonian and wear every day in an office environment. The shoe fits and wears well.
3.0,"Nice shoes, but not as wide as US width..EEE should be the same for shoes made in India as those made in the rest of the world."
5.0,Would say the best shoe ever!  Only close!  Great shoes!
4.0,Wellmade .  Still new.  So it will be much better after fewmore days.
5.0,Nice shoe
5.0,this was a gift to my brother law and he like it!!! now every year on xmas I know what to get him....
4.0,I have order a size 8 1/2 and that's what the shoe  size is but to me is 1/2 size bigger. Other than that I like my new shoes.
5.0,Very nice shoes. I wear them to the office everyday. I use these shoes with jeans ( not too distressed jeans)
2.0,Item has been returned.
2.0,"It took several days to break these in, which was fine, I figured they'd last. I've had them  year now, and they need to be replaced. The soles lasted about 9 months before developing the first hole. The leather held up reasonably well, but the stitching is starting to fray. Probably not awful for the price, but the soles not even lasting a year sort of kills it for me."
4.0,Good shoe.
5.0,"Perfect out of the box. I have worn a lot of dress ""business"" over the years, and I know these will be a favorite. Great style. Great fit. Great value."
4.0,"They seem to be ok so far, The fit is not bad comfort level is maybe 8 out of 10. onlyu time will tell"
4.0,"First buy of internet shoes, after one return and replacement works great."
4.0,"Great durable pair of shoes, fits a bit snug but not so much that I couldn't wear them. Break in about 5%."
5.0,Quality shoes and great fit made this purchase perfect.
4.0,These shoes are will constructed and made of good material.  I expect to have and use them for several years.
4.0,I thought they would be more of a double sole with thicker leather uppers - but no. They are a good shoe naytheless!
1.0,"In Amazon's advertisement the shoe is described as ""leather"". But the stamp on the heel describes the shoes as ""coated leather"" (pic attached). This coating gives the shoes a cheap patent leather look. At $122.00 and reading Amazon's description I assumed I was getting leather shoes. Not so. Fit is OK but they look like something a child would wear. Very disappointing!"
5.0,"Great shoes, this my second pair!"
1.0,"i wore this shoe for 20 years. The quality has gone way down. While your feet hurt it takes  2 weeks to break in the shoe! Leather cracks quickly. Don't last a year. Bought Allen Edmonds at three times the price and couldn't be happier. My advice, buy Allen Edmonds, your feet will thank you and in the long run they will cost less."
5.0,"Excellent item, thanks."
3.0,"This is a decent shoe; not great, but a good shoe."
3.0,Not as comfortable as I would like but look great!
4.0,Love them.
4.0,"I have 2 pair, black and burgundy.  Great shoe for dress or office attire"
5.0,Very well fitting shoe.  Appears to be well made.  Classic styling.  I would definitely buy Bostonian again.
1.0,I could NOT believe how small these shoes were. I could NOT get my left foot into the shoe. They were considerably smaller  than every other size 13 I own. I seriously think they were mis-marked. I was VERY disappointed. I was so looking forward to getting and wearing these shoes.
2.0,Shoes look great but the size chart is not accurate
3.0,"I have purchased various types of Bostonian shoes through Amazon for many years.  I recognize these are leather shoes and take a while to break in.  I always have them shipped to my office so I can wear them around in moderation for a few days until they become comfortable enough for ""full time"" wear.  This particular pair seems to be as tight from the outset and slowest in ""loosening"" up as any that I ever recall purchasing."
1.0,"I didn't like the shoe, it didn't look like real leather it look like Patton leather... Not what I expected."
4.0,I've bought these same shoes for years.  This pair is much less flexible and a bit tighter.  Quality of the leather?
5.0,Perfect
1.0,TERRIBLE
5.0,They are so beautiful I can not bring myself to wear them out on the street.
5.0,Great shoes Bostonian does it again
5.0,Quality shoe
1.0,"Let me qualify this review a little, growing up my parents couldn't afford to buy me the fancy big box of crayons, you know the one with the built in sharpener and 128 colors? I was quite content with the 8 crayon package, but what happened as A result is that my ability to name colors is impaired. I can see, differentiate and appreciate color just fine, but I only know a handful of color names. Well, burgundy wasn't in my package of crayons so maybe he name of that color of the shoes I received was burgundy, BUT they were nowhere near the color depicted on the web site.

Now before any aspiring technologist points out my monitor may not be calibrated etc., these were not even close. These shoes were a pinkish purple, and had zero, none, not a hint of depth to the color. It looked like these were spray painted. I was replacing a worn out pair and I had to double take on these. I even went back on line to see if I chose a different color accidentally. These were terrible. The leather was very stiff and the fit ran small.

The photo shows a classically styled long wing tip shoe in a classic deep hue, these shoes were like a bad knock-off of what is shown!"
5.0,My husband hasn't worn them out yet but he liked the way they fit so we are keeping them.  He is pretty picky about dress shoes so that he liked the way they fit even before they are broken in is good.
4.0,"I got these on sale and am pleasantly surprised. I really rolled the dice here. These are quality wingtip shoes that are perfect for the office. My only complaint is that they are taking a while to break in. I wear these at least every other business day and the sides are still stiff, causing discomfort for my ankles. Then again, I am not surprised: I have another pair of Bostonians with which I have had a similar experience. These are durable shoes, so I'd say they are worth the wait -- and the occasional discomfort -- that comes with breaking them in."
4.0,"**UPDATE** I bought a pair of these shoes in size 13, and the fit is great. No complaints about this shoe whatsoever...now that I've got a pair that's a full size larger than I usually wear.

This is my third pair of Bostonians. I have some captoes and some loafers of theirs and I wear them both all the time. I bought these wingtips in my usual size 12, and they are like a hundred-dollar torture device. It feels like someone's standing on my big toes while slicing off my ankles with a rusty knife. I can't decide whether to exchange them for a 13, or just go with a different shoe altogether. I was disappointed because I really wanted to love this shoe, and it ordered them for a special occasion. Another issue I have with them is that the finish looks much less natural than it does in the picture. They are super high gloss and super purple."
5.0,very nice shoes and fits very well
4.0,"Even though my size is  a 8D, the one sent to me is a little bit too small, but it is a great looking shoes,  next time I will get a half size more than my size."
4.0,"Both shoes I purchased have the sides of the shoes higher than I normally wear and they cut into the bottom of my ankles.  A shoe insert solved the problem and they take numerous wearings, a few hours at a time, to get ""broken in"".

Love the shoes, the quality and the look!"
5.0,Great shoe fast shipping!
5.0,"Shoe looks just like the picture. Surprised to see such nice looking shoes at that price. I have a hard time with shoes since I had surgery, but these fit the bill. Haven't worn them all day, but on my initial fitting, leather didn't seem like there would be a long break-in period. I'm happy with my purchase."
3.0,Little stiff. The shoe rubs against my ankle a bit. That will probably get better once broken in. They look great.
5.0,"What a fantastic shoe!  The width, length, style, color...all perfect!!!
it looks exactly like the picture.
In addition the shoe arrived quickly.
I purchased the 9W burgundy and I plan on buying the black one as well in this style.
Huge fan of Bostonian shoes here and I intend on staying loyal to this brand."
5.0,Awesome - beautiful shoes!!!
4.0,"For the price, they're the best wingtip oxfords I've ever owned (and I've owned probably 3 dozen pair in my lifetime)"
2.0,None
5.0,"Nice shoes, but difficult to get broken in. Almost crippled me the first day."
3.0,"Liking everything but the fit at the ankles.  The edges of this shoe dig into the skin under my ankles. It can be painful.  I'm putting heel pads to lift my ankles above the edge of thi shoe, otherwise it's a great shoe."
5.0,Very nice shoe size runs a bit small
5.0,Great shoes. Fits good and comfortable.
4.0,I like it but 11 1/2 will fit better than the 11
4.0,Good job
5.0,I love the shoes and has reccomend them to many people
1.0,The 10.5 fit like a 9. I traveled with these and actually threw them away before traveling back home.
5.0,"Great shoes, true to size.....easy break in period"
5.0,He loves them. Thanks!
1.0,"Having used this shoe in the past, I did not hesitate to purchase them when they were put on sale.  However, what I received wasn't what I had used previously.  The shoe has changed and I found the stiffness unbearable.  I had blisters on my ankles within a few hours and within two days I had blisters on several of my toes.  I must note that the shoe did not feel tight in any way, but the stiffness and molding of the leather just tore me up.  BTW - I requested an exchange, which Amazon handled promptly, but the replacement pair were exactly the same.  As such, after one wearing (and experiencing incredible pain) I was forced to request an exchange again, but this time I chose a Florsheim model and I am now very happy.  So, buy if you must, but consider this a warning..."
5.0,"The shoes fit well and are very comfortable right out of the box.  They are a little heavier than similar shoes that I have purchased from other manufacturers but the additional weight was not noticeable after walking in them for a little while.  The shoes were a good value for the price.  I have paid a lot more for wingtips in the past.  These shoes look good and are a classic style that I expect will serve me for a long time.
Even though the shoes did not ship until several days after my order was placed, they arrived at my home on time, meeting the initial delivery date."
4.0,Excellent fit and quality
5.0,Very nice
4.0,Nice
4.0,Like a leather sole and heal my fault.
5.0,I had ordered the wrong style of Bostonian Wingtip initially.  This shoe was just what I wanted and the exchange was easy.  It fits right and is a great quality shoe.
5.0,"I have worn Bostonian's for 25 years. Stepped into the day one, no pain or discomfort. Walked in them all day. Love them!"
1.0,"After one wear the leather on the top of the shoe began to bubble. It's almost as though the leather has some kind of coating, which began to separate from the leather instantly. Looks bad. Not sure about the quality of these shoes. Bostonian's are typically good. But I'm disappointing in this pair."
5.0,"Good. One step down from Florsheim's flagship shoe, but also half the price. And a shine that doesn't quit."
4.0,Great shoe.  I found the leather a little stiff at first and it was a long first day in them but by the second day of wearing them they became a little more comfortable to wear.  Love the look and feel of this classy shoe.  Can't go wrong with this Oxford.
5.0,"Got these on sale for half what I've paid for same quality shoes at retail shoe stores. As long as you know your size and have no unusual foot problems, even using the sizing chart gets you an excellent fit and value. Great all leather upper and lower dress shoes."
2.0,The shoes look like cheap plastic. They are also very hard and uncomfortable - they cut into the ankle bones. The tongs are too long and cut into the foot.
1.0,"I've always bought these Bostonian wingtips. I could wear them for years, have the soles replaced, and wear them for a few more years.  They broke in well and fit like a glove. But these particular shoes are awful. I mean 'bad'.  The heal KILLS my ankle, the leather is hard, unforgiving, and never broke in.  Something changed in their manufacturing process, and these are not the same shoes I used to buy.

If you are expecting the same Bostonians they made 10 years ago, prepare to be disappointed.  Buy something else."
5.0,I have not worn the shoes enough to break them in yet but I am quite satisfied with their appearance and overall construction.  The shoes appear very durable but still have a nice classic presentation.  The fit was as expected.
5.0,Excellent fit and style.  Nice quality shoe.
3.0,Good looking shoe.  It turned out to be a very tight 10 1/2 Medium.  Other Bostonians have fitted much better.
3.0,"I normally wear size 101/2 but had to order size 11 which fit me more like a normal 101/2, the leather is very stiff to me, it's going to take quite some time to break these in, Bostonian shoes are not the same quality as years ago when they were made in the USA, but they will do for the occasional use that I need them for."
4.0,"Great shoe, but rubbed my ankle enough to make them uncomfortable...a heel cushion solved that problem though."
5.0,"I have always preferred leather soled shoes and these are great, nice looking well made shoes.  I've ordered a second pair."
2.0,Not as expected.
5.0,Very pleased with purchase. As expected. Excellent Quality. Would recommend to others.
5.0,Great shoe
5.0,Looks amazing. Quality construction.
5.0,Comfortable and great looking too!  Got it for dancing. Can't wait to try it out!
5.0,Bostonians have never disappointed.
4.0,I like the shoe... no squeaks and comfortable.
4.0,"Certainly Bostonian is not the company it once was, however, of the old guard of high- end dress shoes that still exist, although, in a lesser form, Bostonians seem to be the best for fit and quality, and they are certainly heads and shoulders above Florsheim and all the modern names. That being said, these shoes look professional, have a good shine, are instantly comfortable to wear, and work in. they look great with a suit and do not creak when you walk. unfortunately, they have that man- made sole, intended to look like leather that never holds up, so the jury is out on sole longevity. If you cannot have a closet full of Allen Edmunds, this shoe serves well until you can."
2.0,"The inner of the shoes are too tight,,,,, usually my size is 10 on shoes, those I will have to keep patient until they enlarge a bit more
Hopefully those are not gonna hurt my feet , otherwise........"
1.0,"This shoes fits as expected. However, the shoes doesn't look anything like in the photo. Its color looks like a cheap paint, which makes the shoes looks like a cheap $1 dollar shoes that you would expect from Salvation Army store."
4.0,"This is a very good looking shoe but not necessarily a Generation X shoe.  This is more of a ""Baby Boomers"" shoe.  The shoe is very comfortable and in a relaxed kind of fashion fits as if it was tailored made just for you."
2.0,"I've worn these shoes the last 5 months hoping they would eventually ""break in"" and become more comfortable.  They are too high on the ankles and after walking a long distance, cause blisters.  They look nice, just uncomfortable."
5.0,My husband has really liked these shoes.  He has always liked the style and these are just what he wanted!
5.0,"I was hard pressed to find a new pair of shoes for a important trip. At the last minute I bought a $200 plus pair of shoes from a brick and mortar store. At home found out they would not work. Cannot find full selection of sizes at those stores anymore. Found the size I thought I needed on Amazon and had rush delivery. Felt good right away, and on trip just got better. Whew, close one. Thank you Amazon."
5.0,I've been wearing these shoes for years and still holding is fine quality. These dress shoes have held up it's value and reputation.
5.0,"Beautiful shoes. Fits well the first day, only needed a short time to break in. If you need a professional shoe, these are the best choice for the money."
3.0,"This is a nice shoe, but it is the width is smaller than listed.  Move up at least one width."
5.0,"Quality shoes. The quality of much of what you buy nowadays is not really that good. I find a pair of shoes that I like, and I stick with them. Over the years, you can really see the drop in quality of some brands. But not these. Kudos Bostonian."
2.0,"I thought when I ordered that I would get a pair of Johnston & Murphy, which I didn't. I probably did not read the text good enough!? I started with J&M, an excellent American manufacturer and ended up with a pair of shoes made in India. Disappointing."
2.0,The shoes are around one size too small so please allow one size larger then you normally are. Quality is very good
4.0,The shoe is well made.  It is a good looking and stylish shoe.  It has good support and it fits comfortably.
5.0,These shoes arrived today. I tried them on. They came in perfect condition and fits well. Leather is shinny and shoes look stylish. I would highly recommend it.
4.0,"Well, I love my Wing-tips, and perhaps the subject was a bit misleading, but, these are a very good quality shoe that I just bought recently and have worn to work one time only. The leather is still tight but I expect they are like my last pair of Bostonian's; and like any fine leather product, once they break in, they will end up being my favorites! Bostonians seem very durable and stylish."
5.0,"This is a great pair of shoes. They are light, comfortable and I would buy them again. I couldn't find a decent pair of shoes locally and decided to take a shot on these."
5.0,Thanks again the deal was great looking forward to deal with you again every thing was great  thank you again
5.0,Very beautiful shoes and feel comfortable. Well crafted and designed products from Bostonian and I like all my shoes from them.
5.0,"Great shoe, a well constructed classic. Only drawback is you need to water proof the sole because an all leather sole soaks up water on rainy days, slush and salt on winter days which will eventually ruin the sole. Bottom line is you have to take care of the shoe for it to last."
5.0,"They feel a little stiff, but I think that's to be expected with a new pair of shoes. Very shiny. I'm happy I purchased them."
5.0,"For the price, they can't be beat! Looked all over for the right type of oxfords - knew Bostonians worked for me but couldn't find Oxfords in a store, even in NYC."
4.0,"I had similar ones before and they were good all around shoes for a full day of work and social outing.
I have not had time to wear those (less than a week now) to opine on the quality."
5.0,One of the best shoes I have enjoyed. It fits ok and the prices are very good. I recommend this kind of shoes.
5.0,The shoes arrived just when I started my Christmas vacation so my first chance to wear them was for Christmas mass.  I worried that being new they would hurt my feet but the leather broke in very gently and they felt great.  I have been getting these shoes for years so I knew my correct size especially with the width otherwise I would never buy shoes w/o first trying them.  I look forward to years of happy wear.
1.0,"i usually buy 9.5M Bostonians. this one was way too tight even after months and caused pain to my foot. Furthermore, I found traces of glue on the soul sides that i can't remove. it's just low quality, uncomfy and waste of money!"
5.0,This size and style of Bostonian (LUXE) fits me fine -- very comfortable after less than one hour's wear.  The shoe easily accommodates my orthopedic appliance (arch support)
5.0,Great shoes! Fit perfect. My old Bostonians needed a rest and these new ones fit great. The order was filled promptly.
1.0,"The shoes are much more narrow than any EE wide shoes I own, they are also shorter than any 10.5 shoes I own.  However they have also been worn before!  The leather soles have been scuffed as though someone had walked on a concrete surface for a day.  No thanks."
5.0,"I have a wide foot, hard to find exactly what I want and still maintain that classic, stylish look of a great wingtip.  Shoe fits very good, comfortable to wear, even though they are not broke in at all.  I don't wear the shoes a lot, but it is nice to be able to slip them on and not have the shoes hurt my feet.  Will order a pair in cordovan and brown."
5.0,"These are the best dress shoes I've ever had!!! They are comfortable, and they go great with formal and formal/casual attire."
3.0,My husband loves the shoes but it was too small for him. He is a size 9-9.5 under Crocs size so we ordered this in size 9.5. But it is way too narrow for him and he ended up with blisters after 1 day of wearing to work.
3.0,"Too small for me despite the fact that my size is 9. However, the shoe is beautiful and well crafted."
3.0,"The shoe looked beautiful but I was dismay to find out that the shoe size 9M was too tight for me when I tried it. I use size 9M, I wonder if the shoe is really size 9M, though size 9M is written on it. Please I need a reply from the seller."
4.0,Good shoe. Fit as expected and looks good. I can wear it all day without it pinching my foot. I recommend this shoe.
2.0,"Seems smaller than other Bostonians I used. Leather is not that high quality also. Color is ok, not the best."
3.0,"These shoes get the job done. If you don't have the money for a pair of Allen Edmonds and you still want wingtip oxfords, these are a decent alternative.

Mine began to have a very noticeable crease on the top middle area after a few weeks of wear. This is even when using shoe trees after every wear and polishing once a week. It is much more pronounced in one shoe than the other. I'm not particularly knowledgeable of what having very flat feet can do to the contours of a shoe, but I wouldn't be surprised if my feet exacerbated the process.

They aren't very comfortable, but that could be due to the reason above and might be able to be remedies with a good pair of Powerstep orthotic inserts."
5.0,"I brought black and white ones for Halloween. They are cute and will work for that. I don't normally wear tights like this. I might even make something totally different out of them after Halloween (I sow and make things like dolls, napkins, hair bows, etc)."
4.0,"I bougth them for my girlfriend and she loved them, its like a universal size I think so its great for a surprise..."
1.0,"Item is not hot pink as pictured, it is pale pink, unhappy customer :(.  They need to be more accurate with pictured photo."
1.0,Maybe my tights were mislabeled?  I bought the one size fits most black and orange tights.  The package says 90 lbs to 160 lbs.  I weigh 120 lbs and the tights do not pull all the way up!  Super tight.  Will try to get through the day for Halloween.  HOW could someone that is 160 lbs fit in these???
4.0,product should reflect what is being purchased and clearly state what colors it is. Having a picture of white and black stockings should be acompanied with a description with black and white stockings not purple.
2.0,"These tights were about a foot too short.  I got a size that should have been too big and they are 2 small to wear.  These seem to be sized for Juniors, not adults"
5.0,"I was glad to have finally found a pair of red and black stockings after searching through EVERY store at Halloween and coming up empty handed. Reasonably priced, they were exactly what I was looking for and arrived on time."
5.0,Purchased these for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves them!
5.0,Perfect fit.
2.0,"My daughter loved the look of  these tights but they did NOT fit. She is around 5 foot 7 and 160 pounds, and they were way too small and too short. Had to return."
5.0,Great under a big comfy dress!
5.0,Bought this for a costume it worked out great!
4.0,"Use gently!  A good product, but very fragile. Snags and tiny holes are very easy to make."
5.0,Just as you would expect. The tights did their job and held up well. I wore them to work for a Christmas costume. Im a server and they held up well. Very comfortable.
4.0,"The quality isn't great and I feel like they're going to run easily, but theyll do the trick for my one time wear on Christmas. Im 58 and around 140 pounds and these were nearly too small for me. I don't think theyll be long enough for anyone taller than my height."
5.0,I love them got lots of compliments
5.0,"Great nylon striped tights! These were perfect for a Christmas party. I am 5'0, 115lbs. they fit perfectly! The material is like panty hose, not like tights. nice and bright red/white."
1.0,When I put these on they had a small hole and a run in them. Im 52 and couldn't get them on as they were too small. Very disappointing.
4.0,"i love these at Christmas time...i love to wear these because people notice them and are quite attractive.
I would of given them a 5 Star but they snag fairly easy and the pattern is a bit off.
BUT THEY SURE LOOK NICE ON"
5.0,love them!  I'm wearing them now for my holiday luncheon at work along with my Christmas dress and it completes the look perfectly.
5.0,These were perfect!  They were well made a fun to wear and a good price
5.0,fit fine and were of good quality of thickness
5.0,"Good quality, lasted for many wears..thank you!"
3.0,"These are very cute stockings.  However, I am about 5'7 and these were at least 2 inches too short.  I gave them to my daughter but very disappointed that there wasn't much stretch in the length."
4.0,nice tights
5.0,"Loved these tights, they fit perfectly and came on time. Good quality and I would order again."
5.0,Great stocking! They look just like the picture. Very comfortable. I'm 5 foot and 100 pounds. They fit very well.
5.0,Got these to wear with my Winifred Sanderson costume.  I am 5'5 / 150lbs and they fit just fine.
5.0,these fit nicely and look good. excellent for the price
1.0,Very poor fit
5.0,Awesome!
2.0,"I would have given this product 5 stars, as it fit nicely and looks as good as the photo. However, it came with a dime sized hole around one knee, which ran as soon as I tried them on.  What a shame I had ordered it well in advance of when I used it, so I couldn't return for a new one.  I'm not sure of the frequency of such defects, but if mine was a fluke, then I'd recommend these to others.  As it is, I cannot."
5.0,Super cute. Fit as expected
5.0,Really liked these. The color was good and they were on the thicker side. They were a perfect finish for my witch costume this year.
3.0,Decent for a Halloween costume. Pretty thin and see-through
5.0,"I bought them knowing they would be too short, but I needed these for my bee club halloween party.  I can't tell you how delighted I was!  If I could have chosen the perfect fit, this would be it.  There were several items in this order, but I went out of my way to write a review only on thiese tights.  They are perfect!  (I'm 5'7"", 140 lbs)"
3.0,"I managed to get them on well enough for my costume, but thankfully Im wearing them with a long skirt. They are kinda sagging in the crotch because they are a little short in the legs and I am by no means a tall girl. They are also fairly tight with on me. They fit fine for my costume, but Im 54 155 usually a size 10 and these are pretty tight on me."
5.0,"I'm 5 foot 0 inches, 115 pounds. They fit perfectly for me, but are just a little tight on my waist. Coloring is perfect for my cosplay!"
5.0,"Exactly what I expected, which is fine.
Was worried about the delivery time. But it arrived before the listed date. So Im happy!"
2.0,too thin and run big
5.0,"Fits a little small, as most Halloween tights tend to do.  Good quality, took awhile for shipping."
4.0,"Based on the other reviews, I was very surprised these actually fit. I'm 5'8"" 137, so I expected these to be way too short as others complained about. Sure, they could be an inch or so longer, but they aren't going to cause me to have to stop and hoist them up every 10 minutes."
5.0,Excelent
5.0,Great for xmas and st pattys day
5.0,"I'm about 5'4"" and 170ish pounds and these fit perfectly. I was expecting them to be super cheap and thin but they're actually decent quality!"
5.0,I got these for my wife and she loves them! She says they're very good. Quality and they're very light and comfortable. She says that they are a tiny bit tight though.  She's 5'5 and a size 7 in jeans.  If you're bigger then that these probably won't fit.  But for the price she says they're amazing. And she looks adorable in them.  These are a perfect gift for that special goth chick in your life!
4.0,Bought 20 pairs for a theatre show. One child's tights were way more orange than the rest. So am reordering to see what we get.
5.0,Great fit. Good quality. Service was good. Shipped quickly.
5.0,Perfect for custome arrived on time
5.0,A+
4.0,Worked out great for St. Patty's Day.
3.0,Red striped tights section does not continue on up to the waist and might show a solid red area if the costume is short.
5.0,They look and feel great! They arrived in a timely fashion as well :)
5.0,Beloved tights!
5.0,The sizing was great and it will make a perfect addition to my costume.
5.0,I wear a lot of black tights for work and these tights are more comfortable than what I expected. They are soft and stretchy and don't bind at the waist like I'm used to. Too bad I can't wear these striped tights everyday.
3.0,"The quality isn't great but I'm just needing to use these tights one time for a run that I'm dressing up for so it's ok.
However one size fits all isn't the case! These would fit a size small to medium.
To give you an idea who they will fit,I'm 5'6 1/2
And 125lbs they fit me perfect. I'm not overweight but I'm not especially thin either. Athletic build and what weight I do carry is all in my thighs and but...."
2.0,"One size does NOT fit all.  I'm 5'1"" and 140 pounds and these are too small.  I have to pull and tug to get them up to my waist, and still the crotch sits weird.  They are very uncomfortable.  I'm disappointed."
5.0,Super cute! Wear with navy blue dress
5.0,So cute and look great
5.0,Love them :)
3.0,Much too small.
2.0,I give this two stars only because these leggings are absolutely adorable. Unfortunately they are more like a child or youth size.
5.0,We use these for a Family Christmas Game
1.0,"Extremely disappointed in these. I'm an average size woman, 10, and 5'4"". These were so small I couldn't get them up to my hips."
3.0,"These tights are not for people with double digit sizes or hips. After a few adjustments and limited time, I just cut them into stockings. I wish they were more true to the sizing chart because I am a size 10 and these still did not fit comfortably. Maybe mine were just a bad batch."
5.0,My girls love these!!
5.0,
5.0,"I bought these to dress up as a Christmas elf. I was surprised at their quality and fit. For one-size tights, these fit beautifully, look great, and I expect them to wash and wear well. They are warm, too."
4.0,Good snags easily
5.0,great
5.0,Great for St. Patrick's day.
5.0,Cute. Slightly opaque.
5.0,My daughter loves them!
3.0,Cute tights and they feel nice. Only problem I have is the size. Once it reaches my upper thighs it's a battle to get them to cover my butt.
2.0,I was able to get a group picture with them on. Right when I bent down to get something they ripped..
5.0,worked great.
2.0,"The tights are supper cute, but were really small around my waist. They are ""a one size fits all"" but be careful if you are heavier around the stomach. Im a size 12."
3.0,It was just what I needed.  But when I put them on. There was a hole already in the seam.  As I needed them for that day only I just used them.
2.0,"I'm 5'7"" and these ran too short. NOT one size fits all..."
3.0,"Nice for the price, but they fall down. I was constantly pulling them up all day. Purchased for Halloween, and they worked well, but
I would not want to wear them for every day."
4.0,"Bought this to go with my Halloween costume - had them on time and they fit just fine. I was concerned about them being One Size but they were comfortable and fit well. I am 5'1"", 125lbs."
1.0,"These were delivered brand new with a hole in them.  I was unable to return them before I needed them, so I had to wear them with the hole.  Very disappointed in this product."
5.0,"Love the material and the color.
I'm not skinny but I have skinny legs so they weren't so tight in me and I'm 5'2 so they were a little large. I think they're great for someone tall!"
1.0,The one size fits most  was about a foot and a half to short. Big Bummer!
5.0,Pretty well sewn tights.  They fit nice with no irregularities.  These were purchased for a costume.
5.0,Great
1.0,"Honestly, this purchase has been the worst from amazon to date.  Usually I'm very impressed with all my purchases but this one pissed me off.  First off, these didn't arrive anywhere near on time.  I received them almost a week after the expected date and to top it off, the sizes were WAY off.  Im not that big!  Im 5'8"" and 160 lbs!  I ordered the orange and black ones, they came in one size but I was not expecting that one size to fit a prepubecent child.  I couldn't even pull these up past my hips.  They were either made for a 10 year old or an abnormally tiny woman.  Now it's about 6 days until halloween and I gotta run out to spirit store and buy a decent pair from there.  Just a huge waste of time and energy.  Had I known I would have waited nearly a month for them only for them to not fit, I would have just gone out and bought some.  Thanks amazon seller guy.  Great job.  BOO.  "
5.0,Il be looking great for halloween
4.0,"They are larger than I expected but that was a nice surprise seeing as though most costume accessories run super small! I am 115 lbs and they are a little big for me to wear so keep that in mind. However, fast shipping and quality leggings- I would absolutely recommend this company and product to friends!"
5.0,"LOVED IT, FIT GREAT!"
4.0,"Loved these. They fit just fine and were super cute.
My only gripe is that they ran in the heel after a couple hours of wear."
2.0,"Fair quality, poor fit on my 5'9"" 160 lb frame."
5.0,Fit was as expected. Color was as advertised and received quickly.
4.0,"They fit me fine, but I'm short.  Someone taller might find them too short."
3.0,Bought to accessorize a costume.  Would not want to wear with any regularity.
5.0,Great for costume
2.0,They are way too short and don't fit my legs SOS. Just an average sized human bean ugh.
4.0,"As another poster said, this is made for shorter ladies. I'm 6'2 and had cut off the ends to make it fit. I would assume that 5'6 and under would probably be the max."
5.0,Looks and fits great! And came two weeks early! Love!
4.0,They were perfect for our event. I wish the torso part was a little bigger as they kept rolling down.
2.0,They came in way too small
4.0,Fit is as expected. Nice for a costume.
5.0,Perfect accessory
5.0,Nice pair of tights.  The fabric is stretchy and fits nicely. I know they say one size. But if you are on the heavy side they maybe kind of tight. These are just like normal nylons and kind of thin. Plus they are my favorite color. (Orange) They even have that look that can be used for Halloween.
3.0,"The package says it will fit up to 145lb.  Yes, it will.  But only if you have short legs.  I'm giving these to my 13 year of niece how if short."
4.0,Only needed them for Halloween.  Fit as expected and held up well.
5.0,As expected
3.0,"These FINALLY arrived, hours before needing them for Halloween. Shipping took a long time. They are just what I needed; however, they are NOT plus size. I'm 5'6, 150 and these barely fit. I ordered the black/green in ""one size/plus size"". They're currently hanging half way off my butt, but they're under a skirt, so it's fine. I had to put in work to get them up even that far. I was expecting them to be too big, because they're supposed to be plus size. That would have been fine, but there's no way they can be. They would definitely not fit someone any bigger than me."
1.0,"Cute, but super small. Sized more for Junior's than Women's clothing. I am a very average 5'7"", 150#s. These only came about halfway up my thighs are were super tight. Luckily I only needed them for a Halloween party costume, so with a little judicious use of scissors, I could get by for the night."
5.0,Just as described and what I needed for my costume.
2.0,"I don't know what women they think would fit in these! I am 5'3"" and 160 lbs, about a size 12 which is *not* considered plus size. I was silly to think that these tights would fit me being one size fits all! If you are very skinny with thin calves and thighs, these may fit you. However I had a tough time even getting them up above my knees. I usually dress up with my son on Hallowen so he was the Scarecrow, my niece was Dorothy, and I needed these tights to be the Wicked Witch. I did wear them anyway because they arrive literally an hour before we were going Trick or Treating and I didn't have a back up, but they were very uncomfortable and I felt like I was in danger of losing them for the hour or two I had them on. I wouldn't purchase this brand again."
5.0,Arrived quickly & looks as expected.
4.0,You might think about putting a chart so people will know which sizes are included in your one size fits all category.
4.0,Good
3.0,Very cute!
3.0,These held up for 8 performances without any problem
5.0,I bought these tights as part of my Halloween costume.  They worked perfect!
3.0,it was smaller than what i was expecting... i had to cut them to be able to use them with my halloween costume
2.0,"Thinner than expected.  Says one size fits all but it fits more like a small or extra small.  Low wasted and kept slipping down my bottom.  I'm a women's size 6.  They were cute so they did the trick but I also expected the panty part to be be striped, but instead it was solid green."
3.0,"""One size"" is not tall enough for a 5'8"" woman. Also developed a run in the first few hours of wear. OK for a few hours on Halloween maybe, but they were uncomfortably unable to be pulled up completely."
3.0,I was expecting the tights to stretch a little more than they did but that didn't bother me as much as I could see through them slightly. I found them to be on the thin side and a bit unforgiving with movement but they did the job.
4.0,"I'm an average height/build (5'7"" 145-150... Not super thin/not chunky).... Leg Ave hose are made for skinny girls, always have been lol. I generally try to find their plus size. These fit fine around the waist and legs (not tight, didn't create a muffin top) but they fell a couple inches short and I had to keep tugging them up so I didn't start feeling like a penguin.

Since they're opaque tights, I was able to pull on them fairly strongly (w nails) and they didn't puncture or run so that's a plus, especially for $5!"
2.0,"I'm 5'8"" and wear a size 8/10.  These tights don't come past my hips!  Would probably fit perfectly if I were about 5 inches shorter."
3.0,Was looking at wearing these for Halloween but they were a little too small and got run's in them when I tried to pull them up. Will not buy again.
5.0,These tights are good quality.  My daughter has worn them at least 20 times and there are no runs or pulls.
2.0,For one size they are small. Can't get them up past my hips which are medium size.
5.0,"I loved these, and they fit great. Some of the reviews said they're too tight. Well, if you're overweight, then yeah, they're going to be too tight on you. Find something suitable for plus sizes. These worked just as they should. They looked great on St. Patrick's Day. I actually cut them into stockings, then the top part I made into a pair of underwear/shorts."
2.0,"Don't order this if you have big thighs. Did not fit, was not opaque at all, and are made for small, short girls. Couldn't even wear them."
3.0,Good for a day
2.0,Ended up tearing
4.0,Good
5.0,"I bought these to go with a Harry Potter outfit. They fit well, very stretchy."
4.0,Very cute!
1.0,"I could not pull these tights over my butt! They are like super low rise tights! Hated them! Also, I am 5'3"" and I weigh 130 pounds. Maybe these are for children."
3.0,"These are not for adults, teens maybe. I usually wear a B in regular tights and these were too small."
2.0,"The material is not stretchy. I'm only 5'2, and it barely fit. It also kept sliding off. You won't be able to move in them unless you are at most 5'0""."
3.0,"I haven't actually worn these yet, just tried them on. They do seem to fit a little small. I'm 5'3"" with muscular legs and used every last bit of fabric to pull these puppies up. Even then they don't seem to quite fit over my bottom all the way. Curvy and/or taller women beware!"
4.0,"I used these for a dance costume, so I was moving a lot and they held up great.  However I have long legs and anything that says ""one size fits all"" really means ""one size fits anyone 5' 4"" and under or for those with abnormally short legs"". They did hold up, but weren't the best fit."
5.0,The stalkings are perfect quality and not to thin and are not see through. Bought to match my Alice in Wonderland costume and they are perfect!!
4.0,Purchased for an ice show.  Good quality. Lasted well and looked super cute in Christmas number!  only thing not expected was plain at top of leg (not pictured. Should have assumed as much but...)
3.0,"I am 5'7'' and these tights were a little short for me. I was able to wear them, but they could have bee a bit taller. I used these for a bee costume, i was happy with the product for the price."
5.0,"stockings are super cute and of great quality. I am 5' and about 100 lbs, and they go where I want them to go, which is a good thing for a short girl; however, the socks don't feel very stretchy and tall girl should consider about the length before buying. I love them!!"
2.0,"I think these are girls Nylons instead of women's.  I'm only 5'4"" and they were about 12 inches too short."
5.0,My daughter purchased these for cosplay & loves them! They're well made & they look and fit exactly as expected.
4.0,I bought these to wear with a green tutu for St. Patty's Day.  They were a great addition to the costume.  The texture was a little rough but no real complaints.
4.0,"Fit's nicely.  You can really tell the difference from a plus size and a large.  The usually large sized one's I buy I really have to work to fit at the crotch, these I didn't.  There was one minor flaw, one of the black stripes high up the thigh had a spot where it was much more translucent than the rest, not a run though.  Luckily it is VERY high up the thigh and you can't see it while wearing a skirt."
2.0,"Far too short for my height, 5'7"". If you're shorter they might be ok.  Very thin and the sizing is inaccurate."
3.0,Fairly cheap but that's what I expected for the price.  I was able to wear them but they definitely run small.
1.0,They advertised these for women HA! Maybe if you were a very very petite woman - Gave these to my 10 year old niece
2.0,"Tried putting these on and honestly thought, huh maybe they sent me a Girl's size.  These are for adults?  I am only 5'4, they wouldn't pull up to even cover my backside.  Returned them."
5.0,purchased to go with an Alice in Wonderland costume. They fit perfect and were absolutely adorable. Adult women size s/m
2.0,"I bought these to wear with a mini and boots for the holidays, and while everyone thought I looked cute, I kept hiking them up all day! The stockings just didn't stay up because of the thin material. Fine for one day, but I probably won't wear them again."
3.0,They fit the need. I wore them to our family Christmas Eve celebration. They were way too long for me. That's better than being too short I suppose.
1.0,The tights are advertised at one size fits all. They only came up to upper thigh and I am 5'6. The colors also got dulled because they had to stretch so much. Not impressed.
5.0,These were really cute.  I used them for a green/white candy cane Christmas costume.  They were adorable.  The adult ones fit a size 12 girl quite well.
1.0,"There was a defect in the way they were made. There was a piece of material going from the panty part to one of the legs, which I had to cut just to get them on. That, of course, caused a massive run in the panty part. They made it through the day and immediately went in the trash after."
3.0,"They were too short and I am only 5ft 5 inches.  They were not too tight, but I could not pull them up.  I will give them to my niece."
3.0,"Do not be fooled by the ""One Size Fits Most."" It doesn't. I'm a very petite 5'2"" with a 29-30"" inseam. My size varies between a 0 and a 4 depending on who designes an outfit. I got these on okay, but I cannot imagine how anyone with longer legs or a larger girth would ever be able to get these up all the way without turning them into thigh-highs!"
3.0,"Look just as pictured (red/black) but the one size was smaller than expected. They may fit someone size 10 and under. Overall not bad other than the fit, for the price paid."
3.0,They served the purpose but they are MUCH shorter than expected.  I'm 5'9 and it took forever to get them on beause you had to stretch them.
3.0,"The color was great, but I am only 5' 6"" and these were not long enough. I was constantly yanking them up all evening.  I would not buy them again.  If you are petite, then they would be perfect for you.  But if I were one inch taller, I don't even see how they could be wearable."
4.0,"I have wide hips and fit most full, non thigh-hi nylons without difficulty. They pucker a bit at my middle on some, but I was almost unable to get this pair to my middle, which is a first for me. If you're a big wide in the hips (I wear a pant size around 11-12 depending on if they are from the juniors or womens departments) and I know I have curvy thighs too but I didn't expect to have difficulty fitting into these. I rarely have problems fitting into one-size items and only on thigh-highs like I said. Might want to up to the plus or shop elswhere if you're unsure if you'll fit, too."
2.0,"Super fragile, not reinforced in the crotch area, so they sorta feel like they're going to split there, especially since they're a little small. The color changes from one stripe to the next are not dyed, they are actually different threads, so there are little black threads and little purple threads that stick out at each color change spot on the inside, and you can see them. They look weird."
4.0,"The material on these tights is pretty sturdy. The middle seam is a bit off center, so feels a little funny, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  Otherwise, this is a great purchase. Very fun tights."
5.0,"The tights are of good quality, fit well and are as vibrant as you can imagine !  They are the perfect accent to my ""Bee Costume""."
2.0,"CAN'T WEAR THEM, I'M SIZE 14 AND 5'8"" AND I CAN'T PULL IT ALL THE WAY UP, GOT ANOTHER PAIR TO WEAR THAT ARE ONLY THIGH HIGH SINCE ALL OF THESE SEEM TO BE ONE SIZE FITS ALL"
1.0,"I knew I had not ordered yellow and black but when I went back and looked at my order the correct picture is shown and highlighted but with a wrong color in the smaller print. Also free shipping doesn't apply, even if I had qualified with the rest of my order, that was sort of tricky at check out. Shipping is way more than the tights. Will contact the company to see if they can replace the tights."
2.0,"Have a costume party to go to this Sunday the 13th. I ordered Black and White One Size tights, only to receive Purple and Black Plus Size tights instead! Now I have to return the item and go out to the store to find the right color and size. Very Frustrated!!! Plus note: The shipping only took three days."
3.0,"If you're as thin as a pin these will work perfectly for you. However, me with my big thigh self cannot have the tights make it up as high as the picture. They fit me everywhere else, but once they get to my thighs, they stop. They are not connected like tights normally are, but they act like super tall socks. I really wanted to wear them, so I cut the tops of them and used them as short socks.  They look really nice as socks, and people are always complimenting me on them, but I didn't want socks. I wanted tights."
5.0,They're tights. Pretty much a one size fits all deal. They were red and white striped. I was a candy cane.
4.0,"I bought these tights for a costume, and I like them, they are silky, but they are very thin.  I was worried about wearing them on my wood floor, and would be very careful taking them on or off.  But for the cost, I really don't care.  Just don't expect them to last too long."
2.0,"I bought this and was within the size range. What a bunch of malarky. They may be perfect for your average starved teenager. And by that I mean 12-13 yro.
Sent them back."
1.0,"They are labelled as adult, but would better fit a junior. Arrived with runs already in one pair.
Fit is not correct as sizing is inaccurate."
4.0,"I have the red and white pair - and they are really fun.  I'm old - so I don't have as many opportunities to wear them as I'd like but I've worn them under a floor length ball gown - that was super fun, and I've worn them under a big shirt like PJ pants..."
5.0,"The GF likes these. She can ware them out of the house and look good.
We pick out items we can't find locally and I buy she looks good"
4.0,"I'm 5'7"" with a round bottom and thighs. I found it a bit troublesome to get the stockings all the way up. They sit at my hips but don't reach my waist, and are tight around my legs. They get more comfortable as you wear them, and they stretch just a bit with wear, but these are definitely junior sized and shouldn't be labeled as adult women's nylons. So if you're any bigger than me, don't order these tights."
1.0,"The tights pictured are full length but the ones I received were barely above my knee. They were much too tight as well, my legs actually started to go numb! I'm not a stick figure by any means but I'm not so big that I would expect for that to be a problem. I have other pairs of leg avenue one size tights that fit much better so it was surprising. I certainly didn't think I would need to order in a plus size in order to feel my legs. Very disappointing."
5.0,I bought these in green and black stripe tights for my ugly sweater christmas party with friends.  Many compliments :)
3.0,"I chose to give it three stars because it does what it is supposed to do but it's not exactly what I wanted.

Well, it fits.  I can pull it all the way up to my waist, but it took effort.  Yeah, I know it is because I'm on the heavier side but I'm just telling you.  Okay so, it's not too tight on the crotch area but it's still tight enough to make me worry that it might rip if I move around too much. Another thing is that you can see your flesh color through the white stripes.  Oh and if anyone wants to know, around two inches before the crotch part of the tights, the stripes stop and it is just white.

I will say that if you are skinny, then these will probably work perfect for you.  Maybe it is just me but I'm a size 7 in jeans and this is just okay."
1.0,"I had to work HARD to get into these, and could only get them to the middle of my butt, the the crotch way to low and they won't stay up....they are VERY short, not for anyone taller than 5'8"""
4.0,"I bought these (in red and black) for my 11 year old daughter to wear as the girl from Hotel Transylvania. She is rough on tights, so I didn't rate them significantly lower for the run she got while wearing them to a Halloween party (indoors and only played video games/watched movies so she wasn't running around outside).

The good part was since she wears a size 2 to 3 juniors jeans (for the full backside she has) and the jeans are too long, these tights fit her without being stretched thin. So, when the run did happen, it was hidden well. If she had been adult size I believe they'd have been unusable  for actual Halloween."
3.0,"two things: these were indeed green and white.  I wasn't sure since the picture showed black and white but they are the correct colors.  Secondly, they are great quality but they are a bit short.  I am 5'7 with what I consider short legs and they are too short. I can make it work but wish they were longer"
1.0,"The ""one size fits all"" size description said 90-160 pounds, and I am well within that range and 5'8"".  They were way too short - the crotch was halfway to my knees.  I then cut the feet out thinking I might still be able to wear them with boots - but they were much too tight in the waist to wear comfortably or sit down. During my efforts to get them on they ran, and I threw them away.  Don't waste your money unless you're very petite!"
1.0,"Horrible fit and garbage quality. I barely got them out of the package and they ran. I put them on and they are tight in the legs and the crotch is about two inches too low.  I am 5'2"" 120 lbs what chance these would fit someone bigger? I am so upset, I am on my way to a party with no way to replace these first. Do not buy these unless you want to look lik crap."
2.0,"I ordered these tights for Halloween, and they say they are one size fits all with a weight range of 90lb-160lb. I am 140lb. Should work right? Not exactly. The tights don't even pull all the way up to my waist, and when I was putting them on they ran immediately. I admit, I have a few lbs to lose, but I am by no means obese and well within the expected range of fit. I would not suggest this for anyone larger than a size 7 or so, based on how much they stretch girth wise vs. length wise."
4.0,Order a size up. I ordered my normal size first and was a tad small the size up fit perfectly.
5.0,Super awesome shoes and surprisingly comfortable!
5.0,very comfortable!!! they are great
2.0,"I have the black pair, and I've never had a problem with them. I got the red ones in and the first day I wore them for a costume, the red started peeling off and the sole of the shoe came off! I almost took a tumble down the escalator! Never again!"
5.0,"Bought a size larger (just in case) and they fit perfect. They were a good quality for the price and even though I bought them for a holiday party, I will wear them again next year with a different costume."
4.0,"The top of this boot is 14 inches in diameter (size 9). If your calf is 14 to 15 inches it should fit fine. Any more than that, it does not look good with the lace loops getting farther apart toward the top of the boot. They run a bit small so get a half size or one size larger. The boot is made well, I wish it would have fit. A little more information about the top diameter would have been helpful. We will be sending the boots back.

Edit: There was no streching the boots we got. I don't know if they sent the wrong boots."
2.0,"The boots fit on my foot fine, but the part around the my calf was too wide even when I tighten the boots. If you're a big woman with thick calfs then these boots will be suitable. The service was quick to send & came in new condition but the boots weren't the right ones for me."
4.0,The shoes fit well and have good support. My only problem is that I have skinny legs and my calves swim in these boots. I prefer my boots to form fit around my calves. I can dance in these all night though without getting sore feet which is great.
5.0,Beautiful
4.0,"The calf is a little short, should or could have been an inch more. The material is kind of thin (cheap) but I love the style."
3.0,"Well, of course with me being a cross-dresser, that that into account when reading my review.

The boots did fit rather nicely, a tiny bit tight around the ankle area, but once again this may not even be the case for you.

My only real complaint was that how easily the strings become untied/undone, it was frustrating because when one unravels then the one beneath is now more likely to come undone as well."
5.0,I love the boots!
5.0,i love them!!!
5.0,I love these boots!!
4.0,It was very good
5.0,"Very comfortable, i more than comic-con and felt very comfortable in these heels they don't look very comfortable but they really are and the leather isn't exactly stretchy but still fit very well"
5.0,"This pendant is definitely worth the money!  The way the facets shine in the sunlight is so beautiful!
Great piece of jewelry."
5.0,I have several Vitrail items from Gem Avenue and each piece is so unique they have a way of picking up the light and colors. I always get compliments when I wear them. Gem Avenue is great!
5.0,"I got this one and the blue and purple and gave my wife and daughter 1st choice, 3rd going to her aunt but they all share the 3 and trade off!  Fine by me, long as they are happy!
  Sunlight makes them all sparkle but I think I like this one the best for its multicolor."

I found no flaws in either one of the crystals and was very pleased with the quality.  I would definately recommend either pendant for wear with various tops , dresses, and sweaters."
5.0,"These are great shoes. When my son outgrew them, I grabbed them, and that was a few years ago. I am a (large) woman with wide feet, and women's shoes just aren't made as well as mens. These fit great, feel great, and wear extremely well. I'm pretty rough on my shoes, and with no care (I'm lazy), they still look great. I like the way they look. The only wear I see is on the soles (but they are very long-lasting), so I will probably be wearing them another 5 - 10 years! They aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for. In the long run, they are a real bargain, and when it comes to your feet, comfort, durability and common sense wins.

Another reviewer mentioned a squeak - mine don't squeak at all. In fact, that's one reason I wear them at work, my sneakers squeak terribly.

I also don't notice any leakage when I trek around in the rain and snow.

I love them!"
5.0,"Incredibly comfortable shoes that age rather well.  No problems with them whatsoever.  They are very well made and long lasting.  I've had my pair for a year now and I wear them nearly four fifths of the time and they still look great.  These are great shoes for anyone looking for a classy pair of slip on shoes who are sick of the ""quality"" of cheaper leather loafers from other companies like Sketcher's.  But yes, as aforementioned, they will need to be water proofed.  But, so do nearly all leather shoes."
5.0,"Great shoes. I have never had any pain from wearing them -- I walk on concrete all day.  Unfortunately, I have worn them out after 2 years(no more tread on sole--I wear them just about every day), but I will buy a new pair; they are THAT good."
5.0,"These slip-ons are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  It feels like I am wearing house slippers every time I put them on.  If I had any critique at all, you will want to waterproof them regularly.  When I wear them in the rain, the water splashes up onto the toe and after a while will soak through.  But a good mink oil will take care of this.  Sad to say I've just about worn my pair out (I wear them every day to work)...I'll be on the lookout for another pair to replace them!  Maybe I'll get one of each color this time!?!?  You will not be disappointed!!"
5.0,"This is a very nice ring and is an even better price. It could be used as a promsie ring or just a ring to give to someone or to buy yourself. The style of the ring is unique and amazing. I love it, or should I say my girlfriend loves it."
5.0,"This ring could be mistaken for a diamond, i've had 3 people say they want it. I bought it for myself because i never got a ""promise"" ring from anyone, and if i had a daughter, this would definately be a a gift i would get her for an important occasion. It's that beautiful!!!!"
5.0,"EDITED (3 x)

I RECEIVED this ring from my BF for our 6 month anniversary as a promise ring and I absolutely love it!

SINCE THE REVIEW ABOVE, the stone fell out of the ring. I edited my review because I wanted to warn future shoppers what happened to my ring.

THIS LAST EDIT is to give thanks to this company for their great customer service. After the negative (edited) review, they were kind enough to replace the broken ring FREE OF CHARGE. Thanks!"
5.0,"this is a great promise ring, i bought it for my self b/c i love rings like this, but can def. be used as a promise ring just like it says:)"
5.0,"The ring was not exactly as I imagined it to be.  The picture made the stone look like it has a purple tint to it.  The stone is completely colorless.  The band is a little daintier than I thought it would be as well, but it doesn't matter if you have slender fingers.  The person I got this for loves it so I'm very happy with this ring."
5.0,"Will this ring last 100 years? I'm not completely sure, but it sure is a great deal for its price. It's beautiful, and let me give a gift to my fiancee that didn't break the bank. Since we are experiencing intense family drama, often centered around money and the lust for more, we like that it's a cheap and powerful signal to certain people that we can see real beauty beyond dollar signs. She loves it. :)"
3.0,"This is a beautiful ring- I had it as a purity ring for about a year and got many compliments on it!  However, it is frankly pretty cheap.  The metal soon got bent out of shape, and the CZ fell out after a year.  I really enjoyed it while it lasted though- it was only $10 so I wasn't expecting too much.  In short, its a gorgeous ring- but don't expect it to last too long!"
4.0,"I may not be too ken into these kinds of things, but when the name of the ring is ""Marvelous"" it really is marvelous; it is definitely a very nice gift to give to a girl. Not THE perfect ring, but does a very good job of doing whatever job you want it to make.

The thickness of the ring seem just right, which doesn't make it uncomfortable to wear, and the width of the ring is not annoying-sized as you would see in some other rings. The design also is very simple yet not bothersome to the eyes (although in the contrary, very smooth surface and a pretty neat design); it doesn't stand out too much either, which is good in my opinion."
5.0,"I absolutely love this ring. It is so delicate and pretty! I've worn this ring daily since I got it, and it's in great shape. The little boxes the rings from this seller are sent in are precious!

Definitely a great value."
4.0,"I bought this ring from Amazon over a year ago.  It is still pretty, although very slightly worn out - as it usually happens with low-cost silver.
It am satisfied and I would buy it again.

The worst review here claims that this made her finger turn green and it bent within a week.  NOTHING like that happened to me.
Sterling silver is 7.5 percent copper which can turn green, and some people seem to have body chemistry that's prone to staining. This happens if a person is on the ""sweaty"" side and has a natural high acidity level. Another reason may be reaction  with lotions and some chemicals."
5.0,"I have had this ring for over two weeks now and it is still just as beautiful as it was the first day.  I have received many compliments about it and I often find myself admiring it.

I also appreciated the fast shipping.  It arrived on the first day of the estimated shipping dates.  Great product, great company!"
5.0,"My wife was hinting to wanting a new ring. I searched online and in jewelery stores for something that i thought she'd like. After weeks of looking, I was looking on amazon.com for something for myself, and some how came across this ring. It was perfect. The right price and everything. The shipment was sent immediately. I can't wait to do business with Gem Avenue again."
4.0,"Bello anillo que va con la persona que lo adquierio
""pequeo pero como brilla!!!"" jajaja
Gracias"
5.0,"I enjoy the casual comfort of this ring, and would suggest it anyone who enjoys lightweight jewelery, along with more expensive appearance."
5.0,"I hate being solicited for reviews, which I was by the seller once I received the ring, but I must say it is a good ring. The ring looks just as it does online, if not better. The cubic zirconia is cut just right and it is supersparkly and passes pretty well for a real diamond from afar. It seems pretty sturdy to me -- I have been wearing it for the last week and I am not a gentle person. The stone has stayed in place and so far, repeated washing of my hands with the ring on hasn't caused any problems. My finger has not turned green, and this ring is a cute little thing good for wimpy little fingers like my own. The price is great, and I would definitely recommend it. I'm a miser with my money and so I think this was the perfect purchase and it was well worth the small cost. I have no regrets."
4.0,"The ring is what I thought it would be...beautiful.  The only drawback for me is that the band bends easily.  This ring has a unique shape to it that has drawn compliments from friends.  Regardless, I would recommend this to others."
5.0,"Simple, pretty, and cheap.
I bought it for myself and I'm very glad I did. :)"
1.0,"I have had this ring for 2 weeks, of which I have worn it about 4 days.  There is no way this ring is sterling silver.  After the first day of wear, my finger turned green.  After the fourth day, it appeared so tarnished it was ridiculous and the ring has totally bent.  I almost couldn't get it off my finger it is so misshapen.  And before anyone asks, no I didn't wear it doing anything that would have caused it to bend.  I sit at a desk all day and type for my job and I am usually on the computer most of the night at home.  I wear tons of sterling silver rings and I have never had such a bad experience with one.  Yes, the ring is very cute, but it is inexpensive for a reason... it will last about  a week."
5.0,"I got exactly what the picture looks like.  It is of good quality.  I have been showering with it and it has not turned my finger green, which means it is real silver.  It was shipped quickly as well."
5.0,I bought this ring as a present and the person who received it absolutely loves it. It is very pretty and an excellent value.
4.0,"I purchased this ring because I am interested in a similar style engagement ring setting. I wanted to see in person how it would look. It is a very elegant looking, dainty ring. The stone is a little loose but that is to be expected with the type of setting and the overall look you want from this ring. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,i was very happy with this ring it was exactly as the discription said. i would definatly recomend it.
4.0,"I am no expert on rings, but the Zirconia looks kinda flat.  Are these things supposed to look like diamonds?  It is good quality though.  Didn't know what the ""Promise ring"" stood for, so there was some rather awkward explanations when giving it to my gf.  worth $20"
2.0,"I had a little shipping problem(no fault of the seller) and waited a long time for this ring.  I was disappointed when I opened the box. It looks cheap to me.  The setting for the stone is cheapo...not the band, but the metal the stone is actually set in. I've had it 2 years and have only worn it twice. It may work for a teenager. The band itself is nice and the stone size is small, just the way I wanted it. It has never tarnished. I know it was inexpensive, but it looks that way too....at least to me.  Gem Avenue does sell some of the best snake chains I have ever seen in sterling.  They are very durable and require little cleaning and they do not tarnish...period.  I had mine for 2 years  and wear them often.  They are inexpensive, but very well made and good looking."
1.0,"I liked it, until the stone fell out. If you look at how the ring is constructed, the stone is just sitting between the two metal arms. That mean if one gets twisted or pulled, out goes the stone.

It wasn't worth the money to send it back.

I guess you get what you pay for."
5.0,"This is a beautiful little ring. I bought it for my girl friend as a nice present. Small, simplistic, inexpensive yet elegant-appearing is what I wanted and that is what I got. This is the perfect ring for someone who works a lot since it wouldn't be a big deal it they broke or lost it."
5.0,I bought a number of rings from you & every one was beautiful not all of them were for myself but the ones that were fit perfectly loved them thank you
5.0,"This ring may be on the ""cost effective"" side of things, but it doesn't matter: it is beautiful.  The thin band is very comfortable, and the cubic zirconia is exactly the right size and shape for this setting.  I think this is a ring that any girl would love.  It works well as a promise ring, a ""thinking about you a lot"" ring, or just an ""I still like you"" ring.  The price is low, but with a ring this pretty, it really doesn't matter."
5.0,"This is a nice ring...my sister got it for Christmas and she loves it!

<a target=""_blank"" href=""[...]""></a>"
5.0,I was very please not only with the service I received but the ring itself. It is beautiful! I am very please and would recommend it to anyone!
5.0,I bought this ring for one of my female friends.  It was shipped and I arrived it 4 days before they said it would be there and when I opened the package the ring was breathtaking.  Awesome service fast delivery would defiantly buy from again.
5.0,This rign is really nice. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. It arrived quickly and safely and it even came in a neat little gift box.
5.0,I was very happy with the service and the product.  I received my ring very quickly.  The ring is beautiful.  Everyone that sees it makes some comment about it and wants to know where I got it.  I plan on making future purchases with Gem Avenue!
5.0,The ring was very beautiful...i thought the price might mean the ring would look cheap but it doesnt at all...its a great product for the price and the company was amazing to work with..
5.0,These are very pretty earrings that catch the light and sparkle.
3.0,"The waist and length are just right.  I wear a 34W 32L pant size and the thigh area is diffucult to pull up to where it needs to be.  I am by no means thick around the thighs.  If I ordered a larger size, I would have excess in the waist and in the length, so pick your poison.  Otherwise a good value and high quality product."
4.0,"The only gripe I have about these chaps is the buckle...it is the only cheap part of the chaps.  Other than that, the rest is great.  The leather is thick, the zipper is strong and stitched well, and the snaps are rugged."
4.0,Nice leather
1.0,I have already submitted review.....I returned them...was not satisfied at all
3.0,okay quality.
4.0,Good sexy time usage.
5.0,Love em
5.0,Great fit and great price.
5.0,"these are retailed at $120 dollars and they are really made well, this deal can't be beat"
1.0,"Junk faux leather. There is a bit of leather at the bottoms around the snaps. Other than that it is fake and cheap, patched together scraps with glue and thread. It is not as advertised. It would offer as much protection as a pair of jeans at best. Even the buckle is weak, almost like plastic. Any biker would be disappointed in these."
4.0,Took awhile to get here but were worth it!
4.0,"For the price cannot be beat.  A good set for spring, summer rides."
3.0,I have a pair that are size small n these are extra large they fit about the same I haven't worn them just tryed on not shure what I'm gona do with them now
3.0,"Cheap leather chaps, fit as expected but product details aren't the best (one leg is missing the button to close the it properly, zippers don't look extremely solid) Wouldn't recommend it for actual use on motorcycle but okay for a costume party for instance"
3.0,A little to large but good leather chaps
1.0,"These are the cheapest, crapiest chaps I have ever seen. They look like they are for a Halloween costume. Unlike the picture here they have a square buckle to injure you!"
5.0,THANKS
3.0,Zipper came off the left side
3.0,If I can exchange for xl I'll be happy
5.0,Fits great for the waist the thighs are a bit tight hoping they will stretch
1.0,The product was returned. The seam tore.
5.0,Fits good!
5.0,"quality is just what you should expect for the great price, I had a small issue and the customer service was exceptional."
5.0,"love these chaps,,, just what i thought they would be"
5.0,Very Nice
4.0,"Quality is alright, service not helpful to change size"
3.0,Liked oroduct
4.0,like them I will order a smaller size next time
1.0,The leather is very cheap and the buckle is very very cheap... I used it one and the paint was coming of and the leather stretched so it fit loose after the first use. The leather was very thin and made of small peace's of leather... just now a good product.
1.0,These are junk. Supper thin cheap leather...? product. The best thing about these chaps is the leg zippers. They are the highest quality item on the chaps. And that ain't sayin much ! The buckle reminds me of a child's Halloween costume. I would be embarrassed to give these away even to someone I don't like. Whatever they used to dye the material burned off on my pipes. NOT TO HAPPY ABOUT THAT! Do not waste your money.
3.0,The zipper started coming lose on the third day of a 12 day trip.  After 6 days the finish on the leather at the bottom of the legs started to peel off and lather cracks appeared.  Medium Size was a little tight in the legs and to big in the wast.
4.0,Thinner than expected
5.0,took a long time to ship but great product
3.0,It's ok for the price
5.0,the chaps are the best investment that i have bought yet. went for a ride yesterday and glad we wore them. it was cold riding and they saved our legs from freezing.
4.0,"Especially when you consider the amount of money spent, these are pretty good. They look nice enough and I haven't had any problem with the zippers or snaps. As for the size, it seemed right on."
1.0,"My wife ordered me these ""chaps"" so I could enjoy the last few days of riding for the year. When they got here, the ""fabric"" (NOT LEATHER) had color coming off of it. The seams were also coming apart when I opened the package. I know you get what you pay for, and can't expect great chaps for $30, but the chaps should at least be leather if that is what the description said. If anyone is even thinking about ordering these, don't waste your time, money, or effort. You will just be upset by the ""quality"" (HA HA HA) of this item. I hope I saved at least one person from making a very big mistake. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!  ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!"
3.0,Fits snug around the legs. Can't see how it would have fit me had I purchase a smaller one being as I am on the first notch on the belt. I would have to make my own hole to make it tighter.
3.0,"I bought these for my sister and I.  We were very excited about them coming in the mail.  Upon arrival we were very pleased with the chaps, nicely made but alas they were too small.  I'm in the process now of returning them and will be ordering the next size up."
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for. The buckle is as cheap as they come and the sizing is off.

I measured my thighs with jeans on and they were 1/2"" smaller than the high range of the size I ordered. The chaps came in and they stopped about 3/4 of the way up my thigh. The zipper starts at the bottom so there was no way to get any additional slack. I got the chaps a day before leaving on an extended vacation and didn't try them on until returning home. By that time, my window for returning them had elapsed. I now have chaps that I will only be able to wear if I loose some weight."
4.0,I am very satisfied with the product.  I did notice that the belt buckle was a bit cheap but overall the product is great.
1.0,I hoped to wear these chaps for a Halloween costume and the sticking was falling apart from the start.  I am going to have to buy a new set or do a lot of repair to make them last one night.  I would NEVER wear these on a motorcycle.  If the leather and stitching can't hold up to my living room they won't do anything in a crash.
4.0,"The mens V-Creeper 509 is a surprisingly comfortable shoe. I owned 2 pair back in my punk/goth youth (yes, the 80's) and as much as I loved them back then, they were never that comfortable. The quality of the shoe its self Im finding to be top notch as well. So, if you're a youngster or an old geezer like me...do yourself a favor, and getchya some of these creepers."
4.0,"These Shoes would have been awesome, I wear a size 10, but the size 10's in these shoes did not fit me. It would be nice if they would offer a 7.5 Thanks anyways!"
5.0,"Well, this is the first time I've ever bought shoes online and I suppose it's always a gamble, as far as getting the right size is concerned. Luckily, I took a look at Demonia's website and I read that they say that people who haven't bought Demonia shoes before should know that most people find that they have to take one size larger than their usual size. So, I ordered one size larger than what I usually wear and when the shoes arrived they fitted me perfectly.

Otherwise, the shoes also look great and are surprisingly, very comfortable. They look and feel tough, like they'll last for a long time. I wanted slip-on creepers and these were the only slip-on Demonia creepers I could find. The detail is also cool. I hope Demonia design other, better men's/unisex creepers, though, as I would like to buy another pair or two but their other creeper designs are somewhat cheesy, in my opinion.

All round, thumbs up!"
5.0,"I received my men's V creeper 509 today and was blown away! The service and quality I experienced was superb. The customer service rep was fantastic ! I will definitely buy another pair of shoes in the immediate future.

Thank you"

5.0,This is a great product.  I like the illuminating hands of the watch and the protective cover.
2.0,"I wasn't expecting too much watch for this price but from the other reviews I thought I'd be getting at least a good deal. I was wrong.

When you pop out to set the time, the minute hand flops around a teenie bit so when you set the time you have to be careful how you click the set knob back in or it can move the minute hand a little. Not very accurate and really annoying to me.

However, yes, it's fine for the price I guess but I'm now looking for another pocket watch. It's not worth it for me to send it back so I'm donating it to a thrift store and spending more money this time for something with a bit more quality."
2.0,"The face of the watch moves around when you change the time. I also found the stem would pop up while it is in my pocket. That allows the time to stop. The chain is cool, but the craftsmanship is clearly sub par. It is real light and obviously cheap."
4.0,"this is a gorgeous pocketwatch, the brushed exterior and the swirled interior of the case are a nice touch, and the face of the watch is simple and functional.  my only gripe would be the chain. it broke off the watch after about a week, cheap metal and latch.  not that big of a deal, as usually just keep the watch in my pocket anyways.  good watch, would definitely buy this again."
4.0,"A simple and elegant pocket watch, simply put. I was a bit concerned before i made my purchase, as they do not show what the cover or its inside looks like, or even a good enough close up of the face. I was more than satisfied when i actually had it in my hands.

The inside of the cover is like brushed steel, with circle patterns and the face looked nice and simple, with a second hand. The numbers were easy to read and included military time in smaller red font beneath it, as well as minute conversion in small black just above them. It made it easy to tell the time at a glance.

My only qualm is the chain isn't a little bit longer and doesn't have a replaceable clip at the end."
5.0,What more could you ask? Great price. Large readable face. Stylish. Second hand. Easy to set. Get one and start a retro trend in your area.
4.0,"This was such a great buy for me. I used wear a heavy watch on my wrist and it would get in the way of my typing and other things. This pocket watch took all of that trouble away. It's a great product, and the price if outstanding."
5.0,"I just received this beauty and WOW! I coupled this with some stackable cz and tanzanite rings and I must say, I couldn't BELIEVE how real and gorgeous it looks! WHAT A GREAT DEAL! Definitely recommend it for those of us who love the look and can't afford the real thing."
4.0,"I bought this ring recently and the stone and setting is gorgeous! The ONLY thing that I don't like it the flatter shape band. I like a raised band on a solitaire but that is a personal preference and in no way reflects the quality of the item. For the price, I would highly recommend!!"
4.0,I really like this buckle and it adds another dimension to my wardrobe.  Well made and generates discussion.  A good addition to one's wardrobe if you use detachable buckles.
5.0,"This buckle is hot!!!  This design although popular makes a very unique statement. It is made of a great quality pewter, so it is durable and qualitative. On the back of this buckle there is sticker that says,

""This is not a toy."" The points on the sides that make the cross are wicked sharp! Not sharp like a blade, but, if the right pressure is applied, it could cause harm.  So be careful.  This buckle, although small can work for any style or personality.  Get it, you'll love it!!!"
5.0,"The bag is comfortable to wear, watertight, and has bunch of compartments to hold your stuff. I especially like the two front side zippered pockets, very convenient. The main compartment has a pocket that will fit a 13"" computer, though it can accommodate a larger one simply by putting it in the main compartment (duh). Jansport bags are usually very good, and this one is not exception."
5.0,"This bag is very spacious and holds a lot of stuff, enough that I can even use it as a weekender bag when I'm not using it as a daily book bag.  For anyone who, like I did before buying this bag, wonders whether it's suitable for laptop storage, the main compartment has what the manufacturer describes simply as a ""divider,"" but which is padded on all sides, so it makes for a serviceable laptop sleeve.  The bag has an ample number of intelligently-designed pockets for keeping organized everything from little stuff like pens and post-it notes and such, to mid-sized pockets suitable for holding items about the size of a paperback.  It has an elasticized mesh side pocket that offers quick and easy (i.e., unzippered) access to stuff like a water bottle, a small umbrella, mp3 player, cell phone, keys, etc..  The ballistic nylon is seemingly indestructible - it has successfully resisted a number of attacks from my springer spaniel - and sheds rain easily.  All in all, a very versatile, dependable, and well-thought out bag."
4.0,"I had an older messenger bag from Jansport that i unfortunaltey lost along the way. This seemed to be a suitable replacement. It is a little large for my tastes. I guess they make adequate space for a laptop, but I don't need it for that, for the most part. Pockets are certainly big, the grab handge is a little narrow, and thin. A little more color would be nice, because it is all black, with the exception of the logo being outlined in red. other than those minor complaints, i do like it."
3.0,"This is a roomy, well-made and sturdy bag - my big gripe with it is that there is no handle, just the shoulder strap.  For some reason, there is a thin, flimsy strap at the top which looks like it could be used to hang the empty bag on a coat hook.  I don't see the point.  I like this bag, but assumed it would have a standard handle like all of the other messenger-type bags I've owned.  Makes it diffifult to carry at times."
4.0,"I bought this bag for the Jansport name, which, as a student and a teacher, I trust.  I intend to use this bag for a trip across Europe, then to use it as a laptop bag.

Good points:
-the Jansport name and guarantee.
-Water bottle holder on one side of the bag (great for me in Europe, and a key factor for me buying this bag)
-decent, if not great, laptop protection
-good size--can hold a lot of stuff or a little bit of stuff without losing shape or look
-comfortable to wear on shoulder or across body
-good length of strap (and it's adjustable)

Bad points:
-the flap is held down by two small, unadjustable latches.  I've found them difficult to use one-handed, and they just seem flimsy.  I'd much rather have one heavy-duty latch.
-The shoulder padding is a bit awkward...but it can be removed, and I think it will improve as I break the bag in.
-The smaller pockets in the front are not that great in design.  If you lift the flap, there are three pockets in the front of the bag.  (There's also a large zip pocket in the flap, which is good for easy access.)  Anyway, the center pocket is OK...nothing too fancy, but a zip front and requisite card holders, key holder, etc.  Above this, there are two narrow pockets that are a few inches wide and go down the whole front of the bag (thing a tall, thin rectangle behind the main front pocket on either side).  These pockets are pretty much useless to me...they're too thin for much stuff, and they're awkward to get to for easy access.
-The material seems thin.  However, since this is a Jansport bag, I'm trusting it will hold up."
2.0,I think that I was misled by the picture that was posted on the website because I don't think the bag that I received looked like the picture.
5.0,"This bag is absolutely perfect!  I keep my 14.1"" laptop, usb mouse, battery charger, palm pilot, palm pilot keyboard and random paperwork in this bag, and it is NOT overstuffed!  Everything important for my daily travels fits in this bag, and still looks stylish with the slim fit pockets!

There is a wide foam pad that I lay my laptop against, and I have nothing to worry about as I carry it along while shooting pictures.

The construction is the best, but then again, it is a Jansport, so you should already know that you have nothing to worry about in that department.

I would highly recommend this bag for laptop and business paperwork carrying."
4.0,Nice  bag for work or school. Many pockets for storage and easy to carry.
5.0,This bag is awesom!  Was exactly what we were hoping it would be.  Would definately recommend this product.
5.0,This backpack is extremely well made and has a compartment for everything that I need one for.  It is spacious and easy to get in and out of.  I love the way the straps can be shortened or lengthened to provide a comfortable fit.  Excellent product.
5.0,Got here fast was what I expected
5.0,Can hold a lot of things
5.0,great product....
5.0,"got for granddaughter, she loved it"
5.0,i love this bag. very durable.
5.0,ok
5.0,I've had this about two years and use it daily for my train commute.  Shows a little wear but still going strong.
5.0,Great bag.. very cheap and worth the money
5.0,Excellent...
5.0,I used to have one like this about 7 years ago! Great quality !! I bought a new one!!
2.0,"Didn't like bag. Too big for me,felt cheap, and the strap was weird. Sent it back"
2.0,This bag is huge - I returned it.
5.0,The only but i have is that is very big. but i love my bag. Good quality.
5.0,Very practical and can fit a 17' laptop easily.
5.0,"I was hesitant with the price of this bag, but now that I have and have been using it I don't regret it at all. It holds EVERYTHING. There are a lot of separate pockets under the main flap so I can organize things. I've been using it for months and it still looks brand new."
3.0,Bag was large and roomy. Just what I needed for all my teaching supplies.
5.0,"I love it! It's super cute and very roomy. My have a 15.6 inch laptop and it doesn't fit into the 15 inch laptop slot inside, but it doesn't matter because I have a laptop case. This is a great bag and I will recommend it to anyone."
3.0,"It's a bag. Could feel sturdier. So far, it is surviving Manhattan. Not complaining yet."
4.0,"I purchased this bag for a high school girl. She chose it after viewing many bags on Amazon.  She prefers the messenger styled bag over the traditional backpack. She initially rated it five stars  but decided on four because the pad on the shoulder strap is always moving out of place, causing the strap to hurt her shoulder when full.  Other than that, she loves that it is very roomy.  She especially appreciates the two side pockets that can fit her PE clothes. The water bottle holder is very handy. With so many pockets it was easy to organize and set up an efficient system to stow all of her belongings."
5.0,"Daughter loves it.  She prefers the way it feels and carries vs a backpack, and it's very stylish"
5.0,"Great bag, just what I needed."
5.0,My son loves this bag! It holds 3 textbooks and 1 2inch binder.
5.0,I Love this bag. This is the 3rd JanSport Messenger bag I have purchased over the last 10 years. Lots of pockets and space for my needs!
5.0,"I bought this messenger bag years ago and it's been used, washed, used again, washed again etc. it still looks good and my husband still uses it every day. It has outer and inner front pockets in the flap. The inner pockets are great for storing sandwiches and other flat items while the outer pocket is accessed by the zipper that runs across the flap. I guess the main quality of this bag is it's great durability. The shoulder strap is ok comfortwise but not great."
4.0,Very bright and bold. A huge bag
5.0,"Fits everything, great quality, durable, feels good on both full or empty.  Very happy with this backpack"
3.0,Get's the job done.
5.0,excellent quality
5.0,"I bought this for my son and he has made good use of it  carrying his college books.  It is well made and durable yet light weight.  The strap is comfortable for him.  He rides public transportation to school, so he needs a durable bag that will hold up well. This bag does the job."
5.0,"my wife loves it. She asked me for a bag, i searched a lot and she is very happy with !!!"
5.0,"Okay I just made this purchase, but so far it fits my needs. I'm a college student and I can fit my laptop and books inside the main compartment. The bag as 4 nice compartments. It seems pretty well constructed. I can place the bag in different places. I replace a backpack which was also awesome. But on campus, walking down the halls or in bathroom it seems like backpack world so I'd rather have a messenger bag that fits all my needs and reduces the amount of space you need while walking from class to class."
4.0,My only issue with this bag is that that the '15 laptop sleeve is very tight. I have to force my '15 laptop into the sleeve and struggle to get it out. Very misleading on that feature.
4.0,"Material is not as beautiful pictures, this messenger bag is a little big, a little soft, can't put a lot of weight."
5.0,"Holds everything I need.
Netbook, notebook, hoody, plus a little extra room.

I was looking for something in the medium range and this works well.
The laptop sleeve is really a sleeve, and doesn't have any padding. Which was good for me as I didn't want a lot of extra fluff in the bag"
2.0,Very cheap feeling. Material is very thin and saggy. Holds no structure. Spend the money on something of better quality.
3.0,not much to it.....picture makes it look padded and sturdy.  The actual back is like a shopping bag with zippers.  I wish it had more padding
5.0,"Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly I stand by them 100%!!!!!!
I am very happy and so are those I bought them for!!!"
5.0,"The bag was purchased to carry bookeeping stuff and supplies. Jansport always excels in storage bags!!!

I would buy again"
5.0,"I searched for weeks for a go bag and I'm so glad I found the Jansport messenger bag. At first I thought it was too big, but it is a messenger bag, I was toying with the idea of returning it,I'm glad I didn't because the room was needed over time. I love the various compartments and as one can vouch you start to carry more items with you daily when you have room, Ipad, cell, books.......so I would have regretted returning it. One thing that can be improved is the strap not tangling."
4.0,"Well, the bag is great, has too many compartments, I like the color but I think the quality of the material was made is lower than I thought, I feel like the bag could be damaged if I only put it on the floor. I will hope to see if I was wrong, but I think in general is OK!"
5.0,"This is hands down the best messenger bag on the planet.
Period.

Inside Pocket for up to 15'' Laptops and plenty of comparments.
Side pocket for your Cooler.

Forget about Timbuk2. No way i'm  going to pay $200 for a bag. NEVER."
5.0,I love the bag. It was every thing I need. Plenty of pockets. Love it. Love love it. Very much
5.0,"I bought this tote for school. I have used it for a long time and it works great! It is a very nice size and is comfortable to carry around on my shoulder. I picked the white and pink bag, but it gets dirty. I take everything out of it and put it on a delicate cycle to wash and it looks nice and clean again."
4.0,"Good quality. I use mine while commuting on the train to work. Big enough for books, magazines, my jacket, shoes, my yoga clothes and lunch box. Has lots of compartments and areas to stash things. Comfortable to wear while standing on a train."
4.0,Nice bag. I like it. Durable too. Hope to buy one for my brother in future. Easy to move around with.
4.0,I use this for work and for dance. It carries a lot of stuff without feeling too bulky or hurting my shoulder. would recommend this for any professional
4.0,"Its very light, roomy and comfortable. there are lots of pockets and the design is very nice too. good purchas."
4.0,"I'm a cellist, and I'm getting tired of the bag I've been using, so I'm looking for a replacement. This Jansport bag was good, but it was too big. Still looking."
5.0,I have bought a JanSport backpack before but this is a great messenger bag!! It has pockets for everything. I like the small pockets on both sides. I put pencils pens on one side and I am able to put the charger to my computer and my wireless mouse in the other one. It has another pocket in the front for other things. It fits my laptop and a couple of notebooks....it was worth the buy!!!
4.0,"I used to own this bag in the lavender/purple color but gave it away because it wasn't the most professional looking bag (although I regret it because the color was so cute). When I realized I needed a new bag I went looking for the purple one I had and then realized it was gone. Immediatley I wanted to order the same bag as it is comfortable, has adjustable straps and easily carries a ton of stuff. I keep my work laptop in it as well as my wallet, makeup bag, books, notebooks, and pens for grad school. And after all of that, there is still enough room for more. The black and gray colors of the bag I recently purchased look professional yet young and trendy at the same time. I would recommend this bag for anybody junior high and up to adult hood. Even though amazon doesnt have a wide color selection, I know that this Jansport model comes in multiple color combinations. Buy it. You won't regret it!"
5.0,"I love this brand.  This was bought as a replacement for my son, not because it wore out, he just grew tired of his old one and wanted a new one.  BTW i bought his old one when he was in the eighth grade , and this one his first year of college."
5.0,I use my bag for work.  I need to carry a lot of things and they all fit.  Also easy on the eyes
2.0,While this bag is made from quality materials the stitching was loose on the strap and it was evident that it would not endure the use under weight. This may not be the norm for this product. I returned the bag and did not re-order the same bag.
4.0,Nice messenger bag for my daughter who is a college student. I thought it was king of big for a crossover bag but I know it will hold her books well. and Jansport will last her a long time.worth the investment
4.0,"Bag was much larger than expected. Will fit 21"" laptop easily and all cables. Not quite the messenger bag that I was expecting,  more of a laptop bag. Still it was well made and sturdy."
4.0,"I work in several schools and bought this bag to carry materials with me.  I love the many pockets and water bottle holder.  It is also comfortable to wear.  It is a very good size, almost too big for my needs, but overall I am pleased."
5.0,This bag has ample storage space and pockets. It is constructed out of very high quality materials and has definitely served it's purpose.
5.0,"Very durable. I've had mine for almost a year now; it got me through a semester of school, carring everything from my laptop to books. Plus its a good overnight bag if I go spend the night away from home. I literally use it for everything, and it still looks like new. Couldn't imagine what I'd do without it."
4.0,"it was a gift, but my missionary son said it is a nice size and is working for him-he likes the water bottle holder on the side, so I am guessing 4-5 stars."
5.0,I bought this messenger bag 3 years ago. Haven't had that much of a problem since then. Really great quality bag.
5.0,"I love this bag.  It allows me to carry everything I need to travel back and forth to work.  My purse, my lunch, my umbrella and my shoes all fit into one bag and by carrying it across my body I am able to have my hands free.  It is nice and durable."
2.0,"The bag was too big and I ended up returning it..  I was purchasing the bag for a trip overseas to use as a man purse an it was just huge.  The bag would work well as a weekend carry on bag, or large book bag."
5.0,It works for the purpose purchased.  The pockets are well placed; the zippers work; and carries everything my husband needs.
4.0,"After looking at quite a few reviews online, I decided this would be the perfect bag for me! I am currently studying ASL and so I have to take my current semester books and often books from other semesters to class with me. The size is great, the shoulder strap is comfy, the pockets are wonderful and the drink holder on the side fits my 20oz travel mug with no problems.

HOWEVER - I have a basic Toshiba 15.6"" laptop - IT DOES NOT FIT IN THE BUILT IN LAPTOP PADDED POCKET. I was pretty bummed. I almost returned it. Luckily, I had recently purchased a tight fitting slip lap top case and the bag is big enough that if you don't mind not using the pocket, the laptop fits. I recently took it to a study group with my lap top in a case, 2"" binder, 3 workbooks, a note book and my planner and everything fit just fine (along with quite a bit of things in the front pockets.

I had stupidly assumed that because my laptop is a fairly standard size and the bag got so many reviews about it's large size, my laptop would fit. If you don't take your laptop around with you often or if you have a smaller laptop (or a tablet), the bag is fantastic. If you plan on always having your standard or larger laptop in the bag, I would look elsewhere."
4.0,This bag is very well made. Large enough to carry everything I need to have with me. The straps are padded nicely so that it does not hurt your shoulder when you are carring it. Zippers are sturdy. Highly recommend this bag. The only thing I would change is a little extra padding in the interior pocket to better protect computer equipment.
5.0,"Just got this bag  and a week now and it is everything I had hoped for.  Very roomy and replaced a backpack I had. Wanted an over the shoulder bag but did not want to sacrifice a lot of room and this bag is perfect.  It is my work bag for lunch, computer, books, ipods... nice carryall!"
4.0,Excellent quality Very good on the whole even though my son says it is rather big ... could be a bit smaller for University use
4.0,"This bage is Huge!  It's light weight, fairly weatherproof, and holds weight well.  I would still be using it if my dog hadn't chewed through the inside lining to eat a lost boiled egg.  The lining is a little thin.  This would be a great carry on or weekend bag."
5.0,I need lots of pocket and a bag that makes use of every inch this product does just that and more  room for everything
5.0,So practical and great value!!!! I use it everyday and it's still in very good shape. Would recommend it for anyone who needs a backpack.
5.0,"PROS:
1. Many compartments inside and outside bag
2. Can be used for many purposes, as the material is very durable.
3. Minor wear-and-tear after three years of ownership
4. the shoulder pad is adjustable for all ages and sizes

CONS:
1. They should make more of these items for children, such as Walt Disney, as once this product is in the family, everyone is going to want one

RECOMMENDATION:
I recommend this product for anyone looking for a backpack, travel bag or utility bag. I use this bag for college, for work and when we go camping. It has really took it's fair share in beating and still stands it's ground. The material has not ripped in three years, and barely has minor wear and tear. This product by far receives a 5-Star rating. And for the price, its very affordable."
5.0,"Great Tote Bag, more like a messenger bag. I carry a bunch of gadgets and electronics for my work and this has more than enough compartments to keep my things organized."
4.0,"I am a female and I was looking for the perfect messenger bag for school..came across this bag and ordered it...looks are deceiving! It was so huge in person! I tried it on and I felt like a man! ugh..it makes women look manly/boyish and it is just too big...for men this bag would be great..if you are a woman I don't recommend this bag........

anywho Jansport rocks! and always will!"
1.0,"The bag falls over at every opportunity and is flimsy - made out of el-cheapo thin material.  It wouldn't last if it had to hold anything substantial.  It didn't fit my 17"" laptop inside the laptop protector, which if that is the point of purchasing a larger bag, the laptop should fit inside the protector.  It does not.  It shouldn't be advertised as a bag which would fit a 17"" laptop."
5.0,"Although I did not get the bag here, I got it a thrift shop for 3.00 and it still had tags, it's worth paying full price for.  I use it for my 14"" laptop among other things.  Well made and well designed.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,"Bought this for my Grandson after that debunkle of buying the Trailmaker and this one is no match.  My grandson loves this and he is the envy of his classmates. Great bag, great style, and great look!"
3.0,"I loved this bag (while I could use it!).  It's incredibly light-weight and has so many pockets, etc.  With normal everyday use to and from the office for less than a month, it ripped across the back.  I'm so bummed that I have to return it now because up until this point it was the best bag! :("
5.0,"This is perfect for college. It is durable and very roomy. You could fit your laptop and cables, along with a few textbooks. I'm very satisfied with the purchase. It's also arrived very quickly"
5.0,"This bag was a gift for a friend.  They let me know thy love this bag.  It holds everything.
Would buy again"
4.0,"Great looking Messager bag, great space inside. I am happy about the quality of work I could bring inside. I would not change anything about it."
4.0,"The picture of it must be at an angle, & filled with stuff, because it is HUGE in real life. Great if you're going to carry around a laptop &/or books constantly - but if you're not, might be a bit too big for a notebook & water bottle... I don't regret it, because I guess too much room is better than not enough - & it is really well made & has a lot of nifty pockets. All in all, pleased."
4.0,"Very good, very , lots of pockets
Lots of room, the shoulder strap took some adjusting, but managed to fix it."
2.0,"Would have sent this back after first use, but I got something on it.  I like things organized and this didn't work well for that at all.  Strap is terrible and uncomfortable, but since it is sewn on, you can't replace it.  Guess I'm just not a messenger bag kind of guy."
5.0,This bag meet my expectations and then some. I am able to load into it about 20lbs of stuff and it still holds its shape and doesnt show signs of distress. I love this bag.
5.0,It arrived within two days and it's the perfect size. Bigger than a regular size bag but not too big. It looks just like the picture and I am very pleased with this purchase.
3.0,"Great item but strap is already ripping, I guess it can be fixed, just not as durable as I thought"
5.0,"Bought this bag for my 12 year old Son. It had enough room to carry  his books ,notes and other supply.it aso has a side pouch to
Put a cold drink  thermos and most of all he like the feel and style of the bag .so far,its been holding well, craftmanships  of the bag seems well made..he luv it and some of his friends ask where he got it.."
4.0,"I needed a new bag that was smaller and had a strap.  The big issue with this bag is the laptop compartment! Maybe I missed the description but my 15.6 hp laptop will not fit in the laptop compartment which was a huge disappointment, but it worked out okay I instead put my iPad in there and I bought an extra neoprene sleeve for the laptop.  I need to be able to carry both for the program I am in and work.  In addition to a laptop and iPad, I need room for books and this bag is suitable for how many I carry.  The side pockets work great for cords!  Overall a decent bag, its a little thin and the strap connections concern me a little for how much weight it will hold but for 38 dollars I am satisfied with this buy."
5.0,"Bought this bag as a gift item.  The bag came earlier than expected, and the quality is just as expected so its a win win situation.  Being that its from Jansport we know its going to last."
4.0,"I love the bag, not too big, not too small... I only gave it 4 stars because it didn't provide measurements in the description so I had no way to determine if my laptop would fit in it... I brought this bag and my laptop both at the same time from Amazon and took the risk of it not fitting because it isn't that urgent that I take my laptop with me everywhere... I have a Gateway laptop that measures 15.02L by 9.96W according to the product info... It fits in the bag, just not in the laptop compartment... Its just barely too big to fit, maybe by half an inch, but it can fit in the bag so I'm not too worried... It's a very good quality bag though, exactly what you would expect from Jansport..."
4.0,This order was received very timely.  It is a gift for my grandson who will be using this as he heads off for his first year of college so he has not benefited from it at this time.  It looks like it will give him years of use.
5.0,"I purchased this Jansport messenger bag after years of using the standard strap backpack. Considering the amount of wear and tear that I gave the said backpack, it was in considerably good condition. Thus, when I decided to search for its replacement, I looked among the Jansport brand. When I saw this messenger bag's style, I was instantly attracted to it. After receiving it, I was pleased with its appearance and its functional pockets and compartments. The only downside to it is that the strap isn't well cushioned, making it a bit uncomfortable when carrying anything over 5 pounds. Overall, this messenger bag/tote is a great value for those interested in upgrading from a standard backpack."
4.0,"I've been using this bag for a couple of years now and as others have stated this is a pretty large bag which can be a pro or con. It has a sporty look and now I use it more as an overnight/gym bag than an office bag, but it served me well carrying around books and folders for years. While the storage space was nice, some parts of the bag haven't held up well. Within the first year the water bottle holder made of mesh broke. Also it doesn't have a true handle, rather a small strip attached to the back which you can use if you need to grab the bag quickly. This broke and it gets annoying when I just want to pick up and carry the bag briefly. Lastly this bag doesn't have much padding for laptops, and while it does have a compartment, I would recommend getting an additional sleeve.

Pros:
-Lots of space
-Versatile
-Durable main compartments

Cons:
-Might be too large for some people
-Water bottle holder broke
-Laptop compartment not very padded

Overall it's a good versatile bag, just be sure you're okay with the size."
5.0,"This bag is perfect. The layout of all the pockets and storage areas just ""makes sense"" and it has enough pockets to hold everything that I need. If I really fill it up to capacity, it is almost too heavy for me to carry - that's how much this bag can hold. I would definitely purchase this again, but hopefully mine will last a long time and I won't ever have to!"
2.0,"good bag. strong, roomy, and nice looking. but there's one problem. shoulder strap becomes twisted when used. the strap's attachment to the bag should have been able to rotate 360 degrees and not stationary. why this wasn't done is beyond me and thats why it received 2 stars. its a headache constantly straightening the strap out."
5.0,"the briefcase is very good, I liked very much and I received it in time. I highly recommend it, for it is completely waterproof and useful."
5.0,Just got my Jansport Elefunk Messenger bag and it is exactly what i was expecting it to be. I choose to go with Amazon Prime and got it shipped to be in two days. The bag over all is a little larger than i was expecting but it's great. I would recommend buying this bag.
5.0,"Speedy shipment! This Jansport Elefunk Tote bag is exactly what I needed to carry my text books in. I also love the many compartments it has, good for storing different items. It is exactly as described. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Been using for a week for morning commute and so far its fantastic. It's roomy enough to cary: a laptop, laptop power cable and mouse, large thermos, three ring binder, a portfolio, a thick book, and a box of Kashi bars all with some room to spare. The strap isn't fantastic and it usually starts to slide off of one shoulder so I wear it across my chest. Quality is good, it's sturdy and durable and so far nothing is fraying or coming appart. The style is nothing amazing but for $30 this bag has a lot of utility"
5.0,"Its just as said in the product description, Jansport does have very strong bags, so durability is a plus here. It looks great, its not too big, and fits my needs as I am on the go on a daily basis, lots of compartments for stuff. Would definitely recommend purchase of this item to anyone."
5.0,"It was a gift for my boyfriend, he needed a bag for school and couldn't find a good one at any store, so I purchased it at amazon and he loved it. It is a great bag!"
4.0,This was actually a gift for my roommate and she absolutely loves it! It is large enough for all of her school book and her laptop while not feeling too heavy to carry around. She was completely happy with her new bag!
5.0,"My 9 y.o. daughter was clear - she wanted a messenger bag, preferably in turquoise with at least 3 pockets.  This bag fit the bill perfectly!  It has 3 large pockets which all close with heavy-duty zippers.  The largest pocket is big enough to carry a 3-ring binder, lunch bag, several books, notebooks, folders and a jacket.  There are several smaller pockets internally for pencils, small notebooks, phones, etc.  The handle is broad enough to not twist easily and can be adjusted to fit shorter or longer bodies.  She has only used it for 3 weeks but so far, it seems like it will hold up well throughout the year and she loves it!  The bag we bought is mostly turquoise with a bit of white near the bottom.  It is not the plaid one shown in the photo."
5.0,Purchased for my eight grade daughter to carry her textbooks etc.  The Elefunk messenger bag is plenty roomy for her needs.  She did not want the traditional backpack and this bag fit the bill as it is nearly the same size as the Big Student backpack.
5.0,"Bag is very comfy, durable, sleek, nice, best quality messenger bag youll ever find! And the price is very affordable too! must buy product :) my friends loves the design and the style of it!"
5.0,The Jansport Messenger Bag is great. It is big and strong with plenty of compartments. It is the perfect tote for high school and all the school supplies that are required.
5.0,holds everything i need  love the water bottle holder.  5 stars. only problem is its a lil big but that could come in handy in the future
5.0,My son is brutal on messenger bags.  Previous bags begin to show wear after the first month.  This one is still holding up under the strain after three months.  I will repost at the end of the school year for a final review.
5.0,I have been very happy with the durability of these Jansport Elefunk totes.  Both my teenage boys use them as school backpacks.  These totes hold a lot and they stand up to abuse.
4.0,"great bag for carrying a few books, pens, medical equipment. very comfortable to wear over your shoulder, slim profile, looks like it will withstand lots of wear and tear like my previous Jansport backpacks."
5.0,"I bought this for my 12 year old son. He is very rough on things so i wanted something very study and spacious. He can fit his Trapper and several other school books, plus his reading books too. What is super nice is that JanSport has a lifetime warranty and they will fix or replace the product for free! Well worth the money."
5.0,Great bag! It came quick and in great packaging. Comfortable and with lots of space.
4.0,"It will hold a lot of books well enough, but starts hurting the shoulder after a long walk from the car to class. Durable and big- so that's a plus."
5.0,Great and durable...I purchased this about 2 years ago for college and I still have it now. When I received this item it was brand new. I definitely would buy from this seller again.
5.0,"I teach four courses so I carry a ton of stuff with me every day - books, notebooks, binders, etc - and it all fits in this bag with room to spare.  The padded shoulder strap is comfy even though the bag is heavy when full.  My only complaint is that the two buckles that secure the top flap are a little stiff but hopefully they will loosen up with use. I had originally wanted a briefcase (somewhat more professional looking) but they tend to be heavy even when empty and not as roomy or practical.  This one is light but sturdy, with room for everything. I would definitely recommend it."
4.0,"I was disappointed when I got this bag at first, primarily because it was huge! And it seemed like it wouldn't hold its shape.
After getting discouraged by Amazon's return policy, I decided to use it anyway. And I am so glad I did.
I have been using it to carry my gym clothes, office documents, lunch box, and am really happy with its performance and quality and guess what - it does hold its shape.

Would have loved to see more compartments (-1 star for this), but it isn't so bad the way it is right now."
3.0,"I originally got this bag about 6 years ago (in 2003). It was perfect, there were so many little pockets that you could organize everything you needed. Plus, it doesn't look huge, but it holds ALOT of stuff.

I purchased another one for my boyfriend recently (Fall 2008) b/c he was so in love with my bag. The design in generally the same, but the quality of the material has seriously deteriorated. You can tell the fabric is made of much cheaper stuff. The front zip pocket use to have a compartment to slide things into, but it now just sown directly onto the bag (eliminating a good partition in front pocket). There is also this tiny piece of fabric sown on as a 'handle' to use to carry it, but it's so feeble, it's not really much of an improvement.

If you didn't know what the old one was like, I'd still say it was a pretty good bag...nice colors options now too, but clearly cutting back on the quality of the materials and workmanship."
5.0,"I purchased this bag for my partner who is pursuing college. He absolutely loves this bag. There are a number of zippered compartments on the body of the bag. The front flap also has a small pocket for easy access externally which, is secured by clips that attach to the bottom of the bag. Beneath the flap is another zippered compartment that is very handy. It has a number of pockets, a key ring, among other areas to keep yourself organized, this zippered area provides a secure place to carry a  wallet or music player without having the worry of being pick-pocketed. We live in Chicago and this is a wonderful commuter bag as well. The strap has an adjustable pad for heavier loads as well as a padded back for wearing while biking. There is also a netted external pouch for bottles. The main compartment of the bag is secured by a long zipper that runs the length of the opening and also has a padded divider for occasionally transporting any size laptop. It was money well spent, as he'll be sure to use the bag for years to come. I hope this helps in your decision."
4.0,"This bag is durable, and big enough for books, and electronic items (cameras, chargers, extra batteries, and more). It fits perfectly around you when worn over your shoulder. However the handle on top is too small, and should be larger. It's a perfect ""Jack sack"". Best messenger bag I've had so far."
5.0,"I bought this for my son who was having trouble using a back pack. He has thanked us for it several times and says it is much better then using a back pack.
It arrived in good time and conditon."
5.0,I was very pleased with my purchase. The rings are beautiful and more than I expected for the price. I received my order very quickly and was very pleased with the service of this company. Great Buy!
5.0,"I took heed of the sizing issues described by the other buyers, so I ordered my ring a size smaller than normal and I have a perfect fit. Very beautiful rings and also very believable."
4.0,"For the price, they are great rings and can actually pass as real. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is becuase the seem to run maybe half a size to big."
5.0,I love this ring because it is believable that i could actually afford a diamond ring like this one and no one would think twice. The ring shines and sparkle beautifully. I've received more compliments than i anticipated. This ring is believable for the average working couple who's on a budget. Let's be real most of us on Amazon looking for a nice deal for our buck well this ring you can't go wrong for the price and on Amazon an upgrade is ssoooo easy to do when we're ready. Just think at these prices an upgrade can be done yearly. If you like change like i do this is an ideal way to purchase wedding rings. Spending 800-1000 on rings you stuck with the same look for years the average working Joe I'm speaking of. That same money i can change up at anytime and not feel guilty about money. The rings are beautiful and came so fast.
5.0,"Just received these rings and they are PERFECT (in size and clarity)! Way more than what I expected, they look like they cost a small fortune. Will definitely buy from this company again!!"
4.0,The ring itself is great for the money. The stones have a nice shine to them. There may be some manufacturer defects like mine arrived with a small chip on bottom of band and the center stone is set on a slant but nothing noticeable from a distance. The major problem that I've been having with ordering rings online is none so far measure true to size. I ordered size 8 the bag it came in even said size 8 but it measures at 19mm which is a size 9. I would definitely recommend this item to others just keep in mind you get what you pay for so don't expect something amazing. But i think this is worth the price.
5.0,This set is so beautiful I wear a size 7 and it is a perfect fit. The stones sparkle beautifully. I would recommend this company and I will order again from this company.
3.0,"I bought this ring on August 26, 2012. It looked just like the picture and if you didn't look too close it also looks real. Only problem is that it has already started to tarnish. I wash my hands with soap and water, take them off when I get home and put them up, but it still tarnished. I am sending it back."
4.0,"This ring looks real and expensive. What can I say it's $35 bucks and not $3,500. I'm sure my son-to-be fake wife will love it."
5.0,"Just got my ring today! Only took 3 days!! It comes in an adorable pink heart shaped box w/a ribbon tie on top. It is just as beautiful in person as it is on here! Looks exactly like the picture and fits perfectly! I am a size 5 and it fits perfectly! Both rings look so pretty paired together on the same finger also!
My friends don't know its not real, and i am getting plenty of very positive feedback! They love it!! I was gonna get a real ring when taxes come, but this is so beautiful, its not necessary!! You will NOT regret buying this ring!!"
5.0,"I purchased this set as a temporary replacement due to swelling during pregnancy. I have received multiple compliments on how pretty the ring is in general and comments of surprise to see ""my ring"" still fit on my finger so far into my pregnancy. It's definitely not obvious at first glance that this is not a genuine diamond ring. I followed the ring sizing chart and was not disappointed in the fit."
5.0,I am very happy with this ring set. I bought it as a temporary replacement for my wedding set since I'm pregnant and am having issues with swelling. I wear this set everyday and it fits great and is a good quality metal. I have not had any issues with the rings turning my fingers green like I did with a cheaper set I bought locally before I found this. I also received the product very quickly. It was scheduled to be delivered on June 3rd and I actually received it on the 1st. I definitely recommend buying from this seller!
1.0,"!!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
When I received this set, to say that I was disappointed, would be a gross understatement.  I was disgusted!  First of all, the ring was damaged/defective (whatever you want to call a mess up).  The center stone was improperly set and positioned within he prongs.  It was crooked.  And I assure you it was extremely obvious.  It didn't take any close inspection to see.  It was glaring.  Then the prongs themselves were also bent down in mismatched places on the stone, one being bent straight down the side edge of the stone vs. pointing relatively toward the center.  This only added to the overall impression of the stone being crooked.  It made the stone look as if IT were misshapen and cut wrong.

I get that you can't expect fake jewelry that costs $30 to be the same quality as the real deal... But this?  It looks like it came off the $5 carousel at walmart.  And frankly, I wouldn't have bought it from there, for that price.  It looks like crap.  It looks like a gumball machine ring, or something that could have come out of a little girl's dress up set.

Now, even had the prongs been set properly, etc. I still wouldn't have worn it.  That just added insult to injury.  The ring, had it been in perfect shape, still would have looked like something from the dollar store.  It doesn't look anymore ""real"" than a peice of glass stuck in a plastic band.  The silver even looks funny. It looks like tin foil. The reflective sheen is a dead give away.

The stones don't look like diamonds at all.  They don't even look like good immitations.  They look like cheap junk.

Also the center stone is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to large to be believable. On anybody.  It's about a 3-4 ct. stone.  It looks absurdly fake.  So unless you think that your friends might actually be able to bring themselves to believe that you could afford a $15,000.00 ring, then ummm yeah it'll be too big.

And if you can pull that off, then maybe you can also convince them that you know, all good metals are as shiny as tin foil, too.

Don't get this ring.  Don't waste your money.

BTW.. I found a beautiful, well crafted and believable ring for a little bit more $$$ (but still at a VERY decent price) at [...]"
5.0,"This ring is beautiful, understated, and elegant. Although, it may not be mistaken for the real thing upon close inspection,it is not so flashy that it screams fake. If you're looking for a replacement for the real thing, you just can't go wrong with this one(and the price is great too)."
5.0,This beautiful ring duo is absolutely stunning and very exquisite. When I put it on my jaw dropped it was gorgeous! I was very satisfied with this purchase. I have purchased rings before that have costed an arm and a leg that don't look this good!
5.0,"This ring is very beautiful. I have been wearing it daily at work, shower, cleaning etc and it still is in perfect condition and looks perfect. Great quality for the price. I was very pleasantly surprised. I have even had many compliments on it. This ring was definitly a great purchase."
5.0,"I love this set.  It is so realistic, I have purchased other sets and this is absolutely the best one.  I use this one for everday wear and receive so many compliments on my ""diamond"" set.  It is great.  Than you Gem Avenue for producing such great jewelry."
5.0,i am very impressed with my wedding and engagement ring. i couldn't have had anything better with the amount i paid for. its amazing that i got this to spice up my big day. i love it. good quality
4.0,"I bought these rings as a temporary wedding set until we have a little more money, and I have to say I am very pleased. I do have a few issues with them, mostly the engagement ring. On one side the band is straight where it connects to the center stone, and the other side is more curved. The center stone is a tiny bit crooked, but no one will really notice unless they are seriously studying it or if I point it out. Other than that the rings are gorgeous. Much nicer than I expected them to be. I have gotten so many compliments and a friend of mine didn't believe that they weren't real. The sizing was right on. Overall I am really happy with these rings and definitely would reccommend them!! :)"
5.0,I LOVE THE RING IT LOOKS GREAT I'M SO GLAD I HAVE IT NOW!! IT LOOK SOOOO GOOOOD IT WAS REALLY MORE THEN WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE...ME AND MY HUSBAND WANTED TO CUT SUM OF THE COST OF THE WEDDING AND WE BOTH GOT OUR RINGS ON THIS WEBSITE AND WE ARE GOING TO UPGRADE ON A LATER DATE... BUT EVERYBODY IS IN LOVE WITH BOTH OF OUR RINGS...THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA IF YOUR ON A BUDGET THAT WAY U DON'T GO INTO A UNION OWNING BILLS OFF DA GATE....
5.0,I bought these rings in a size up because I am pregnant and my other set doesn't fit anymore. These rings are beautiful...so worth the money. As far as the rings not looking real.....You can tell if you are looking very closely but most people can't tell the difference and that is including my husband!
4.0,"I bought this set as a replacement for when I sent my rings off for cleaning or sizing. It looks very similar to the set I have, however, up close, you can definitely tell that it's not real. Good price and decent quality for a replacement set if you are going on vacation or something and don't want to ruin your real set."
4.0,"We purchased this set to be my wedding set as we are low on cash and I did not want something expensive for fear of losing it, etc. This set is absolutely beautiful! I absolutely love the setting, and the cut of the CZ. To me, it doesn't scream fake, but if you get close to it and really want to analyze it, you will probably be able to tell its a CZ, although I think it sparkles and shines just as well or better than some diamonds personally. The only thing that I think could be a little better is that it could be a little more scratch resistant, but that could be the plating as I have had other sterling silver rings that weren't plated that didn't scratch as easily. Gem Avenue is a great seller and extremely helpful and quick in response time and shipment! I will buy from them again! if you are looking for a great looking set at a great price, this is your set!"
5.0,"After looking at rings for a wedding set for about 4 months I finally decided to purchase this set. I received them and they are perfect. Since they were such a cheap price I didn't expect them to be this nice. I wanted somethng that I could wear without having to worry about freaking out if I lost a stone out of one or banging them around when working. I am very picky, my husband says I have a little bit of OCD. I was concerened that the center stone would be to big and look fake or that the other stones would be so small you wouldn't be able to see them at all. I also was worrying about other issues that I had read about on reviews of other rings. The Size, the center stone being lose right out of the package, the stones turning black or quickly falling out. I had also read the review on this ring that said that there was a little gap between the rings because the center stone on the engagement ring was not set up high enough to let the rings nest together. So I was very anxious to actually receive the set in the mail and try them out for myself. They finally got here and I was VERY surprised to say the least. They were perfect. The stones were just the right size, not to small but not big enough they looked fake when showing people. The women at my work thought that they were real. All of the stones were secure in their settings and they are still just as sparkly now as when I took them out of the box. I wear a size 10 ring and its hard for me to find nice rings in my size. When I Took these out of the box and put them on they fit perfectly. There is a TINY gap between the rings but it is VERY TINY (so tiny I can't even think of anything that would fit in the gap between them, maybe you could get a VERY tiny knife blade between them but that s about it.) and not noticeable to anyone other than the wearer. I am VERY pleased with this purchase and I will be ordering from this seller again!"
5.0,I was truly surprised when I opened the pretty little silver box with the pink bow trimmed in silver and saw these rings! They are beautiful! And I haven't stopped smiling since. They give me joy every day! I have seen sets for a lot more money that didn't begin to compare with these. I ordered a size 5 and it was a perfect fit...I am very glad I decided to order these and I definately will be ordering again in the near future.
5.0,"It replace my wedding set, i use it every day.  Its beautifuL & perfect."
5.0,I saw this ring online and fell in love when I got it it was even more beautiful! I love it! not to big and not to small!!!
4.0,"I was looking for another ring to take the place of my lost wedding ring.  This ring was actually the second one I'd ordered, and I wish I'd seen this one first!!  The ring is beautiful.....!  I wanted something that would not look so gaudy, and this is the one!  I have small fingers and need something kinda small.  I wish the setting for the stone sat up a little higher, but it's still pretty on my finger.  My husband loves it!  There are small, unnoticeable flaws on the stones (i.e. a little separation between the stones).  Overall, I am absolutely pleased with my choice, and I have already recommended this manufacturer to my friends and relatives!!!"
4.0,"The rings are both very pretty and fit together nicely. If you look closely, the setting for the center ring looks cheaply made which gives the ring away as being fake, but for the price paid I think that is fair enough. On the upside, the smaller stones are very nice without any gaps, something I was a little worried about. Overall I'm very satisfied with the buy and it does not scream FAKE as some CZ rings do - the center stone is a nice size and the cz's used look nice. We will be putting off buying a ""real"" wedding set for a little longer since this set is so pretty and I like wearing it. The shipping was also fast and the company replied very quickly when I had a question."
2.0,"Upon opening this ring, I thought, ""wow, this is beautiful!"" And then I took it out of it's cute little box and my heart sank. It was lighter than air, and felt like it was made out of plastic. I wore it for the day, took it off that night, and realized that it was scratched where the stone on the engagement ring meets the wedding band.

I am sadly disappointed in this purchase. It was cheap, and now I know why. I was unsure of whether or not I actually wanted a fancy diamond wedding set, and this answered my question, at a very inexpensive price. I now know that the traditional wedding set is not for me. I'm glad I purchased this ring first before I purchased something far more expensive.

At a glance the ring is beautiful. If you don't mind feeling like you are wearing a plastic ring, then go for it. I for one need something a little more substantial and will be purchasing a Robert Lee Morris ring for my wedding ring."
2.0,"I have to say I was a little disappointed when I received this product.  I was looking for a temporary set while my wedding set was getting worked on and thought I would give this a shot since it had pretty good reviews.  I knew I wasn't getting diamond quality, obviously, but these rings look very fake even from an arm's distance away.  However, Gem Ave's service was very good and I received my product in a timely manner."
4.0,"I had to buy a replacement for my wedding set due to pregnancy swelling, and this item looked the closest I could find to my real set.  This is an excellent product for the money (2 rings!); however, if you look closely at the center stone you can tell it's not a real diamond (and really, how often does anyone but the wearer really look that closely?).  The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 was because the center stone should be set up higher to allow the two rings to nest.  Due to how the prong is set, there is a small gap between the rings when they are placed next to each other (again, something no one else but the wearer will notice)."
5.0,I have purchased from Gem Avenue prior to this purchase and have been very pleased with each purchase.  These rings are more stunning in person than in the photos for the ad.  They sparkle and shine no matter what I seem to get my hands into.  I haven't had any of the problems some of the others have mentioned other than the minor sizing problem which is easily fixable.  Gem Avenue is a great company to work with and will work with you until YOU are satisfied.  They have quick response to problems (I had a very minor one) and are very fast to attend to such errors.  I'll continue to be a happily satisfied customer.
4.0,"I received my rings well before when they were supposed to show up. The box that they come in is so cute. When I opened it and looked inside, the rings were even better than pictured online. They are very beautiful and the fit is perfect!"
5.0,"This is an absolutely gorgeous ring and is well worth the money!
The seller shipped promptly and the packaging made sure the ring was safe and secure. My daughter and her fiance are delighted with it as am I. I would recommend this product to anyone who deserves/desires a beautiful wedding set."
5.0,I did not have an issue at all with the sizing.  I wear a six and ordered that size in this ring and it fit perfectly.  This is a beautiful ring.  The diamond is not too big and not too small.  My original wedding set is yellow gold and I was looking for something that would go with the silver jewelry that I wear most often now.  Perfect addition to my collection. Would highly recommend.
5.0,This is a very beautiful ring set. The delivery was also quick. I ordered on Sunday and got them on Thursday!! I also ordered a size smaller and got a perfect fit! They are beautiful and for the price you don't have to worry about ruining them. People are surprised when i tell them how much I paid for them!!!
5.0,"I ordered these rings in size 5 and they were just right. I love them, they look very pretty, and after 1 month of wearing - even when I do the dishes - they haven't been tarnished a bit. Will buy again from GEM AVE."
3.0,"but if you order these with the expectation that they will pass for real diamonds, you will be disappointed.  They look like what they are, costume jewelry.  I rated them 3 stars because the prongs are not lined up perfectly and one is bent so I am going to return them.  If they weren't defective, I would probably keep them because they fit nicely (ordered them a size smaller than normal) and they seem comfortable."
4.0,The ring was very beautiful and worth the price.  The shipment arrived on time.
5.0,I had read all the reviews on this ring and did order a size smaller than what the size chart recommended. I am glad I did. It fits perfectly. This ring looks just like it does in the picture. It is very sparkly. It was shipped quickly after I ordered it. I am very pleased and will purchase from this company again.
5.0,I just got my set and I love them. They are the perfect size. The gem is just the right size not to big. Completely believable. Its better than I expected. It came in the cutest little gift box. I will deffinately order from this company again.
4.0,"The ring in itself is pretty. Although, it does look bigger in the picture.
I love the way it sparkles, bute the fitting is off. I tried over and over again with the sizing chart and I still ended up with the wrong ring size. So, I ended up buying a ring guard.
Overall, I was disappointed with the size of the gem and the fitting, but other than that it's pretty."
5.0,"The replacement window sets for my Rolf wallet are perfect - just what I was looking for.  The price was great, the shipping was fast, and purchasing was an easy transaction.  I will order again when I need new replacements."
2.0,"I was shopping specifically for Wonder Wallet insert replacements... these came up, but don't fit in Wallet... horizontal backing instead of parallel backing. Business Card protectors open on wrong side."
1.0,Started falling apart after 3 months. Not worth the price.
1.0,I bought 2 plastic insert folios and they both cracked and separated within 3 weeks of use.
1.0,"Very poor quality, the piece that holds it in place in the wallet began to tear almost immediately."
2.0,While the card pockets are adequately sized the insert leaf is very fragile and it detached from the main body within a week of use.
4.0,"It does what it is supposed to do, which is good. I was disappointed that all the cards don't load into the sleeves from the same side. The front half load from the back and the back half load from the front."
5.0,Works just fine in my wallet.
2.0,I ordered this as a Wonder wallet insert. It is not.

1.0,The insert is cheaply made. It has already broken down after just a couple of weeks and separated from the flap that holds it into the wallet.
5.0,"I've installed the replacement windows, and they work just fine."
1.0,These are junk.  The back tab to secure it to the wallet pocket tears in about two days.
5.0,good product
5.0,great
3.0,Very cheaply made.  One tore the insert before I ever got it in the wallet.  So far the other is ok as I as very careful with it.  Third one in in the package still.
5.0,These are an exact replacement for the windows in a Rolf credit card wallet. Good value.
5.0,"Great product, however a little $$$"
5.0,My wallet inserts wear out long before my wallets. Problem solved!

5.0,This is a quality product.  Its durable and holds up well.
5.0,nice
2.0,"Bought these replacement windows as the previsous windows I used had started to disintegrate.  The old ones lasted approx 18 months.  the new inserts lasted about a week before the plastic slide that hods the windows in the wallet tore and fell out of the wallet causing me to drop my credit cards, pictures etc.  Will not b purchasing again"
5.0,"Arrived as promised, work perfectly."
5.0,good
1.0,"If this is what I ordered, I didn't get 5 wallet inserts.  I got one that wouldn't fit any wallet I have."
5.0,Just what I needed to replace the worn out windows that came with my favorite wallet.
1.0,"The durability is nothing like a genuine Rolfs insert.  The locator tab that inserts into the wallet breaks off within a couple of weeks.  I ordered two and both of them have failed within a couple of weeks.  Again, I'm confident that these inserts are not genuine Rolfs.  My original Rolfs lasted for years."
3.0,"I purchased five of the (D) wallet inserts. The individual inserts for credit cards etc., are great. It is the extremely THIN plastic insert that goes in the wallet to hold the insert that is the problem.

I have only had the insert in a week and it already is cracking and breaking from the wallet insert. Fortunately, I can remedy the defect by reinforcing the THIN plastic seam with scotch tape on both sides of the wallet insert.

As I discard the complete insert, I will have to scotch tape a new wallet insert, so, it does not crack or break apart at the wallet seam.

I wish I would of ordered only one, but, the rest of the wallet insert is very good. To bad they did not make the insert seam more durable!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Terrible. Plastic flap that inserts into wallet tore off, yes tore off after less than 30 days of use. I want to request a refund."
1.0,Cheap junk. Not worth it.
5.0,This work great for organizing wallet. I have purchased these many times. I like the 2up style because it makes it easier and faster to flip thru and find the correct card.
5.0,very satisfied
2.0,"Sometime in the 1980's men's accessory shops were gone out of my Boston scene.  You know, the kind that sold nail clippers, shavers, wallets and ties. That made the search for essential accoutrements such as wallet inserts difficult.  Shopping Amazon isn't as personal and friendly but it fulfills the requirement.  Amazon is, if anything, comprehensive.  OH, WAIT:I gave this 5 stars before but 4 weeks later, I changed my mind.  The flap used to secure the insert into the wallet split allowing my cards and photos to fall out when I opened the wallet.  I had to secure it together with scotch tape. Originally the insert that came with the wallet wore out after several years of wear.  This is a cheap replacement.  poor quality, no quality control but i'm stuck with it.  any alternative?"
4.0,as advertised
2.0,"Since they changed the design to a rigid flap to insert in the wallet, the seam between the soft vinyl card pouches and the rigid vinyl tab tore within 1 week of the the insert being placed in service.  After a month, the only thing holding the card insert into the wallet is 1/4"" in the middle of the middle of the rigid tab.  While the flexible vinyl of the previous design eventually got folded and lost shapr in the tab area, it had lasted for several years before failure.  I was disappointed with the rapid failure of this design."
5.0,Could not find these local.  Fits wallet keeps pics clean.
1.0,Poor design.  The plastic flap that slides into the opposite side of the wallet in order to hold the plastic insert in place is too small and flimsy to keep the insert in my wallet.  Useless.  Now I will have to purchase another from someone else.  Crap.
1.0,The part that inserts into the wallet tore off immediately.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for - fair price - arrived within two days!
1.0,Photo shows Rolf's but that wasn't the brand we got - for the price AND shipping not worth it.  Look elsewhere if you want Rolf's brand.
1.0,Terrible-Fell apart in less than 2 weeks-
1.0,after a short time the insert was in the wallet it began to rip in less than 2 weeks. should not be made of hard plastic.
3.0,"The insert fits properly, however the tab that holds the insert in the wallet is too small and not like the original part.  This tab does not hold up very long.  would recommend you to buy two or three at a time so you can change it as needed if you expect to keep your cards in your wallet safely."
1.0,Did not ship advertised product but did ship a substitute knock off that did not fit.
5.0,Exactly what I needed. Would order again
4.0,Fair
5.0,Happy to find the replacement windows for my wallet.  It gave new life and use to a nice wallet that would have been useless without this item. Thanks Amazon.
5.0,"Just what I wanted. Just like the original inserts which came with the wallet.
These aren't sold in any ""brick and mortar"" stores anymore, so a Godsend."
4.0,Fits into the wallet well and provides plenty of space. The pockets seem to load from left side where as theoriginals seemed to load from the right. Just takes getting used to if you pull the cards out often.
4.0,"They are not exactly the same type that came with my Rolfe billfold. The flap that fits in behind the card holder is smaller, hope it stays in there."
5.0,"I had no problems with this order, and the item quality was as expected. You can put pictures or cards in them with no clarity issues."
5.0,It took me a number of years to get my wallet properly broken-in and these replacements are an excellent fit. Now I don't have to worry about losing pictures!
5.0,Its nice to be able to find the original windows to replace the worn ones.  Nice not to have to purchase a new wallet instead I can use the wallet for a longer period of time!
4.0,"Ok, they weren't as nice as the originals but do the job for the price.  I didn't want to pay a tremendous amount for a piece of plastic.  For the price this is a good buy."
3.0,There is a information problem in general for the size of this insert.  I had to cut it in half to make it work.  Now I have two. The inserts are getting a little beat up already.  The fix would be for me to get the wallet that these inserts were made for.  Otherwise the product was shipped promptly.
5.0,"It is the one that fit my wallet
It is great for small pictures and credit cards.
I would recommend it to anyone in need"
5.0,Fits my wallet perfectly.  Arrived earlier than projected.  Thinking of ordering another just in case this one also wears out.
2.0,The opening for inserting cards has been switched to the opposite side and these are much more difficult to use than my previous ones
5.0,"The perfect inserts for my Rolfs Passport Wallet. You'll need these as the Rolfs wallet will last you a couple of decades, but ""plastic"" seldom does."
1.0,"It appeared that these insert were exactly like the Rolf's inserts.  Unfortunately they are not.  The tab that slides into the slit in the wallet is undersized.  In addition, the opening for each insert is on the opposite side meaning that your card  may easily slide out."
5.0,This is one of my all times favorites and i will gladly recommend it to all my friends. The product is terrific. Shipping was fast.
5.0,"I have had difficulty locating these things. Often the wallet is still healthy, only the insert has been worn out. AND my guy likes the unusual portfolio-style wallet."
5.0,"These things are great, I ended up buying a bunch of them.  There are 6 pages, so that is more than what you get with other brands I think.  The credit cards slide out of the top which makes them very easy to access, but I'm a little concerned they might be easier to fall out of the wallet that way.  So far no problems."
5.0,Great supplement to the Rolfs Men's Cypress Attache Wallet.  Helps me organize my credit cards.  It helps spread out my credit cards in my wallet.
1.0,"This item is falsely advertised as a ""Rolfes"" replacement photos windows.  It is not! It is clearly marked ""Buxton."" The MSRP is clearly marked $1.50 on the sealed packaging. Yet they charged more.  If you're looking for the real McCoy, look elsewhere."
2.0,the sleeve that slips into the wallet to hold windows in is not stiff so keeps slipping out.  would not purchase again.
5.0,Replacement for original. This item is very hard to find for an older no longer made wallet and I was so glad to get a replacement.
2.0,what i ordered was a direct replacement for what came with the wallet  with room for 24 credit cards.  what i received was inserts which only had half that capacity.
1.0,"Several weeks ago I ordered (2) Rolf's replacement ""D"" credit card windows. I was sent a much cheaper version sold by Buxton which was the wrong design, too large to fit my Rolf's wallet and not what I ordered.  When I requested the specific items I ordered, I was informed that MENSWALLET no longer carried the Rolf's version which they advertised on AMAZON and they would take the product off AMAZON.  They refunded my expenses but I really wanted the ""D"" replacement windows.  I can only believe what MENSWALLET communicated  to me:  that they do not carry the authentic Rolf's product."
3.0,"This ""hipster"" wallet insert is cheap and functional.  But it has just four ""pages""  with 2 pockets per page.  The previous insert I wore out had six pages so I had to decide which cards to carry and leave the rest home."
2.0,"Not what I ordered. My order was for Window Replacements by Rolfs D) Credit Card Windows (4 7/8 x 3 3/4 inches), holds 24 photos or credit cards, SIDE loading.  The order I receivd is for 16 windows, TOP loading and is by Buxton. I advised Menswallet of the error and was told they were sending the right order out.  I received the second order which was the same wrong order as the first.  I've asked that if the order can't be filled as requested to credit my account.  I'm waiting for the return label and refund.
So disappointed I didn't get what I had ordered.  If I didn't need 24 windows then the 16 would have been fine, it seems to be good quality."
5.0,These are hard to find.  Could not find any in the stores so I ended up purchasing 4 packs so I can have spares.
1.0,"This item looked like the perfect replacement for my worn out double wide card holder. All reviews were good. Well.....no longer! I have two problems that make this item unusable for me:

1. The height dimension is just a hair bigger than my old insert. This means the new one extends a bit above and/or below the wallet dimension.  And....

2. The reason for this extra height is that the cards insert from the top, rather than from the inside, protected, end of the card sleeves. This means that if you drop the wallet, the upper stack of cards could easily come shooting out. Nothing to stop them.

Not a good design, in my opinion."
5.0,The original wallet insert just plain wore out. My wallet has formed fitted itself to my posterior so I didn't want to go through the agony of breaking in a totally new one. All I needed was some new inserts. These are actually a tad wider than the originals so some items that were a snug fit just slip in easily. I like them.
5.0,"Finally I was able to get the chosen insert. Not too much to say, it does what you expect it to."
4.0,Have used similar products in the past with no problem. Not sure if these were the same manufacturer. Will update if I have any problems.
5.0,"These fit just right, and are very durable. I change them about once a year. Very good quality, and good value."
5.0,"Finally, an easy way to get these wallet windows.  The product was the perfect size and perfectly convenient to buy."
2.0,very flimsy
5.0,This was just what I wanted. I could not locate any store in my area that sold these inserts so I am extremely happy to have them.
4.0,It fits pretty good!!! If you wear anything above a size six I would recommend getting a medium. It's super cute and everything fit pretty well :)
4.0,"The color was perfect, the size just right. I made some minor adjustments of course but it definitely met my expectations and looks great on me.  Only thing I would add if I were the company is a hook-and-eye at the top of the zipper--it held the top so much better.  But that's an easy fix anyway."
5.0,"Wife wanted to use this for costume party.

Quality is surprisingly good.

They didn't design it for a slim figure so the fit is not necessarily best.

Overall a good product.

Thumbs up."
3.0,"DC Comics Deluxe Wonder Women Adult Costume is ""OK"" dress & Cape are nice quality but boot covers ripped while trying on and star logo on headband was already rubbed off upon opening the package. I would not be deterred from ordering this costume because you can replace the accessories with better ones online. My suggestion: Order the Wonder Women wig and platform boots to really make this costume awesome. This costume does run BIG I am between a size 7-8 and a small fit good could probably have ordered an xs. Over all I can't wait to wear the costume on Halloween. IMO the wig is awesome! Very soft and bouncy! If you don't have ""wonder women"" hair naturally get the wig from 7th Ave Store online. The wig comes packaged in a box not a bag! They had fast shipping too."
4.0,"this is really cool outfit, everything is perfect for halloween. I would not recommend wearing it if its really hot out. i wore it for the 4th of july and it is not made for heat."
2.0,"I have never been an X-Small ,but rather a small or medium in costumes, shirts, dresses, etc. This was was too big in the chest (I'm a full D but I have a smaller back so maybe that is why it was so loose). It was also way too long for anyone not 6ft. The boot covers came in 2 different sizes and one was ripped. The only reason I didn't return this item was because I had no time to buy another one. I had to hand stitch the rips and take in the corset part."
3.0,It'll do! You get what you pay for. It served its purpose. Nothing fancy.. just enough to get me through the costume party.
3.0,Too large in the chest area!!!
1.0,Was not too happy with this product. Very cheaply made and way too large. Had to return.
5.0,Great costume just runs a bit larger than expected.
4.0,Great just the top buckled in the middle alil I think because of the material
4.0,Loved the costume.  Added a few of my own touches and received non-stop compliments!! Lose the foam arm bands please!
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Very itchy. Felt like cheap material. Will never wear again.
2.0,"The blue skirt came stuck together and pulled off the color, costume looks terrible now . . . :(  I know you get what you pay for but not damaged from the get go!"
5.0,"I'm 5'2, 115 lbs and I ordered an extra small. The dress was a perfect fit and a great deal. The costume came with all of the accessories pictured."
1.0,This costume is not worth the buy please don't buy it when I got it the costume was mostly foam and fabric
5.0,"Love this costume!  I tweaked it a bit, and made my own boot covers, but it was great! I highly recommend."
4.0,"Dress fit almost perfectly!! Im 59 and 120 lbs and ordered a small. Fit around the waist was spot on, though a little spacious in the chest. Because of my height the skirt was too short but nothing blue shorts or some leggings couldn't fix. Material was of decent quality for a costume that would be occasionally worn.

HOWEVER. i was VERY disappointed when i received my package as the listed tiara, bracelets, belt, and boots were not included. if they had been, i would have rated 5 stars and kept the costume but as it is, i cannot rate what i did not have and will be returning the dress (the only piece i actually got!).

Definitely a good costume, but im left distrustful of ordering another at a later date."
4.0,"My costume was well received. I got a Medium, I'm a size 12 and a DD, I was surprised it was still big. Still loved it though for all the pieces involved.  My kids thought I was the coolest!"
1.0,"I was very disappointed that I was not able to return this.  I left a message for the seller and never received  any feed back for why I could not; I had ordered a few wonderwoman costumes and wanted to see which one I liked and fit.  I didn't like this one nor did it fit, but I didnt' have the option to return it unfortunately."
2.0,Its a cute costume except I should've listened to the reviews before buying... the top part was a bit big and the boot covers kept falling off when I tried it on. I couldn't wear it for Halloween unfortunately. I should've ordered a size smaller :( Maybe I will do that next year.
5.0,"Classic Wonder Woman outfit
Need to have the Wonder top to pull this one off
I am a size 4-6 and needed a bit more Wonder for the top but the rest fit perfectly"
3.0,The elastic on the top part was not tight at all.
4.0,Favorite costume of all time. Can't wait to wear it tonight although I ordered it almost a year ago!
4.0,Other than being too big its a great costume! Well made and looks more expensive than it cost. Will make it work!  Im very short so its probably fine for the average person
4.0,The costume does run a bit big... The bracelets and leggings are quite big. Looks pretty nice all together tho good value.
3.0,The costume runs true to size. However the boot covers don't stay up.
1.0,This costume was very cheap looking and was way too big even after I ordered based on the sizing chart
1.0,"The top half is itchy and is extremely loose and long. The bottom half (the skirt) sticks together, has weird edges, and feels weird."
3.0,"This should have been super cute, but the leg covers were ripped and the color is fading off the skirt already."
3.0,Its a nice costume except its way to baggy around the waist.  It doesnt lay well.  Definitely order a size down.
4.0,Purchased a medium according to my measurements but it is a little big. Other than that is looks great!
5.0,"I love this costume the large fits me well I'm 5'6 240lbs
The only thing you may have to sew in the belt so it doesn't move."
5.0,I'm so pleased with the quality of this costume.  Not cheap and flimsy like most costumes.  Really love it.  Thanks!
4.0,Definitely order one size down. I am usually a L and ordered a M per the reviews. So glad I did because this one is still a bit roomy! With that said it still looks good. It is very flattering and looks great. I am very happy with it!
3.0,"5'4"" About 140 - Way too big in a medium.  Much of it was stuck together and had to be pulled apart. Says polyester but feels like plastic.  Some white paint or something on one side.  If it fit I would have kept it, however, it looked much better on the model."
4.0,The Medium was way too large...the size table and actual measurements were not matching.  The small is a perfect fit.  I'd say they are one size larger than marketed.
4.0,The top was a little bunchy because of the material but overall great for the price.
1.0,We are mailing it back.  It was way too large.  We ordered a different custume
3.0,"Weird material, fits kinda bulky and doesn't do the body good in regards to shaping."
3.0,"Very happy with the quality of the dress and cape but everything else was missing in the package. No headband, boot covers, belt or wrist guards."
2.0,Definitely not made for a 52 person  and the cape is made for a person with a teeny neck... so unless your 55 or taller and thin ...than I don't suggest it
1.0,"This is horrible, do not buy. Horrible material. All wrinkly, skirt was stuck together and when pulled apart the skirt changed color as if was old. Packing looked as if it had been used before. I think this is completely deceiving as to what is displayed and ought to be reported. I am extremely upset that amazon is accepting this item. DO NOT BUY. Just so horriblle"
2.0,Did not like the way this item was constructed. Fabric and construction seem very cheaply puttogether. Ended up having to do something completely different
2.0,"I'm disappointed in the quality because when I was pulling apart the skirt, the print was over lapping and sticking which caused the blue and the stars to come off. Which gives it a tacky appearance. I did order a new one just smaller which is a risk I am taking. I hope the seller can see this and try and be sure that it's not sticky so when I pull it apart it won't rip off the print."
2.0,Im not sure how to say this costume fit. Its a one piece that is stretchy. The top is velvety and doesnt fit well at all for someone with a smaller bust and waist. The skirt part was totally fine and kinda silky. The cape fit too tight around my neck. The belt also didn't look right since the torso of the costume wasn't fitted to me and the belt would sit weird. I didn't try the boot things since the rest was too weird I figured I would leave it wrapped. I think if I had a more shapely body it might look better or if it had a zipper to close like a glove.
5.0,Excellent costume!  The 'bracelets' are a bit too long for my short arms so I folded then in half inside and I added red stars to them to look more authentic. Lots of compliments!
2.0,I didn't expect this costume to be this large. Looked very sloppy so I ordered a medium.
5.0,Love it
4.0,"Cute costume! I wear a medium, but bought a size down thanks to the reviews. Everything fit well, but the top is a little loose and I'm worried I may flash somebody. A couple of stitches or some straps will probably fix it. The boot covers are pretty unwearable, but for under $30, I love the costume!"
3.0,"Great costume, just didn't fit me very well and way too short"
5.0,won first prize at the party
4.0,It is a costume so my expectations are mediocre at best. As far as an inexpensive costume goes it is fine.
2.0,"You have to be at least 5'7"" to wear this and have it fit."
5.0,"Bought this to wear to a superhero themed party. Because of the reviews, I bought a size extra small even though I would normally have ordered a small. I am glad I did. It fit perfectly. So I would suggest ordering a size smaller than normal. I couldn't be happier with this outfit."
3.0,Was missing parts of the outfit
5.0,Order a size down just like the directions or just measure yourself. It should work out just fine. I love this outfit an me and my daughter had a blast and turned a lot of head in our Wonder Woman Costume. I will post photos later. I am so glad I bought this outfit.
5.0,Great piece but did seem to run a little big.
5.0,This costume fit perfectly.
3.0,"The shoe covers fit my legs, but didn't cover my shoes at all. I had to adjust the Velcro on the headband, and sew the sleeves smaller because they were huge. The dress fit great and was really comfy."
3.0,I am a tall size 12. I ordered a large and it was too big. I sent it back and ordered a medium. It is still bulky in the middle. I am ordering a small and seeing if it fits better.
4.0,"It was somewhat large, but I pinned it in the back and the cape covered it so it wasn't too noticeable. The legs fell down so I didn't wear them and the arms looked awkward. but the rest of the outfit was great. I would 4/5 recommend!"
3.0,"The top runs too small and the pants, tiara and belt too small."
3.0,Wasn't what I was hoping for but it did the trick for Halloween. So it gets an Okay for use
3.0,"Over all fit was ok. The bodice part was difficult to keep up. I couldn't use the cape because the wrap around velcro pieces were way to short. The wristlets are silver instead of gold like the rest of the costume.
I was kind of disappointed and had to send it back."
1.0,"I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I was still disappointed.  The tissue paper stuck to portions of the costume basically ruining it.  I wouldn't waste your money on this."
4.0,"This was actually better than expected! I am a size 16 5'5"" and the large fit great except it was a little big in the bust area. The material is thick enough on top that I can wear it without a bra and it still looks fine. The only thing is the boot covers like I read on here they don't stay up and I will probably just not wear them. I think they will get the picture without them. Overall worth the price I think. (Got it for a superhero themed 30th)"
5.0,Awesome fit. Love it 
5.0,Wore this like 3 years in a row! Looks cute!
5.0,Perfect gift. Total surprise. Would buy again.
2.0,Junky
3.0,"I got this for my nephew's superhero birthday party. It arrived promptly, well packaged and all the parts included. I read other reviews that say this runs big, and the chart provided online has measurements included. I typically wear a size 10 or 12, so I ordered the M. It did fit perfectly. More snug then I would want but not indecent. The gold belt included in my package was actually a size Small,  so I had to get creative and pin it to one of my regular belts just to use it with the costume."
1.0,"I hate to leave a negative review (""if you don't have something nice to say..."") but this was such an awful costume I feel an obligation to warn others.  I needed a Wonder Woman costume asap so I paid to get it expedited, which was almost 1/2 the cost of the outfit.  But the dress arrived and was made of such an awful material and so unflattering that I ordered another - paying MORE in shipping than the cost of the new outfit.

The red top was made of some sort strange puffy rubberized felt that buckled and created a lumpy look.  The skirt was a billowing sticky plastic.  The leggings that create the thigh-high boot effect have no way of staying up on your thigh, no elastic or anything, so they just slide down your leg.  And the cape's Velcro around your neck is extremely tight without any room to loosen it.  I ordered a medium and I'm a thin person but it was sewn to fit a kid.

Look, it's alot of work and material for a very low cost and I could understand cheap workarounds to keep the price low but it's super unflattering and unworkable."
1.0,Cheap
4.0,gets the job done
5.0,I bought this for my 13 years old daughter small size I planned a little bit trim but no need.
2.0,Had to return immediately.
2.0,"I returned it. Bottom fit very full and made me look much larger than I am. I liked the corset-like top, but isn't sturdy enough to stand up on it's own. Red velvet had bad creases after a few minutes of wear."
4.0,Very cute costume!  Wayyyyyyyyy too big around the bust and overall really. Def consider going a size or two down.
5.0,"My pup had a matching outfit and we won first place at the local dog bar for our matching costumes!
It's a very cute costume.  The boots didn't stay up on me but I have thinner legs."
3.0,Get your size! It runs true size.
3.0,"I got a lot of compliments while wearing this costume. I do not however like the material. the top is a velvety texture and the bottom is shiny. The cape itches, the arm guards were too big, and the boot covers just did not work. The concept was nice and it would've looked great if everything fit properly. Side note, it doesn't come with a rope. Wonderwoman needs her rope."
5.0,"i took medium, the upper part is a little large"
5.0,Looked and fit amazing!
4.0,"I wore it work (with a black t shirt underneath and black leggings to make it more workplace appropriate).  I""m 5'7"" and the top part was still a bit too long on my torso. But overall a good value."
4.0,Good for the price
2.0,"I thought this would be really cute, had to reorder it down a size. The corset part does not stay flat and keeps bunching up."
3.0,"The material sticks to itself, causing subtle stains."
1.0,Disappointed to find that the order did not contain bracelets and tiara that were listed in product description.  Will be returning.
4.0,"This is a great costume, and it fits taller tweens. Solved the problem for my adorable not-really-niece, who's at the age- too big for children's costumes, too small for most 'grown up; stuff, but this came in sizes and is decent costume quality. (NOTE- for 'no wardrobe malfunction' modesty and warmth in October, my tween gal wore a red turtleneck. this fit well with it.)

Why four stars?  Accurate description but misleading photo advertising. They lose a star because NO- this does not come with the boots or the arm guards, accessories."
4.0,"My daughter is 100 lbs and 5' 1"" . Extra small was perfect but we had to use double sided tape to leggings to keep boot covers up and arm parts were not usable they were way too big."
5.0,"I'm 5'7"" and it was a little tight at first I was 170lb when I wore it. I folded the arm bands in half and bought different shoes and crown. Although if you had taped the shoe covers on they where high enough to cover knee boots. The cape would have keep me warm enough but at the time it was going to be super cold so I made myself a longer one and let my 3yr granddaughter have the one it came with. She loved it too! LOL!"
1.0,Not a good fit
5.0,Super cute!
3.0,The costume was disappointing b/c it was way too big. I am 5'9 and 140 lbs and I ordered a Medium. It was so big it looked ridiculous. I had to return it. I would err on the side of ordering small if you are comfortable with it. The material itself seems like it was good quality though and you get a lot with the costume for your money. I was sorry that it didn't work out like expected.
1.0,"They need to switch to a stretchy material. I don't know what shape they were going for, it fit really awkward. I even tried sewing it and it still didn't fit right. I am an 8 and I got the medium which I guess was too big."
3.0,"I loved the outfit, but top was way too big.  I am going to see if there is a way I can have taken in."
2.0,"The costume was pretty and was comfortable but I had a severe allergic reaction on the back of my legs from the skirt.  I was sitting most of the night.  I am not allergic to any food or medication either.  Not sure what kinds of chemicals are in the dyes or in the material.  I have ordered lots of costumes from Amazon and this is the first time I have ever had a problem.  One other thing, the boot covers/socks are HUGE and I did not use them.  The should offer red knee-high socks instead."
5.0,"Fit a little large, so I ordered a size smaller(medium) and it fit nicely, loose even. Costume looked great and I got plenty of compliments. I'm a 34DD so I was worried about the top part, but it fit perfectly with a strapless self adhesive bra. Great for the price"
4.0,This costume was great with all the parts that came with it! The wrist guards were really big & the bodice of the dress was pretty big as well. It kept bunching up but for what it is & the price I thought it was pretty great! Oh and the boot covers worked well but one was a little bigger then the other.
5.0,"It was two sizes too big, but i rather it be too big than too small. I was able to talyor it to fit."
1.0,When the package arrived I was excited but then when I opened the package and started taking everything out. Noticed that while I was unfolding the skirt the color started trasfering onto the other side and ruined the stars. I was very upset. Needless to say that I returned it.
2.0,"I didn't like the way the costume fit; it was loose in part, and tight in other parts. I couldn't carry it off. It didn't flatter."
1.0,It was to big because stretched a lot and size medium and the material didn't like it I didn't wear it for Halloween felling disappointed
3.0,I doa like the top part of the Dress it didn't fit properly
3.0,Was a perfect costume if I was a size DDD in the chest; everywhere else fit except for the belt was too small. Go figure...
5.0,Great Costume! Fit perfectly.
4.0,"Good costume for the price. I purchased a size small. I'm 5'2"" and weigh 125 lbs. I am larger in the bottom and smaller up on top. The waist and skirt fit fine, but I was not able to fill the top too well. The back of the top has plenty of extra fabric (I didn't need it) but the elastic worked well to hold the top up. I wore a bra with clear straps and the top stayed on just fine. You can see in the picture that the top sagged a bit. That part of the costume (the top) is lined with a thin layer of foam. If purchased in advance, it can be altered to fit better. The boot covers did the job. I held them down over my shoes by using clear bandage tape. The cape is adorable, but I must have a big neck because it was a bit tight. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. I got lots of compliments on the costume."
4.0,"This is a nice set. However like others said it does run big. I wear size XL or 16. This plus size run so big that the top are too big for me. I have to return it for the size issue. Otherwise, it is pretty good set, the dress is longer than it should be but not everyone is model figure to wear mini skirt."
3.0,I had to send it back and get a different size.
5.0,I bought this to wear as a Halloween costume for a party. It fit great but I didn't love the boot covers so I ended up just buying a pair from Goodwill and spray painting them. Other than that it looked amazing
2.0,"The costume is ok at best. The top was fine although shorter than I hoped for (I'm 5'10 with even proportions), but the skirt is awful. The sewing was done haphazardly and there were several places with the skirt bunched up in the seam and the fabric looked terrible. The pleats at the center were completely off center too. I took the skirt off and reattached it so it laid smoothly and was even. The skirt had several places where the blue was coming off because the material is cheap. If it got snagged on something or was pulled at all it would turn white and look awful.
Order down a size or two. If you're on the larger end of what each size will fit, order down 1 size. If you're on the smaller end of each size, go 2 sizes smaller.
I'd prefer straps on it even if they're clear or any way to keep the top up better. Because it fits such a large range there is a TON of elastic on the back and if you're not pulling it tight it doesn't stay up and had an unflattering fit.
The boot covers are poorly made too. I have big calves and they were too big on me. They won't stay up and there's no real way for the cover to stay in place. There's only an elastic that's supposed to go under your shoe but that doesn't work because It attaches with Velcro on the bottom of the shoe so you're stepping on it the whole time. The only way to keep this in place would be to spray glue it to whatever shoes your wearing. You're better off buying the actual boots which look awesome. Too bad I saw them too late to get here in time.
 I wouldn't buy this again unless I was desperate."
2.0,My belt is missing from the costume
5.0,Fantastic costume at a fraction of the cost of Halloween party stores!
5.0,I loved this costume and receive a lot of compliments..it was just a little to big.  Well made/good material!!
4.0,I ordered XS and i am 118lb and 5' tall but it was a little tight on my waist but very happy for a costume quality
2.0,"So disappointed. So many issues. Too small, somewhat melted together upon arrival, and quality is very poor. Many of the reviews on here suggested going a size down because it apparently runs small. This was not the case for me. A size down made it near impossible to get on. And unfortunately there ware no fasteners or zippers in the back, which would have been extremely helpful.

The material on the bust is awful. Super scratchy/itchy material. Very hot and uncomfortable. The skirt bunches at the top, so it's kind of a mushroom shape down there. Not flattering at all. When I opened my package all the material was slightly melted together as well. Pulling the pieces apart from one another resulted in discoloration.

Very unhappy with this purchase. I'm pretty sure it's not returnable now either because I already unpackaged everything in order to try it on."
4.0,"All the reviews about sizing are correct about running large. I wish I had read them more closely before I ordered. It's a great costume for the price, I'm only disappointed I couldn't wear it and had to return since I ordered it just days before I planned to wear it.  I plan to order a smaller size for next year ahead of time (just in case)."
4.0,I read the reviews on this and changed my order from a L to a M if you are a 6 this might be a little big but if you are an 8 its nice and snug.
1.0,"If I could give this item no stars, I would. I took my measurements before ordering this and ordered a large based on what was on their sizing chart. It is MUCH too large - the back is huge and poofy. The skirt is made of some shiny material that sticks to itself and when you manage to peel the skirt apart, the color comes off of it and looks terrible. The tissue paper somehow managed to stick to the tiara and can't be peeled off of the star. The cape stuck to the skirt too and when I peeled the cape off, the color came off the skirt AND the cape.

It's too bad that I ordered this costume so late because it's unwearable which leaves me with nothing for Halloween. I will absolutely be returning this costume immediately."
5.0,This costume fit perfectly!!!  I love the way it looks. I definitely felt like Wonder Woman for the night!
5.0,Great
3.0,"Items is great however it runs a lot larger than expected.  I reviewed numerous over reviews so I ordered a size down than what I typically would and it is still a bit big.  However,  other than being a bit larger it looks good."
1.0,The skirt and cape both were damaged.
4.0,"Reviews said it fit a little large, so I ordered my size hoping it would fit comfortably. Never fails. It fits but definitely snug!"
4.0,"Got mine yesterday. Everything true to size except arm cuffs are huge, but I have small wrists (I purchased a small). The cape connects at the front of the throat, so there's not a perfect ""V"" as shown. The bodice is felt (no biggie). I haven't broken out the boot covers yet. It prob runs a size 4-6 for a small. All in all, it's a pretty great deal."
5.0,"Great costume, great price!  Love it."
4.0,Glad I sized down based on everyone's comments of it running a size big. I'm an 8-10 on top and 10-12 on bottom. Size Medium fit perfect.
1.0,"Completely cheap and awful!! The package was all crumpled up and abused.  The ""tiara"" didn't have a red star on it and the skirt had been folded up so long that when you stretched it out,  the blue peeled off and showed lines."
3.0,The top section would be better if a zipper or elastic for better form fitting
2.0,"I am not expecting a high quality product but when I received this, the product seems
Tonhabe beennoacked before the product had a chance to cool off.  It was all stucked together.  The printed stars on the skirt is not even screen printed right.  It's all stucked together."
3.0,I really loved the costume but it was to big and I went by the size chart
2.0,The skirt honestly looks like a blue star trashbag. Its terrible. The top almost feels like a scratching post. The cape and head piece were the best parts of this costume.
3.0,"I ordered a size down in this costume based on reviews stating that it ran very large. It fit. Although, the top part has an elastic section in the back which makes the material rather bulky looking.  It's not very flattering on my pear-shaped figure. The shiny material that the cape, skirt, and boot covers are made of don't ship well.  They end up sticking together in shipment and as you're pulling it apart, the material gets discolored. Not too bad, but something to consider.  I actually wish I would have ordered a different version of the Wonder Woman costume, but, oh well."
4.0,my daughter loves it
4.0,This runs large bought a small fir my sister who normally runs a med/large. It fits great!
5.0,This costume is very nice and fits well. I had no issues with any of it. I followed the other reviewers comments in regards to the sizing and glad that I did. It came right away as expected next day delivery. Wore it to a Halloween party and surprised how I was the only wonder woman. LOVED IT!!!!
5.0,"All of the pieces are just wonderful. I wear size 12 jeans and generally have wide hips and the skirt fit great, with adequate length. They didn't skimp on material or quality, even for such a great price. Quite modest in terms of Halloween outfits. Lots of options in terms of wearing warm layers underneath or on top too. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"The foam inside the costume, cape and head band was a little itchy and uncomfortable but it was really cute."
4.0,"The red star on the headband was rubbing off. Otherwise, fit/looked as expected."
3.0,Is ok. Fits good but quality is what you pay I guess. I am not crazy about it. If you are looking for a costume that makes you stand up this is not  your best choice.
5.0,Fit as expected !
4.0,"Nice corse!!  Appropiate lenght skirt! The only bad thing is the plastic material stick ! Lose the color when stick it self! I order small , fit perfect"
1.0,"Ill fitting, cheap materials, poorly put together, the Wonder Woman symbol wasn't even sewn onto the costume straight. Wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing, I will be returning the costume."
1.0,"it's made out of cardboard and it's discolored, it's totally overpriced it's disgusting"
1.0,The reviews said it ran large. So I ordered a small instead of my usual medium and I could get barely get it over my head. The skirt was stuck together when I received it and when I pulled it apart the color was removed from some of the fabric. The bodice of the dress is stiff and very itchy.  It is blatantly cheap and the cape  has a very small neck hole. I will be returning this item. I included pictures of the front and back.
2.0,"the shipment arrived and there were no Boot tops, tiara, belt, bracelets included!"
2.0,Ordered this costume and I received it quickly. Unfortunately as I opened it the pieces stuck together and had lots of discoloration. If it had been just a place or two I wouldn't of cared but over half the skirt was discolored. Kind of disappointed.
1.0,"This outfit has potential but it is like it was put in the package while it was still hot and everything sticks together.  When I unstick it... it discolors.  I get that this outfit it not expensive, but you don't expect for the whole thing to be discolored when you take it out of the bag.  Really disappointed."
1.0,"I don't like. it bad made. the skirt was awfull, the color was horrible. Bad quality"
1.0,"Terrible quality and useless.  Skirt material was stuck together. The pattern was ruined when pulled apart.

I do not recommend to anyone!  Don't take a chance."
1.0,"I really didn't like that it was all air sealant. It seemed like it was left in the heat for a while cause it was all stuck together causing it to have discolor ex in certain parts of it.
I really didn't like that the head band is all funky where one side sticks out and the other is sowed on. The star on the head band has paper stuck to it & I can't get the paper off. Overall I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Unless you don't mind all the flaws."
1.0,Very poor quality.  I will return!
1.0,"As everyone has noted, the costume runs on the larger side. I am 5'8'', 150 lbs, usually wear about a size 8. I'm a 34C. The dress is made of foam and polyester, and the skirt was nearly melted together when it arrived. There is no way to iron the dress, as it has to be kept away from heat for fear of melting. The folds where it was stuck together had to be pulled pretty hard to get them to come apart, and the skirt was discolored where it had been stuck together. The bodice is pull on (or pull it all over your head), rouched in the back with elastic around the top, in the back only. The bust is too large for a C cup. It is made of a very thick material, so if you slouch a little, the material bulges out and it looks like I have big rolls. The boot covers do not cover the toe of a shoe and they also do not stay up around the thighs. The gauntlets are huge and not as pictured. The dress and accessories I received are not the same ones in the picture. I got ripped off. I would not purchase this item again."
2.0,I'm a little peeved because parts of the costume stuck together and took the color off when I pulled it apart. The tissue paper also stuck on the tiara star and won't come off
1.0,Worse costume please don't buy.  The material is so horrible.
3.0,"I tried this exact one on at a Halloween shop and realized they ran small. I'm a 12/14 and the medium fits me like a glove! I love this, however it was obvious that this costume sat smushed in a warehouse somewhere and was possibly exposed to heat. The skirt part of the costume got miscolored as a result. Hopefully the wrinkles will come out if I hang it. But for a $30 costume, I didn't have high expectations."
1.0,"This costume is trash. I ordered it twice thinking the first time may have been a fluke. The skirt material comes all stuck together, almost like it's melted. When you pull it apart the color is ruined where it was stuck together. Spend the extra money and get a good quality costume."
3.0,"This costume is cute, but the one I received was not only small, but it was also all stuck together in the package.  When I pulled it apart the color where the skirt had stuck together was damaged.  Returned."
5.0,Very efficient with the return of my money into my bank account. I ended up not wanting to do this costume.  I got the medium due to the reviews but it fit small (as expected I'm 5.7 186lbs) but did feel like if I got a large it would be to big. For the way it fit when i had the medium on.
4.0,i need to send back and get larger size.
4.0,The velvet on the costume keeps you warm
5.0,Ibougth extra small so I think it was my fault! It is excelent
4.0,I am smaller in the bust but needed a medium for the belt to fit. Overall very cute in person.
4.0,Great costume. It's not too short and I'm 5'9 so it works for me perfectly. I didn't like the silver hand pieces & the legging boot covers but everything else about it is good 
2.0,"The costume is NOT the same as the picture.
The costume sits high in the waist, not the hips. Also the skirt looks puffed out and does not look at all as the picture. The belt looks cheap compared to the picture and she is not wearing the boot covers. The picture is misleading. Very disappointed.
The accessories and quality is adequate for what I paid. I purchased nicer cuffs and the boots in my picture I also purchased. The dress fits nothing like the picture and does not look nice."
5.0,It's a nice costume just doesn't fit snug enough like the women in the photo. Maybe I should have gotten a large not extra large. I'm 5'5 180 but I'm solid not flabby so I don't know it's loose in the back and on the sides
3.0,The top was too large and the skirt was very unflattering. I returned it.
5.0,"Exactly as sizing chart specify , is a tad itchy"
1.0,"Really bad dress loose size small Im 120 pounds is to big.
Dress damage and head band too."
3.0,THE RED BLED ONTO THE WHITE ON THE BOOT COVERS
4.0,"Since other reviewers said this runs large, I ordered a medium and it was about right.  I would consider myself to be a long-torso person, and the top of this is still a bit too long for me.  I wish there was a good way to make it a bit shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create the illusion of tummy rolls, which I have recently worked pretty hard to eliminate!  Overall, I have made the fit quite good, but I did remove a piece of elastic from the inside of the back of the skirt that was about 6 "" long so it pulled the skirt to the point of being so tight it hurt.  Removal of that piece and the skirt hangs very nicely and the torso fit pretty well.  The top part is definitely designed for a well-endowed person, so I had to take in a few inches there as well.  The belt was a bit tight, so I moved the Velcro over to make it fit.  The cape Velcro was positioned weird so that it scratched my neck when attached, so I moved  one piece 90 degrees to the other so that the neck attachment actually forms a ""V"" point, which I believe is how it is supposed to look.  I am currently shopping for some boots to wear because the boot covers are a bit of a joke compared to the rest of the costume, which is pretty decent quality.  Overall I do like the costume, but I would say that chances are quite slim it will fit anyone perfectly right out of the package.
My top is the fuzzy covered foam material, and the skirt is a shiny polyester.  I did buy some biking-type shorts to wear underneath for comfort, with the blue and white star pattern than matches almost perfectly.  The skirt is a good length, but still a bit short for a 50 year old woman going out in public."
5.0,Good value!
5.0,Fast delivery. Item as described. I'm very satisfied.
2.0,"The costume is fine but it would be nice if it would've come with everyone it said it was supposed to. I'm missing the headband, bracelets and boot covers and can't find a way to contact the seller. Awesome."
5.0,great
5.0,This is a great Wonder Woman costume!  I'm so glad I read the other reviews before ordering.  I normally wear a size 18 or a size 18W and took the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a size down and purchased the size Large.  I also purchased a pair of blue and white star shorts to wear underneath since I felt the skirt was too short.  The top and belt fit perfectly too.  I will try and post pictures later this month when I wear it to a Super Hero themed birthday party.
5.0,"Better than expected! Top is soft material, not the cheap plastic of most costumes. I ordered small because I can wear 4-6 in dresses and it fits perfectly."
3.0,"Based on reviews I thought I'd better order an XS. But the problem I ran into is that while the bust area fit, the waist is a little snug. So while I don't think the Small would have fit at the bust portion, I have to rate this less. Also, the top does slide down because the ribbing does not hold it up long term. And the wrist ""gloves"" do not fit correctly around your arm. I will wear this but am going to upgrade the accessories to make the outfit look better."
5.0,"Awesome.. Can't wait for Halloween. Medium fits well.  I am 5'8"" & weight 160.. It fits great!"
2.0,Need to return. The top does not fit will. It does not lay flat on the sides. Need to return this.
4.0,"This was by far the greatest costume at this price I could find. I loved this. I actually taught a fitness class in this. While it was hot because of the material, it fit as expected. The only thing I would change is the quality of the boot covers."
5.0,"I normally wear a medium and I bought a small and it fit well. Bought a lasso and didn't use the boot covers as they were an odd fit. I also didn't use the ""cuffs"""
3.0,I am a size 12. The body of the costume was super stretchy and loose it was comfy but it didn't look as cute as I wanted it too.
1.0,My child laughed at me when I put this atrocity on last Halloween. It's that bad.
4.0,I love this costume! I bought it for a charity run and had a blast! Since I was running I used everything except for the boot covers.
1.0,"I would normally get a medium but after reading the reviews went for the small as suggested. The item fit if you could call it that. The bust/waist fit fine but it had these weird horrible bulges that came out of the sides in the under arms. Looked like a blind guy sewed it. Do not recommend. Cute design, but very poorly executed"
5.0,Cute outfit
1.0,Fit too small and I thought it looked cheap for what I paid for it. Returned to seller.
5.0,OK
2.0,"The cape is so tight around the neck it feels like it's meant for a child, and the bust part of the outfit is huge"
4.0,"Love it! Skirt is a bit long (I'm about 5'3"" 155 lbs.), so I will be hemming it.  I got a size medium but measured a size large.  One flaw is the boot covers do not stay up at all!  I had to put rubber bands on each boot at the top by my knees, to hold the boot covers up.  Then the toe part keeps sliding off my shoes.  So I bought the actual wonder woman boots to wear instead. (not pictured) Other than the boot covers being horrible, the costume is very comfortable and cute!  I can't wait till Halloween to wear it!  The picture is with everything that comes with the costume, the boot covers look cute but do not stay up, it wasn't too bad with the rubber bands at the top but then the foot part would slide off as I walked around.  This would be very annoying all night at a party."
3.0,"To consider the number of stars I would give this, I had to take into consideration the various components of this costume.  I am 5'6"" and 135 pounds and ordered the small costume, and it fits nicely.  Here is my review:

The bodice/skirt: the main piece of the costume consists of the bodice (top) and skirt, which are connected.  Overall, this part of the costume is pretty decently constructed, and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The bodice is a velvety material and has some stretch and structure to it, but I noticed other reviews mention a zipper.  Mine did not have a zipper, so I had to pull it over my head and hope not to stretch it too much.  It fits pretty snugly, but does not provide chest support, so it would most likely have to be worn with a strapless bra or bustier for a little more structure.  I am a 34D and the small provided enough coverage.  The skirt is cute, a shiny blue material with gold stars, not much else to say about that.

The knee-high boot covers: terrible and unusable!  The tops are not tight enough and sag, and the bottoms hang loosely and won't completely cover boots.  I won't wear them with this costume, and I might try to find an alternative.

The belt: fits nicely around my waist/hips, although just barely.  I could see if someone was more curvy, the belt might not fit. The belt would be better with a little stretch to it or some elastic in the back.

Arm cuffs: while the rest of the costume has gold accessories, the cuffs are silver.  They are very basic and loose on my forearms.  I will wear them, just so I have something on my wrists, but I might spray paint them gold.

Head piece: will work just fine!  It is as pictured and wraps around the head and fastens with Velcro.

Cape: lightweight and fastens around the neck.  The Velcro fasteners are a little scratchy on my neck, but it's a costume, so I expect a little Velcro here and there.  Thankfully, the cape helps to hide some of the imperfections of the bodice.

I should mention that I had to exchange my costume for another in the same size because the bodice of the costume had some weird bulging on the sides that made it look like I have rolls under my arms and on my sides.  I haven't received the replacement, so I hope it will be sewn a little more carefully."
5.0,great looking costume for the money.  its not too short so i can wear it to work without flashing my goodies.  the top is loose so I had it taken in(size 12 top/large/ 36DD) but the hips fit my size 14 curves so I got the large.
5.0,Happy with it
5.0,Packaged Nicely. It was a bit wrinkly. And had to tape the boot sleeves to soles of shoes because it rode up exposing shoe underneath. It was very skimpy but appropriate for a wonder woman costume. The head peice and arm ands were cheapy but still worked for the price. I was happy with the purchase.
3.0,The Wonder women custom was great. Well made and the fabric was nice. The size was a little to big for me even thought I follow the size chart provided by the seller. The only thing that wasn't nice was amazon return policy. The seller say that they accept return all you have to do is print the return paper from amazon. I try but wasn't very successful. But the wonder women custom was great and the price was great.
4.0,"After reading reviews, I ordered a small. I'm 5'5, 137 lbs, & a 36D. I'm a size 6 but hour glass shaped. The dress fits good. You will definitely need a push up bra or something because it's not real piping and is a velour cover more than a bodice. The skirt is short as expected and I will be wearing some type of boy short or something underneath. The belt does not fit at all! It fits my head and is essentially the same length as the head band! The silver arm bands are fairly cheesy. Almost look like they belong to an astronaut costume. I think I may try to make my own if I have time. The boot covers aren't great. They are really long but could be tucked in. The material is transparent but on top of boots, that wouldn't matter. I don't think they will stay on though as there is no elastic in the toe to keep them in place. There is a strap that goes underneath, but it was still loose for me. I think I'll end up spray painting a pair of boots I use for costumes anyway. The cape is made of polyurethane foam, it seems like it all is, but will work fine. I ordered this for my sons 6th birthday as he wanted a Halloween birthday party. All in all I think it's cute & will work for what I need with some minor modifications."
5.0,"After a different size it really worked out.
Thank you Amazon"
5.0,Sexy
4.0,I got a small because I saw in some reviews that it was too big...well it fits but it's hard to put on and i was scared to rip it...i think if I gain a pound I won't be able to fit in anymore. It's better to get a size so it's  lose...worse case scenario is better to sew than to add fabric
4.0,"Ordered this for an event at work. I wore a nude colored shirt under it to keep it appropriate. I received a lot of compliments on the costume as a whole, but wrist bandscwere a lityle small and I gave narrow wists. Other than that I revommend this costume!"
4.0,"It fit as expected, but the elastic in the waistband was the reason I say ""somewhat small."" The elastic is uncomfortably tight on my waist and the rest of the costume fits great."
2.0,This product came and according to customer descriptions was not at all what I was expecting. It has a velvet top part and cheap shiny skirt attached. The bands are thick and bulky not tight and sleek like in pictures on page. The top is not even in the back and bunches up. I ordered this for a Relay for Life event themed Superheroes so since the event is next week I don't have time to return this and find a better costume.
2.0,Awful costume fit...
4.0,"I wear a medium. According to the reviews, it runs big...so I ordered a small. Well, it fit as expected, meaning I should have ordered a medium since that is what the size chart says. The small was way too small. The costume is really cute though, so I'm just going to return it for a medium."
4.0,The costume was pretty good quality. The top part is velvety and the skirt is a flowy shimmer skirt. It was great for the price.
4.0,"Cute! Fit well. The boot covers are a little awkward, and the cape was a little tight around the neck, but other than that I really liked it."
1.0,Strange foamy fabric doesn't stretch.
1.0,"As per the reviews, the fit is really big, but oddly proportioned. I'm 6 feet tall and typically wear a size 12. The measurements for the large size costume seemed accurate, but the fit is way off. The corset/bodice is huge and better for someone with a DD chest. There is elastic around the back of the bodice, but the entire back panel sags, making the skirt fall uneven. The neck opening of the cape is very small too, and the velcro fastener closes too snugly. There are large tags and strings everywhere that need to be snipped. The arm cuffs are also super wide. I'm going to try and have a seamstress sew up the sides a little and try to make it fit instead of attempting to return this. I'm really disappointed with the quality, workmanship and value for the price. It's not worth it. Take your chances, buy some fabric from a craft store and try sewing your own outfit - you would probably have more success."
4.0,"The top fit very oddly (lots of extra fabric in rear) and was a little itchy.  The arm bands were ridiculous and would only fit someone with wrists like the Hulk.  Otherwise, for it's purposes as a one time only costume, it was fine and fit my family theme."
5.0,"Cute , quality outfit. Completely worth the little extra money and leaps and bounds better than the brick and mortar places you drive to. The legging things that make up the boots was the only thing that ran a little big, but a few quick whip stitches and it was perfect."
4.0,"I got a size bigger because I read the reviews, I could have went a size smaller but it worked"
4.0,Great costume for under $40! The sizing is off is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.
4.0,Great for the price and it was flattering! Comfortable to wear.. it's not the best quality but it's good for the a costume
5.0,Work Well for my wife for Halloween
1.0,"Cheap, no structural support, and looked awful on.  I'm pretty sure Linda Carter's costume was form-fitting."
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size smaller than I usually wear. But I wish I just went with what I normally buy. Now I have to exchange it. I weigh about 119 on a skinny day :) am 5'7"" and wear a 34DD and Not gonna lie, I was more than a little mashed. The costume itself is the thick foam/velveteen stuff so it will have creases and lines in it that even steaming may not get out. The skirt is the ""super"" (ha) thin metallic stretchy material, but swishy and cute. If they really wanted to do this costume ""justice"" (<------ punny ;) then they would add a zipper and boning. Maybe then, life would be magical, and I would walk around in this outfit fighting  crime daily."
5.0,"I did have to pin the back together because it was too big, but it looked so great for a cheap costume that I didn't even care. So fun."
5.0,Thanks
5.0,Best costume ever! Follow the directions and go down a size.
2.0,Last minute thing so I purchased. Fits bigger than expected. Material will make you sweat so much and its just foam.
4.0,Looks good
3.0,It's very big.  If I would have worn it it would have fallen off and bared my chest.
4.0,I liked it but returned it because I ordered a different costume. Never wore this one.
3.0,This item was way bigger than expected and the boots didn't stay up. They kept fall off. If items were a little smaller they would of been better.
2.0,"You really do get what you pay for. This garment is awful. I get that it's a costume, but wow. The top is velvet with like a foam backing, so it adds thickness to your sides and waist. Last time I checked, women don't want to appear THICKER than they are. Plus, the back has an elastic across the top and then it's loose in the waist. The fit is horrific. I'm a large in women's clothing so I ordered a Medium since I read they run large. It was still huge on me. I ended up having to cut it up and modify it so I could use the skirt. I bought a corset from Hot Topic and just wore that.
The cape was so tight around the neck I was choking. The arm bands are huge and silver and look so chintzy I didn't put them on.
I would suggest skipping this item altogether."
3.0,"Item was made well, but with stretch fabric and elastic back , not zippered like the description, it just did not fit well. It runs Very big. I am typically a XL and due to the previous reviews I ordered a L and it was still way to big."
1.0,Only received the dress and cape not the accessories. Not happy with purchase.
5.0,Love it!
1.0,"The costume looks good but is missing several items, that where supposed to be included; boot tops, tiara, bracelets and belt."
4.0,"Very realistic looking, but it does run a little large. 4 stars because the belt was too small."
4.0,"Overall happy with the costume. Didn't use the boot covers, they're always cheaper looking than in the pictures. It bunched a little in the torso."
5.0,some back-ironing will do the costume lots of good.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,awesome
2.0,Small and cheap - but guess that's what halloween's about.
5.0,stretched out to fit and worked well not to short I am 5'1 95 pd's great wrapping and packaging all tags were intact and worth the sale price I paid!
5.0,"Costume was great!  For true to Suze abs the accessories were all practical and well made. Also,  a great deal.  Costume stores selling the same costume for $60."
3.0,"It looked okay on. The material was a velvet like for the top part while the rest was a heavy shiny material. Not at all polyester like stated in the description. Although I did not like the costume the material was not cheap and it fit well. It came with all the accesories in perfect condition, so only complaint is the way it looked, not as expected."
5.0,It was actually for my grandson's girl friend and he said it was fine.
5.0,"I LOVED THIS CUSTOM It came with everything but the lasso, but that did not matter because I was totally Wonder Woman....LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!"
3.0,"cute and no too short which is hard to find these days. The waist part was not flattering. it bunches up alot, i wore a corset under it and clipped it in back to help it keep its shape. boot covers were great they fit perfectly over my boots people thought they were actual boots:)"
4.0,The outfit quality is nice.  We ordered a Large and will be returning for a medium.  My wife is 5'1'' and wears a 34DDD top.  The Large was too baggy around the waist and top.  I will update after we receive the Medium.
1.0,ill fitting - I ordered large but it was more like an Xlarge but still not fitting good. I bought it because it was so discounted and thought I could fix it - but not sure.
5.0,loved it!
4.0,The outfit ia cute but the cuffs and bulky and weird. I actually ordered this for the cuffs and headband but am going to use the suit amd cuffs only. The boot covers are way to big. The cuffs are ok after I safety pin them smaller. The headband is cheaper than the cheap one I have. The cape and dress are nice but I am going to have to pin the waist smaller too. Overall nice and would recommend it.
4.0,Nice costume for the price.
1.0,"It was cheap fabric, very thin material and didn't look anything like the picture. Came too small, and returning it is a nightmare."
4.0,"The fit was okay. I'm a size 14 dress/pants. However as the day progressed, the dress stretched out,  i kept having to pull it up at my chest. The belt and cape fit really tight. The ""boots"" wouldn't stay up so i had to use velcro. Everyone liked the costume though."
5.0,It arrived late and missing ALL accessories:(
4.0,"The costume I received was not the one on the picture, that being said i didn't dislike what I got. The costume is cute and very good for the price. It doesn't include the boot covers, so bought the separately."
4.0,Great for Halloween.
4.0,"Great costume for Halloween. Only downside is the fake boots. Because the costume size runs large, I got a medium, which fit fine. However the shoe length was too short (probably about shoes size 7, whereas I wear size 10). They kept popping up over my shoes. Also it's a one wear deal - the costume cannot be washed or dry cleaned!"
4.0,"Fit perfect, would've gave 5 stars but the cape was to tight for my neck."
1.0,fit as expected but most of the costume was missing
2.0,The fit was too large
4.0,Great
2.0,"I wear a size 10 and although the outfit size medium fit, the accessories (cape) and wrist bands were on the small side.  Also the foam bustier wrinkled and just looked cheap.  The belt was defective as the gold color was faded in the front and it is brand new.  Will return for something else."
5.0,Great value for the price
4.0,"I like the costume, it fits perfectly. However, the belt, and arm armor looks really cheap so I decided not to use it. Overall, it is a really great product for a really great price."
5.0,"Actually a pretty decent costume for the price (only $13 when I purchased). After reading the reviews I went a size down from what I would normally wear. The boot covers aren't the best but what can you expect! The skirt was a good length for me. Not long but not too short, as long as I didn't bend over! Would definitely recommend for the price!"
3.0,Fits larger then expected.
5.0,Bought it for my daughter and she looked fantastic!
5.0,Couldn't beat it for less than $20.
3.0,"Came with some small holes in the skirt, but for a last minute halloween purchase & the price I paid, can't beat it."
4.0,"For the cost, it was what I expected. The quality was quite good I was very impressed. I ordered the Extra - Small because that is my size & it was a little snug, I had to stretch it out a little. The ""cuffs"" were a bit too big for me & so were the boot covers. Other than that it was a great costume for the price. Perfect for a last minute costume party."
5.0,High quality costume that exceeded expectations. My daughter is 5'4 and 90 lbs and the xs fit great! The fabrics are sturdy and the velvety top is great!
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" and typically wear a size 4 (sometimes 6) and bought a size Small. It fit around the hips (though the skirt was goofy puffy)...the top part seemed snug but it's not like wearing a corset..it would often crease up on the sides which I found kind of annoying because it just wasn't flattering around the mid section.  Also, I definitely did not have enough cleavage to fill in the bust area!  Although I did not find the costume very flattering on my body type (it would probably look much better on someone with more of an hour-glass figure), I still got a lot of compliments on Halloween. Like the other reviews, the cape was choking me so I couldn't wear it the entire night.  The material is pretty good...I think the costume will hold up for a few more wears.  Not bad for what I paid for it."
3.0,"Loved the costume but it was a little too big. I normally wear a large (12/14) in tops so I thought it would fit. I still got lots of compliments on it, i just would have liked it to be more form fitting. :)"
4.0,"I'm 5'6"", so the boots were too long. The belt runs small. The rest of the outfit was fine!"
3.0,"It was pretty cute, and fit well but wished the arm bands were gold to match the headband. It would have been great if it came with shoe covers to make boots.  Also the winged-W sticker started to peel off at one edge during the first time I wore it at the Halloween party :("
5.0,Awesome costume. Delivered exactly as advertised. Defiantly a good buy.
4.0,"As other reviewers have said, the skirt is really big and poofy. I didn't mind because I wore this to waitress on Halloween and it kept the creepers at bay since it is not too revealing. I got a size medium, I am usually a large. I have DD cup size and I still had some room in the top so I would keep that in mind. All in all, a good and comfortable costume."
1.0,"TERRIBLE quality. Couldn't even wear it. The top portion of the dress is this velvety felt-like material that seems fine until it's on your body. The second you bend over or sit down, the material instantly and permanently creases where it was folded, making the bodice look chunky and bizarre. The bodice also accentuates any extra ""cushion"" you might have on your midsection.... Really truly horrible. Unless you have a super toned abdomen with no excess chunk, and unless you're POSITIVE you won't sit down or bend down even ONCE all night, then you might be okay with this costume. Get a size smaller though, because they run big. Otherwise, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Don't bother."
3.0,good quality but way to  big everything big.
3.0,"The costume authenticity is great. It is really cool but it runs large. I personally wear a 12 pants and a Large shirt and the top of the ""Large"" costume was bulky and wrinkled up, making it look like I had a huge fat roll around my waist. It made me look a lot bigger than I really am.  I should've went with the medium."
2.0,"overall each piece is just big
One of the hardest parts of the costume to get right is the ""boots"" it's as if you have to glue that down in order for It to look neat"
3.0,Runs big
3.0,"Overall a nice costume for the price however I feel as if it runs a bit large. I'm petite 5""3 ish  and I felt as if this was a bit too full and the top was a bit loose I ordered the small should've maybe confident extra small but I didn't wanted to be too short etc.  but again between the pricing and the little accessories you get with it it was worth it !"
3.0,"It was a little large and my shoes where two different ones, one was shiny and the other wasn't"
4.0,I'm smaller on top and curvier on bottom. 160lbs and 5'9. After reading all of the reviews I was nervous to go a size small because I though it would be too short.  I just needed a quick cute costume. I should have gotten the small instead of the medium. The top was loose and would bunch up in weird places. Fixed this with a few safety pins. Got soooo many compliments on this outfit. Shipped in 2 days w/ Amazon prime.
4.0,"I thought I was going to hate it, until I put everything together! The dress is beautiful!! The top part is like a foam/velvet fabric, and the bottom is a shiny stretchy almost plastic fabric.. But it's pretty! Promise! Although the ""boot covers"" we're just a disappointment! Too lose and didn't even cover my entire foot! I'm a size 9.. And I have thick legs, and they were still too lose! But an adjustment can fix everything! I just bought long socks and put white duck tape over them! But everything else was amazing!!! Turned out fine! Although I do recommend you buy a size smaller! I'm 5'7 and I had to put a petticoat underneath to puff it up because it was too long for my taste.. The skirt reached to about mid-thigh..  And it was lose from my chest as well. I'm smaller on top, and bigger in the bottom half, so a XS would probably been better for me for a tight fit.. So get a size smaller!! Loved this costume! Got many compliments! I also got the wig to make it all come alive! Beautiful costume!"
1.0,"Reviews said it ran large, the XS was tiny"
2.0,"This costume is extremely ill fitting. I normally wear a large in most clothes, especially due to a large bust, but even this costume was WAY too big on my chest. The skirt was too long and covered the boot covers, which didn't stay up and were too small to cover even a loafer shoe I had on when I tried them. No way they were going to cover up any boots! The gauntlet bracelets were HUGE and made for a bodybuilder's arms, not a regular girl. This is on its way back to Amazon already. Very disappointed!"
5.0,I am a size 10-12 and based on reviews I bought a medium. It fit well. Cute. The cape makes the outfit.
5.0,"The one I bought straight from Amazon came by really fast, within the span of 10 days and that's fast coming from Canada! The costume was exactly what I wanted and shown exactly what was depicted in the picture, not too showy in the chest area and school appropriate enough for my last year in high school! I did have to adjust the torso on the back a bit as it was a bit too loose and ended up creasing on the sides. Not too much of a probably though, didn't really end up using the boot tops too much as they wouldn't stay with my boots. Pretty happy with my purchase and can be re-used for next year's Halloween! :)"
5.0,"The costume is great, very well made.  The bust and arm cuffs are very large though."
5.0,"I've lost a lot of weight so I'm hesitant to say it runs large but I believe an xl should have fit me right but it is definitely too big and I wish I had a large. Too late to send it back, nothing a little pining won't fix. Otherwise I love it and all these pieces for the price can't be beat!"
5.0,"I had ordered for the first time from this company about two weeks ago. The first costume I ordered was a large (costumes usually run small) I received my order literally in two days! But it was too big. So I sent it back ordered a medium and received that on immediately as well. No problem! Customer service was excellent. Although the medium was still a little big as well, they did disclose in the description that this particular brand runs a bit larger than usual. Very satisfied with company and service! Thanks again!"
3.0,Ok for the price. Not sure how comfortable I will be in it. Seems to fit OK but not the most flattering design. I should probably have gone with the plus size design.
5.0,Great product
4.0,Perfect for Halloween ;-)
5.0,Costume looks great!
2.0,Just didn't fit as I expected!!
2.0,"I got the costume a week ago and had to take in an inch  so that it would fit and stay up.  I ended up putting straps on it so it would not bunch around the waist because it has nothing to keep it's form.  The fabric is thin so adjustments were difficult without running the costume.  Would buy 1-2 sizes smaller.  I am 5'7"" 150 and ordered a medium."
1.0,sending it back sorry
1.0,"cheaply made, crushed velvet with foam underneath. Bunches up. Skirt is vinyl. Had to return it."
2.0,Costume is as described but boot covers do not stay up at all and I was constantly having to adjust!!
1.0,"This costume was very cheap, and looked horrible on. Not like the picture at all, totally unsatistified with it."
2.0,Too small.  The arm bands are huge.
1.0,AWFUL.  LOL Oh man. Just awful.  Okay so the large is meant for someone 200lbs 5 feet tall (top) but the skirt was way too long.  So weird.  It was like a foam top that didn't stay up.  The skirt was 2 sizes too big compared to the top.  I tried to see it to fix it.  Ugh. Needless to say I threw it away.  Total waste of money.
3.0,It was little to small for me .
4.0,"My girl normally wears small, we ordered extra small and it fit correct so these things run a little big on sizing"
5.0,"For the price, this is a very cute costume!"
4.0,Huuuuuge!!!!
5.0,Love it! Fits well and good quality for a costume.
3.0,I ordered this bases off the reviews. They were helpful but I should have never ordered this item. This is great if short skirts are what you like. I'm a pear shape and this doesn't help out either. I'm much smaller on top. I'm a med on the bottom and a small up top. So over all the skirt was to short for my taste and I just didn't have enough upstairs to hold the darn thing up.
3.0,Good price but runs much bigger!
4.0,"Almost every review I read said the costume ran large.  I'm 5'5"" and 115lbs.  I get a small in everything so I ordered an extra small.  The dress was way too tiny and the arm bands were huge.  I re ordered a small."
2.0,Too big and now i have nothing to wear...ugh
3.0,It's sorta of big around the bust
3.0,"The dress fit as I expected it would, but the cape is small and too tight around my neck.  The boots are actually leggings, and they are way too big.  I ordered a pair of red rain boots and a larger red cape to compete the costume.  Based on past experiences with packaged costumes, I was prepared to make some changes and additions to the accessories.  I am pleased with the way the main part of the costume fits and looks."
1.0,Horrible. There was nothing about it I liked. It looked like something a hooker would were. Cheap materiel and extremely difficult to try and return.
5.0,"The previous reviews I read were spot on. This costume is larger than size indicated. I would normally get a medium but this Small fits perfectly.
Love it and thanks for the speedy delivery."
3.0,"This is a nice costume, however, the belt they send you is not in the v shape that follows the shape of the skirt. I ordered in two sizes because I was unsure of which would fit and they both had the same shape. Other than that, it is nice. Wish the arm bands where gold instead of silver and that it followed the actual Wonder Woman outfit."
3.0,Top bunches up and the belt is so wrinkled and twisted that it won't lay flat.
5.0,Looks just like the picture!
5.0,"I was skeptical about purchasing this costume after reading some of the reviews, as it was about 50/50 good and bad. But I ordered it anyway and the costume is actually perfect. It looks exactly like the picture shown. The boot covers are velvet red with white stripes. The skirt portion of the dress is a shiny blue material and the top is also a velvety red corset with a stretchy back. I am 5/9 and weigh about 125 lbs and and a C-cup and the small fit me perfectly. I normally wear a size medium in tops but after reading that this costume runs small I went for a small instead of medium and the fit was great. The skirt portion was also a good length, short enough to be sexy but not too long. Would recommend, especially for the price and all the accessories you get with it (headband, cape, boot covers, and arm bands)."
1.0,Not the same as the picture. Red soaks without white lines. I didn't like it.
5.0,"I bought a size small and it fit perfectly. I am 5'5, 150lbs.
Great quality and not too short."
1.0,"Positives:
- All of the posts about ordering a smaller size were accurate! I'm 5'4, 145lbs (bigger in the lower half of my body) and the costume does fit well.
- Costume was delivered much faster than the estimated delivery date
Negatives:
- There's a hole in the top
- 'Boot covers' are actually just red knee high socks.
- Material is stretchy spandex and not velvety with bones like what's been described in other people's posts. You can see every bump...
- Quite short (although sort of to be expected for halloween costume)"
4.0,"I ordered a small, which is what I normally wear (size 4), even though the other reviews said to order a size smaller because this costume runs big. I figured that it would be better to have it big and be able to have a tailor take it in. I am glad that I ordered a small! It was a bit snug, but it did fit. I am 5'9"" and weigh 143, I have a 34"" in seam and am average bust size. The dress is a velvet type material (no wire in the bodice area though) and the skirt portion is a satiny type material. The skirt was a good length (still sexy), even though most of the time being so tall skirts are too short. The head band was a bit big and the silver arm cuffs didn't fit quite right. The boot covers were fine, where as the reviews I read said that they were really loose. Order this according to your actual size! I would say that this costume would fit a girl perfectly that is very busty, very small waisted and not too tall ( maybe 36- 24-34 measurements). On the positive side, it arrived really quick (within 2 weeks)! For the price, $35, I'd say it's worth it."
2.0,The accessories are great!! The fabric of the dress reminds me of children's polyester pajamas that can never come out of the dryer good. It is super cheap. I will keep the accessories and make my own skirt and top.
4.0,"It's fits well.
Just got really wrinkled and not sure how to get it out because of the type of fabric."
1.0,"Description says ""This set includes a red cape, boot tops, bracelets and tiara"" but none of that, except the cape, came with the dress."
4.0,Somewhat small
1.0,"The costume I received was similar in look to the one pictured here on the site, but when it arrived I realized two things:
1. It was NOT the same costume, the materials are not the same, the quality was poor. I went to a costume store and found the exact one pictured here, the materials were completely different from the one I received in the mail.
2. The sizing was WAY off. I am a 10/12, and according to this sizing chart, the large should have fit without issue. This costume was so small, I thought they had actually sent me the wrong size. But, the tag reads ""L"".  I could not even attempt to put it on, it was literally that tiny. However, the one at the store fit just fine in a large. SO, I am returning this item."
4.0,All reviews said it was running big so instead of ordering a plus size I ordered a Large.  Very Pleased with the Costume and it fit like a glove ;)
4.0,It's great! I can't wait to wear it for Halloween
5.0,Absolutely love this costume!!!!! It was perfect for my nephews birthday party. Full coverage and comfortable for a couple of hours.
5.0,This was exactly what I expected. A few reviews said it ran small so I ordered down a size and it fits perfectly. It arrived with all of the accessories and would definitely recommend it to a friend.
1.0,Awful costume. Very cheaply made. I ended up returning it. One piece dress with no zipper or back hook closure.
3.0,"Product runs BIG! I wear a 6, so I ordered the medium...this outfit Hung off of me. It's cute and cheap, would do the trick. Just order a size smaller."
1.0,This costume was very short and too large in the torso. It made my waist look huge because it wasn't fitted. I would not go a size down because it would be obscenely short.
5.0,Somewhat large because it fits 10-14 and I'm on the smaller end but the  boot covers fit well.
4.0,It works as desired. Not great but certainly not bad
1.0,This is way too large!  It looks great in the picture & has great color in the costume but definitely did not like it on me.
4.0,Very good quality.
5.0,Used for a costume party. Worked well
1.0,Not as described. Disappointed
5.0,Gorgeous costume but was way too big for me..if you wear extra large..order a large
4.0,"Super cute! The foam on the cape and wristlets is a little itchy/irritating. Sizing is generous for a costume, with lots of give in it."
1.0,Garbage
5.0,"The costume was great.  I wore it for an event kicking off a local library ""super hero"" reading program for kids.  The library couldn't find a Wonder Woman costume for me so I bought this one myself, and I fit in fine with the rented costumes other people wore.  It was nice because it was modest for the kids at the bust and skirt (the woman's chest in this picture isn't how you'll look unless you're using some major duct tape).  I ordered smaller because the reviews recommended it - I'm a 36DD, 32"" waist, 40"" hips, and always a ""large"" - but the medium fit perfectly.  As others said, the ""boots"" are pretty worthless, but I knew that going in so I was prepared with other boots.  The quality is good enough for parties and such, and the price was great."
5.0,"Loved being wonder women for Halloween. I work at a elementary school so super hero costumes can be used often. ESP the cape. The whole costume was of good quality and the cape didn't hurt your neck as it velcroed behind your neck and had padding in the front. The leg pieces would sometimes fall down but I just pinned them to socks I was wearing underneath.
Overall I loved it and would consider buying another costume from this seller."
4.0,My wife is pretty small and the XS size was a bit loose for her but workable. The leggings (boots) also kept falling down. Good value for the price and super fast shipping! Material and build quality are acceptable though cheap looking up really close.
2.0,This outfit looks nothing like the photo when it arrives.
1.0,"Arrived and was a little big, as possibly expected, but without the belt, tiara, bracelets and boot tops that are promised on the description and the packaging!!!"
4.0,"The costume fit pretty well.  I'm 5'6"", about 165 and I was able to fit into a medium pretty well.  I have large hips so the skirt was a little less than flattering with all of the pleats, but overall, it was good.  The belt that comes with it is really big, especially if you have a little waist.  The boot cover things don't stay up unless you have something to attach them to but they look alright.  The cape and the other accessories are a little cheesy but it is what is expected for what you pay.  The top part of the costume is a foamy kind of material that does stay up well.  It can bunch up along the sides though.  If you have a larger chest, I'd recommend a strapless bra to go with it."
4.0,"Super fun. Got lots of compliments. Very bright! Definitely runs large. I'd normally get an XL in off-the-rack costumes, but after reading the reviews, I got a large, and even that was a bit roomy. But I worked with it because a medium would probably have been too small. Wore a boned corset underneath. Necessary, as the bodice has no real structure--just an elasticized pull up. But I was going to wear the corset anyway, so that worked fine for me. Cape is a bit tight around the neck, as some have said, but wore it all night and it was okay. Boot covers were loose and didn't stay up very well, but made it work with some wardrobe tape. Only thing that didn't work at all were the armbands...they are HUGE! Ha ha so ridiculously large. So I just did without them. But overall it was a big success. Bright and fun and lots of impact! The hit of the evening."
5.0,It was perfect! I wore it in a half marathon and it stayed up perfectly with my sports bra. I got a small and I'm a size 6 with a D chest. The only downside is the cape physically chokes too much and the leggings did not stay up while running. But it was perfect and adorable for the price!
4.0,I ordered a size M knowing it might be a little large because it is easier to make it smaller where needed. It is definitely made for a taller woman.  I am 5' tall so it was quite long. Otherwise It was nicer than expected.
5.0,"I really love this product. The material is nicer than expected and is nice quality. I ordered it for my Relay for Life team's Ms. Relay contestant. I read the reviews and saw that the product runs big so I ordered a size smaller than normal and it fit perfectly. The cape is a bit small around the neck and the boot covers are actually a soft material, not the vinyl looking material of the picture, but overall the outfit  is great."
5.0,I am my husbands Wonder Woman
5.0,"It was nice, but if you have tiny knockers, go a size smaller."
4.0,I should have gone down a size but it's still a cute costume.
3.0,"It is good for the price. I am 5 ft 8 in, 140 about a 34B, and a Medium was the perfect size. I don't understand why the picture isn't exactly what you get. The body part looks the same but the belt is a different material, same material as the arm bands, sorry I don't know what to call it. I didn't wear the arm bands because I had my own better ones. Head band is a good one, looks good with the outfit. Clearly the description says you get boot covers, not the boots in the picture, but they resemble the boots. I wore them over jeans and had to pin them, but they looked good enough for me. The cape part around your neck is different from the picture and was tight on my neck, kind of irritating, but it looks good with the cape. The top red part with the ww  was really bunched up on the sides. I couldn't pin it to fix it or anything. I wore a sweater over it because I wore it to school so it looked ok, but I wouldn't wear it out with just the cape. Maybe mine was sewn funny. Skirt was nice looking, shiny. Everybody liked the costume and I would buy it again because it was the only wonder woman costume that was appropriate (with pants underneath) for school. It doesn't look like the Wonder Woman I knew from the old TV show but everybody knew what I was."
3.0,I really felt like Wonder Woman!
4.0,"The costume was comfortable, fun, and received lots of compliments.  It does run big, so size down.  The cape is pretty much useless - way to small for any adult or teen.  It looks like it belongs with a child's costume.  If they don't re-design the cape, you'll need to purchase one separately."
5.0,Leggings were too small but everything else was great. Swam in it at a Polar Plunge. Double-sided sticky tape kept the top in place. Costume washed and dried very well. Ordered one size down.
3.0,"Its nice quality but. The fit is loose. I wear size 10 or 12; 38c, and its too baggy at the top.  Swapping for medium."
1.0,"Unfortunately, I received an opened package with 4 things missing in the package =("
5.0,"Fits a bit big, but can work with it. Otherwise fits great, got the reaction i was hoping for."
2.0,Way too large for me. I will have to return it for a medium. I'm a size 14 and the large is way too big! The arm cuffs are too big and the leg pieces won't even stay up and I have large thighs.
5.0,"Excellent,  delivery fast"
5.0,"This fit very well, but I had to order a size smaller as the other reviews stated :) very satisfied with my purchase. Lots of accessories included."
4.0,"It's a pretty costume, but upon reading some reviews, I was under the impression this ran large, it does not! I am a size 4 and ordered the XS and it was a bit snug. The skirt was so full, it made me look bigger than I was. That size is for a super skinny woman with no curves I guess. The top fit, but the belt was snug. I wished I had went with the Small. I did however buy some leggings with stars and a red shirt and designed it for myself. I did use the accessories with it and ordered a lasso from Etsy. I love the boots and accessories. I added red iron on stars to the bracelets, as they just stuck on. I got so many compliments on my costume. I ordered this costume for my grandson's super hero birthday party, so I didn't have time send it back for a smaller size to replace it. The price was great for all that you got though!"
5.0,Love it! Fits better than expected! Does run a bit large but the cape was too small around the neck so I made some alterations to make it fit!  Really cute!!
4.0,Pretty great costume
4.0,Fit around my chest but got loose and wrinkled in the middle.
3.0,The boot covers were to short and did not go over my shoes. Everything else was nice
4.0,"Except if you are size 6 you will struggle.

Accessories very cute for a cheap costume eg fake velvet boot covers - won't stand up to rough wear but cute for impression of red boots."
4.0,"The dress fits well but because the accessories (boot covers, wristlets, etc) are one-size-fits-all, they fit a little tight. I can't imagine they would fit if you ordered the extra large."
3.0,"the top parts and the bottom parts are different sizes, it looks good but the size is an issue."
5.0,"Very conferrable , fit true to size - I will be wearing this for the next couple Halloweens!!!"
5.0,"Bought this for a 21 yo for her birthday, who is an avid WW fan.  She wears a sz 8 but that was too big.  Returned it and this fits perfectly.  She has worn it around the house before and AFTER Halloween.  It is well made and what a GREAT price. No hassle returns too."
5.0,Nice costume.  Looked great
4.0,"Generally fits well and good quality, but the wrist cuffs are way too small, impossible to put on. Should be elasticated."
5.0,ready for the PARTY
5.0,great quality and fit
3.0,"Pretty good costume for price.  Like most of the other reviews I agree size is too large.  Definitely had to make some alterations to the top portion, I'm thinking I should have purchased size medium rather than large.  Boot covers are very poor quality, I ended up not using them because they are hard to keep in place."
3.0,"I wore this for Halloween, but before that I had to sew the back in. It was definitely bigger than than expected. The ""corset"" part of it was too big. It appeared that I had rolls on my stomach even when I was standing up. The sewing was falling apart of the wrists and the belt was a mess. It was a hit for the parties, but I worried about keeping it from falling apart the entire night.

My recommendation is to go a size smaller, even if you have a bigger chest and hips."
3.0,"Not bad design.  Cheap quality, but nice colors.  The skirt can be a bit short in the back, so watch out!"
5.0,Great
1.0,I hate this outfit and tried several times to reach Rubie's but they refused to acknowledge my return request.
1.0,"Too small, fabric thin, not what expected, returned it."
4.0,"Great costume to wear once or twice, but the stitching doesn't hold up to extended use. Very pleased with it."
3.0,"So normally I wear a size 11/12 and figured I'd need a Large, It didn't feel cheap at all. I felt like I was wearing a XL though which was not vert flattering... Next time I will buy a Medium. The costume quality wise was good."
5.0,good fit
3.0,"I couldn't fit. Xs was really small. Xs is for size 1,2.  The headband and wristband was really nice. The boots cover is not like the picture. It was for wedge heel."
1.0,I BOUGHT THIS FOR HALLOWEEN 2014 AND WAS UPSET ABOUT HOW SMALL IT RUNS.
3.0,"The top was large and bulky.  The way it was sewn made the sides bunch up and look funny.  The boot covers were way too big!  I'm only 5'2"" so my legs are short and I wear a 6-8 in pants so my legs are not plump.  I had to tuck the covers into my boots, there is no way that they would have stayed up.  The neck of the cape is made for a child...I could not breathe so I pinned it to the top I wore under the costume.  The costume is cute, but, it lacks attention as far as the accessories are concerned."
3.0,OK quality. Sizing is way off. We took the advice of other reviews and ordered one size smaller. Fit was better than if we had ordered to actual size.
4.0,"Great costume. Only prob was trying to rig the ""boot covers"" to fit my boots (& tried several pairs). I will use it again only will order boots separately!"
5.0,Nice looking costume. Adaptable to fit over clothes or without.
5.0,Perfect fit and all the accessories made the costume just perfect!!!! I got a lot more than I paid for!
3.0,"Liked costume quality, but very large, and neck of cape was very small, other accessories were also way too large. And I usually wear a large."
5.0,"This is a great costume.  Not the most high quality garment of clothing but will last for several Halloween parties.  I bought the size small for my wife who is about 5'6"", 125lbs.  She didn't have to adjust it with safety pins anywhere.  She normally wears size Med in shirts and 4-6 in pants and dresses."
5.0,"Extremely satisfied with costume.  I was very surprised about the great quality, it was real material!  The only part I could not use were the slip on leggings, they are very narrow for a large outfit.  I wore my own red shoes that were perfect with costume. Overall,  for the price this is a great value for the high quality you receive.  Much better than going to a store and paying $50 for a paper thin outfit!"
4.0,"I didn't know whether to order a small or a medium, but based on some other comments that it may run small, I ordered the small and it fits perfectly.  Looks good with a pair of black stockings too.

Shipping was slower than I am accustomed to by Amazon so the costume will be used for New Years."
4.0,I thought it would fit like a medium but it was too big for me.
5.0,"This costume is of good quality, looks sexy but not risqu since it covers everything. I got lots of compliments on it."
4.0,It was a bit large. Usually when ordering online the items are cut small. Bad judgement on my part I guess
5.0,Wonder Woman costume was a perfect fit.
5.0,It was for my grandaughter she loved it and she looked great in it.
5.0,The packaging was in good condition and the costume fit and looked great. It was the quality I expected.
4.0,"Fit bigger than I thought, but nothing a little sewing here and there couldn't fix. Would have bought a M if i knew. the skirt alone has soooo much fabric- a little more and i'd have a poodle skirt! other than that, looked pretty good, got compliments throughout the night. of course, wristbands should be gold but nobody else seemed to care or notice that type of minutia :/"
4.0,"I loved the costume! I recommend it..it looks exactly like the picture. The dress , the head band, the belt and bracers were perfect. The only thing I didn't like was the boot tops. Also it runs super big. I got a medium and I'm a full 36C cup, 5'5 and about 150 lbs and I still had room in the top portion. It's not too bad though. Get this 2 sizes smaller if you want a perfect fit."
3.0,"I took note of the reviews when I ordered this and got a medium instead of a large. I am either a 10 or a 12 in most items, so I was torn as to what size to order. I have a slim waist but I 'm curvy and I also didn't want it to be too short, so I got a medium thinking that would be the right size, since it would be a ""Big Medium,"" which is the size I would normally wear anyway.

I should have gotten a small.

The bottom half of the dress fit fine, but the top was baggy.  I wear a DD cup so this is not usually I problem I encounter, but the issue lay in the fabric the top is made out of. It's velveteen on the outside but the lining is this awful foamy stuff, presumably used to give the top more structure.  The top fit okay through the chest, only a little loose, but because it was cut funny it was very bunchy through the waist and the foam lining only made this bunching more noticeable. I could grab an handful of the elasticized portion in the back, it was very loose.  If they had nixed the foam lining I could have altered this to skim over my curves better but alas, the stiffness of the lining made it too hard to pin attractively.

It made me look like I had rolls because of the way it bunched at the waist.  Definitely buy the smallest size you think you can get away with to avoid all the extra fabric.

Otherwise a good costume.  I didn't wear the bootcovers because I wore red tights instead but everything else was at least okay. I liked the shine of the skirt."
4.0,I loved this outfit and got so many compliments on it!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the boot covers were not long enough to cover a size 10 boot at the bottom so a good portion of my shoe stuck out.  I am a size 12 and the medium fit perfectly.  Can't wait to buy from you again!!
5.0,"Very good the custom and fast
Shipping. I AM very happy.
Thank you very much"
4.0,Great costume. Better a little loose than too tight and unwearable.
4.0,Took 1st place at Halloween party
4.0,"Got this costume for my daughter (5'8"", 180lbs).  Bought the medium, had to be taken in by a seamstress about 1 1/2 inches from each side.  The material is elastic and feels a little flimsy, but for a couple of wears, it'll do fine.  Top feels velvety, skirt plastic.  Beautiful, lively colors; ordered Prime and got it in four days.  Skirt was decent length for such a tall girl, but since the material from this part is so flimsy, she'll probably wear it with some kind of short-shorts in case it rips of the wind gets a hold of it.  Overall, a bit expensive judging from the quality of the materials it's made from, but happy with the colors, length of the skirt and the fact that it doesn't dive and show too much cleavage."
1.0,Really a bad fit. The skirt was so long does not look like the real thing. I had to buy a new one.
3.0,Some what big in the bust area
4.0,The costume runs VERY large. Definitely buy one or two sizes smaller. The boots don't stay in place but overall the costume was  good quality and comfortable.
5.0,"Great quality, and fits perfect."
5.0,"This costume is so nice!! My only problem is limited to the reviews claiming this costume runs large -- what??! I am 5'3"" and 115 lbs - I comfortable wear a size 2. I ordered the xs based on the reviews, and it is too tight!! And it arrived today, day before Halloween, so no time to order a size up. I'm going to have to hold my breath for hours tomorrow but it will be worth it because this costume is very cute!

My advice: order your normal size (or better yet, a couple of sizes and just return what doesn't fit)"
3.0,The small fits like a medium and the boot covers are a bit cheesy! However If you spend the extra mony you can get the real boots on Amazon!
4.0,Big
4.0,"A very nice costume, totally feel like a superhero! A bit too big, should have ordered one size smaller for perfect fit, but with a little adjustment it is all good!"
4.0,"Bought for a friend who is about 5'5"", she is a 36 DD and typically likes to wear baggy XL t-shirts.  (She is on the demure side).  I talked her into this costume and it looks great on her!  As she is larger chested, it doesn't want to stay up, being that it is strapless.  She added nude colored straps which help hold it up, and isn't noticeable.  Also, the gauntlets are large, so fitted them with some velcro to sinch tighter.  The boot covers don't want to stay up, so added a small string of elastic around the top to keep them up over regular boots.  The cape neck is way to tight.  The costume runs a little short, so jazz pants or shorts are recommended.  All in all, a really cute costume for the buck!!!  : )"
2.0,"Cute, but the bust are is really too smll"
5.0,Had to make a slight adjustment on the cape and armbands but overall good stuff
4.0,"I loved the look of this costume.  The boot socks did not fit well for me and the top was a bit loose, although the neck strap for the cape was too tight.  With a few modifications the costume worked out well though.  Certainly worth the price.  I did choose to purchase a metal tiara and cuffs separately.  The ones that came with the costume were felt and rather cheap...I didn't mind though considering the costume was so inexpensive to begin with."
4.0,"Well, after patiently waiting a little over a week for this costume I go to try it on, expecting it'll fit perfectly, and it fits SNUG. I'm 5'1"" 120 pounds and this thing is SO tight. I was a little disappointed and regretting that I didn't get the small. But I'm still most likely going to wear it. The quality is great. Everything about the costume is what I expected it to be and more besides the size. A lot of reviews were complaining of it being too big but I suppose it depends on how you are wanting it to fit. I was hoping for more length I got as well. But it is an adult costume so I suppose my order is exactly how it's supposed to be."
5.0,"This outfit came with the cape, suit, boot covers and small velcro tiara.  Everything fit fine but the boot covers.  They were too small, but red boots completed the outfit for me."
5.0,"The color and material quality is great. It fit a little large but almost true to size. As with the other reviews, the boot covers could have been a better quality (one of mine ripped when I was putting it on) but they aren't as bad as the reviews sound. If you don't want to spend extra money buying boots to match the costume, the boot covers will suffice. I placed 3rd place in a costume contest with this costume."
3.0,Everything runs on the big side!
5.0,love it great quality
1.0,"It did not look good on me
I can't image it looking good on anyone. The top is like a felt.
Sending it back"
4.0,Tried this on at Party City and Went a size smaller as others suggested and fits great!! The boot covers have strange fit and not made of same material as pictured.  Overall a success.  I love that it was $20 cheaper on Amazon!!
5.0,"I love this costume! The fabric of the dress is good quality. The top is like a foam on the inside and velour on the outside and the skirt is thick spandex like material. The accessories are great too. They are the same foam material. The boot covers are very cute. They are a little hard to get over my calves but it's good that they are so fitted because it ensures they won't fall down or move around. I ordered a small. I'm 5'6"" 135. I highly recommend this costume for the low price and high quality!"
4.0,"Since most said it ran a little large, I ordered a small. I am 5'8"" and wear a size 8. It fits as expected."
5.0,You get a lot of product for the money. Can't wait to see my husband wearing it!!
5.0,"Great costumer for a great price.  I read that the sizes run big so I ordered an xsmall.  I am 5'3"" size 4, xsmall fit perfectly"
5.0,"Reviews said it runs large, so I got a smaller size. It fits perfectly."
4.0,Fun and different
5.0,"I bought this costume at a Halloween store in town and got a size small. It was a bit too big in the back area, too much loose fabric. I ordered an XS from this seller, and it came quickly. It is a well made costume, and it fit my body type perfectly. I am 5'10, weigh 155 lbs with an athletic, muscular shape. I have 34DDD chest and my waist is about 27"", with large butt and thighs. The XS fits like a glove, it makes the girls look AMAZING! I would recommend ordering a size smaller than what you normally would. If you don't, you will probably have to take it in. There was way too much extra fabric on the size small. The cuffs are a shiny silver neoprene material, they look ok but I got real gold metal cuffs that I will be wearing instead. The skirt is short but I'm going to get some Wonder Woman boyshorts and that should solve the issue. Overall it's a great costume, definitely worth the money. Just remember to order a smaller size!"
3.0,"Im a size 10-12, and i ordered a medium. I should have gotten a small"
3.0,"The overall outfit look nice, but the chest area is way too big on my D cup. Also, the neck is too small that I feel like it's choking me."
5.0,"I'm 5'6"" and a very muscular 150 lbs.  I was worried that I wouldn't fill out the bust, and that the skirt would be too short for my booty.  Based on the reviews here, I ordered a small, when I would normally get a medium/large.  My measurements are 36-31-42 and it was a perfect fit.  Literally.  Any smaller and it would have been too small.

The material is sturdy, and it looks really good.  I'm very happy with it!"
1.0,"The seller got it to me just fin- no problems with them- but the costume is not up to par. The top is not satiny as appears it is more terry cloth/ felt looking/ feeling. the arm bands do not look or fit anything like the picture either- they are foamy and not at all tight fighting, the collar for the cape way too small (and I do not have a large neck) and the boot covers- which I did not expect much from- are made of felt and are so big I can't pull them up.  I would not suggest this costume to anyone that is looking for something more realistic - and quite honestly just threw it in the trash."
5.0,Very nice material! Love. It!
5.0,Perfect
4.0,"as every review says it is big, I ordered a small and it works I am 5'11 and 130pds if that helps sizing. The small is a little big but wearable not falling off. Going to have fun with my family on Halloween!"
3.0,Actually the costume itself is pretty nice for what it is.  The bust is really big so the top half didn't fit.  I'm a size 14 with a 38D bust and it was loose. The material is scratchy but over all it's a cool costume.  I'm ordering the medium to see if that fits better.  I have a 2 yr old and we are all being super heros for halloween this year.
3.0,"First of all this is an excellent costume for the price - I was mostly sold on the fact that it came with the boot toppers (the other one I was considering did not). However, I'm not a fan of the velvety texture of the top part. And the top part is actually somewhat large on me, however, the skirt is a little too short for my 5'9"" height (that's a common costume problem I have though). I will still be wearing it though because its a decent costume, just those minor issues."
4.0,"I read reviews before buying this and everyone said it was horribly large and didn't look like the photo. Well I found this exact costume at my local halloween store and tried it on. I usually wear a medium size shirt, dress, anything, and the medium costume fit perfectly. The boots in the photo are available for purchase on Amazon, but I feel the boot covers that the costume comes with should be shown in the photo. They are kindof loose and goofy looking. I'm thinking of buying the knee high socks that look like the boots and wearing those with my red pumps. Besides the boot covers this costume is exactly what I expected and I'm happy with my purchase."
1.0,"I ordered this costume in a Large, because I am really tall, average fit and have big boobs that usually spill over smaller sizes. This costume was not just too large, it was huge and disproportionate. I felt like Fiona, from Shreck. The design is by no means flattering to anyone who is not model size."
5.0,"I really like the costume, but the boot covers are really tight. Other than that I got what I expected. The bust area is pretty big, but it's very comfortable"
5.0,I really like this outfit
4.0,"The only piece of the costume that wasn't quite as expected was the belt piece. Its a foam piece with gold paint on one side, and it is not attached, as it seems to be in the picture. therefore, it moves around as its worn, going either above or below the seam between the skirt and the top. I wish this had been a sewn on part of the ensemble. Otherwise, this costume looks great!"
2.0,Runs ridiculously too large!
4.0,Fits okay runs a little big but worth the money
2.0,"Bottom Line: the quality is pretty poor. The skirt is basically plastic. It just wasn't well constructed at all, even for the price.

I thought I could potentially pull this off for my son's super hero birthday party since reviews stated the skirt was long and the boot covers were pretty high. However, the top is very large and wouldn't stay in place. The neck to the cape was tight and uncomfortable. The skirt was awful and made my hips look about 3 times as big. It just was not good - not for ANY occasion.

I bought a Wonder Woman t-shirt with a cape that I was much happier with and the party was a hit :)"
4.0,"The bodice is lined with a weird foam stuff, so it was necessary to wear something under it for comfort's sake. Overall, the costume is pretty decent quality, apart from the boot toppers. Those things were a joke. They tore pretty much every time I tried to pull them up. You're better off just throwing the stupid things in the trash as soon as you get it. The rest of the costume is nice though, and fit pretty well."
1.0,"It was to big for what my actual size is.... I wear 12 and picked the large. The material was terrible, weird foam material. Everything was wrong with this product."
5.0,"This is a gorgeous costume that is well made.  My costume does not have a zipper closure but I could pull it over my head without it stretching out of shape.  The cape is light weight but I think it will be fine and sort of ""billow"" when I walk which will add to the aura of the costume.  The arm guards, crown, and belt are light weight but they are shiny and will suffice, however I did order metal ones to use instead.  I love this costume!!"
2.0,"Quick delivery, I'm a large in everything saw the other reviews and I decided to get a medium, it fell right off of me . The breast area was huge did not fit at all. But the costume looked really nice . Good material."
3.0,"A decent costume, but it runs quite large. I am an 8 and the medium was huge on me.  Take note of the large chested model.  If you don't have something similar going on go smaller.  In fact women with smaller chests should probably just skip this one"
5.0,Fits perfect! It has elastic in certain areas which makes it a great for anyone because we are all not proportioned the same.
3.0,Runs big
5.0,Great quality costume for price.  Was very happy with the material used and overall design.
2.0,"Size ran entirely too big and awkward fitting.  I usually wear a 10-12 and I am 5'10""!! I should have ordered a medium! The fit was just horrible!!"
5.0,Very cute. I am wearing it for a pub crawl. It is comfortable and should work perfectly.
4.0,ladies looked sexy
5.0,"Really cute and comfortable costume.  Used it for patriotic boat parade.....Theme was ""For truth, Justice, and the American Way""....with Capt. America and Wonder Woman"
2.0,"After looking through so many places to buy this or something similar, after reading the measurements and comparing my measurements I purchased this one, it is far to big, I suggest going a smaller size, I am extremely disappointed with the sizing chart"
4.0,Costume is great except kinda big. Got the small and I usually wear medium. Looks just like it does in the picture
3.0,"fit well I'm 34-25-35
but it started to fade on the back and the zipper pull broke after one wear. wore it a total of 3 times, and had tons of issues during the third wearing."
5.0,"Thankfully I read the reviews before buying.  As others have stated, this costume runs large. I noted that and ordered a size smaller than I normally would, and it fit well.  I normally wear a women's size large.  The medium fit perfectly. I'm also rather large chested though, so I'm not sure how this outfit would fit on a woman with a smaller chest size. I was very happy with the overall quality, especially for the price.  I don't think I could have made an outfit any better.  The boot covers were better quality than I was expecting, they were a velvet-type material, and large enough to actually fit over boots.  I plan to wear the outfit with a separate pair of boots I ordered, but if you aren't terribly into costuming, the boot covers should work fine."
5.0,This is licensed apparel and it looks very nice and has a lot of extra detail you don't find when you get a knock off at Party City.
4.0,Everything fit as expected except the leggings.  I really like the costume.  It looks great.  I like the shiny parts and the felt part of the body.  I wish the leggings were tighter or were made like pantyhose on the top so they would not fall down.  I will wear the costume and I will probably just have to find different shoes or boots or something.
5.0,"I am a size 18 and this was perfect, with just al little bit of extra wiggle room.  it was a big hit at a Halloween party and I must say it was pretty comfortable."
3.0,I am barely a size three and some parts were too small and other parts were too big. The material felt really cheap and this was too expensive when I bought it for it to be made from bad materials.
5.0,granddaughter loved this and it fit her perfect for her super hero party.  was great to have the whole outfit
4.0,"Awesome Costume.  I was a little large, but I made it work.  Wore it for AMERICA DAY in MEXICO!  It was a hit."
2.0,"As many of the customers said it was wide sized, I've choosen L instead of the usual XL.
I wear 38-40D sized bra in Maidenform's and Playtex brands and this is truly huge for me. I can put both my hands inside the space left between my own bust and the dress.
The overall appearance of the dress is nice and hope after fitting it sewing somehow it will be okay, however, the boot covers, belt and head band are ridiculously cheap looking and huge as well.
If you want this item, choose 2 sizes smaller than you expected and definitelly, look for options for the boots, belt & head band. They look terrible."
1.0,Too big and weird shape :( luckily I can sew or I would have been a lot more upset about my costume being a disaster
3.0,"I bought this for myself.  I am a size 10/12 and 36C - the large is way too big.  It puckers on the side of the bodice and the chest is very loose fitting. The top has elastic in the back so it would probably stretch to fit a size 14. The skirt has a lot of gathers, making my bottom half appear larger than it is, but the belt fits snugly with the Velcro matching up.  The boot covers are a tad snug on my calves so they will stay up.  The headband fits and is nicely subtle.  The armbands are fine, although probably hot as they are made of a rubbery vinyl.  I will have to have this altered to wear it."
5.0,"It is awesome, has all the accessories and is a great price. I got a medium and it fit good --possibly could have got a small. I'm 5'10, 130."
3.0,"I was happy with my costume, overall, but as for long-term wear...not so much. I had to wear this costume about five times for a production. There were a few things I noticed to be issues. First, the blue color skirt faded somewhat quickly. That was disappointing, as I needed to wear it several times. I wouldn't have expected color fading. The boot covers were ridiculous and I didn't use them at all as they didn't stay up and were quite bulky. The cape was quite tight around my neck, and I consider myself to have a neck of average size. The ""bracelets"" were poor quality and I ended up purchasing metal ones."
4.0,"For the price, this is hard to beat. The dress, belt, wrist bands and tiara are backed with some kind of foam. I think to keep shape & keep the dress from sliding down. The fit was good, maybe a little big even. I really don't like  the boot covers. The part that goes over the foot was constantly flipping up, and I have small feet. And the part that goes above your knee keep sliding down.

You get what you pay for. This isn't an investment piece."
4.0,"It looks great, just like the one on the picture however the top has to be fix since it is really big and the boots covers are really ugly.
The rest is very nice and valid for the price of the custom"
5.0,"This costume smelled like cigarette smoke, I had to air it out. Once that was done it was fit to wear, comfortable and plenty of space."
1.0,cheap and the skirt is way too long! I didn't even wear it in ny house. I think it's a piece of crao! The Crown has a misprinted Star
5.0,"I order an xl and it was too big and the leg warmers were too big so i made them thigh highs to give me an added sexy look. Over all the quality was great and I was very pleased, I roughly wear 12-14 so it was a little to big.  I was a hit in this costume.  Wonder Woman was every little girls super hero and I got a chance to be her. I received it in a timely manner and the price was well worth it."
3.0,the fit was good but it arrived with the zipper broken. I just used a safety pin since the cape covered the back anyway.
5.0,The wonder woman costume fit perfectly and was complete to the T. Everyone celebrated my costume and I enjoyed dressing up for Halloween this year!
5.0,"It's a nice costume, well made, no flare or anything.
The dress is made very good and the skirt is not too short. I really liked it"
3.0,"The costume looked good but was a little large.  After some sewing alteration to customize the fit, it was great from the knees up.  The biggest reason for the star deduct was the boot covers.  They looked good when we left the house, but after a little walking they kept falling down the rest of the night.  Wish they had a better way to keep those up (or you might make a mod yourself) and this outfit would be a 5 star.  One other thing to mention is they see the actual boots for this and if you are going to be walking much, that might be worth the investment."
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would! Dress is sewn crooked, too much bunching material in the top, wrist bands had to be cut to slide on, shoe covers don't work, cape too tight on neck and the belt needs a tighter option! All in all, horrible."
3.0,"I loved the costume, but it was HUGE! I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing the costume and many people said the sizes ran large, but I told myself that I would rather buy something that's large and alter it then be stuck with something that doesn't fit. So I looked at the size chart and selected a large based on the measurements they put down for the bust. It said that the large would fit those with a bust size of 38-40 inches, but the dress was falling off of my chest even though I wear a 36DD. It was also way too big around my waist and hips. I personally altered the dress and took in approximately 2 inches from each side (total of 4 inches). I also had to alter the wrist bands because they were a total of 3 inches too big for my wrist. After altering everything, it looked great on, and everybody loved it. But I suggest if you're purchasing this costume, buy a size smaller than you would typically get, and save yourself the trouble of either altering it or sending it back."
4.0,"The outfit tends to run big and also stretches, so an extra large will fit anywhere from 14-20 probably. I am average breast size, and I took mine to a taylor to have the sides of the breast area taken in, so if you are larger up top, you will have no problem fitting into this one. The downside for me was that the outfit is very square, and I am hourglass shaped, so it made me look ""boxy,"" although everyone else thought I looked perfect. It's plenty long and is made of good quality, considering it is a halloween costume. The extras that come with it (crown and arm cuffs) look cheap, so I recommend getting the gold crown and cuffs that another distributor carry. The boot covers are great if you already have a tall boot to wear them over, but if you're foot is larger then a 7, you will have a couple inches of your actual boot showing at the toe, which isn't really a big deal. Overall this outfit is great for the money, and for a few extra dollars, you can get the crown, cuffs, and wig and win that costume contest."
4.0,"Runs large. I am normally a size 8, occasionally a 6 but I got a small & it fit pretty good, just a little short but I'm 5'8. The boot covers do not cover your feet unless your feet are a size 5 shoe size or smaller. Got lots of compliments, doesn't look cheap, decent quality & the best Wonder Woman costume I could find that doesn't make you look like a cheap streetwalker."
5.0,Very nice costume!  Sizes do run a bit large so buy down one size.  The leg covers slip down.  Might try holding them up with a garter belt or just not wear them at all.  Either way the costume looks great!  Can't wait to wear it!
4.0,"Costume is well made. Fits a bit big so I would order a size smaller than you think you should. The boots fit a bit weird, but overall a really good deal for its price."
4.0,"I'm usually a 12-14 and this fit perfect, the skirt is longer and poofier than expected, so not quite as revealing as hoped, but still a hot at the costume party. For the $36 I paid, totally worth it, comes with the whole shebang- the headband, dress, belt, cape(which I do NOT intend to wear), silly boot covers and all. I bought a cute pair of combat boots that looks rockin with the costume (:"
4.0,"For a reasonably priced costume, this one is constructed better than most.  Decent materials, and fits well. It also looks in real life much like the picture, which never happens :)"
5.0,Well worth the money!  I will be able to use this costume more than one or two times.  Looks great!
3.0,"I ordered this costume and had to send it back.  It was way too big, in clothing I usually wear an XL in tops, I'm quite chesty and for jeans I usually wear a 30 or 31 I think that's like a 10 or an 11.  The costume itself was good quality but just big, the top was very loose and the skirt kind of ballooned out.  The accessories weren't great, the arm cuffs were shaped weird they were also big they fit around my elbows, the boot tops were big also they wouldn't stay up.  The price is really for the dress, I would have been fine sizing down but it wasn't available for Prime shipping :-("
4.0,The costume does run big. The boot covers are ugly. The skirt is longer than the picture. I used for a 5k and it was perfect.
1.0,"It's crap. I wish I could give it no stars. Def was not the item pictured. It was a completely diff version of the costume. Also the costume pictured fit me perfect in a size small. The one I received however was too small, too short and mostly just disappointing. No boot covers either. Ending up selling it to a teenager to try and get some of what I paid back."
5.0,"love this costume. fits & feels great.
however the arm braclets are a little big, they are silver I think they need to be gold colored to go with the rest of the costume"
1.0,"It looks to good to be true, and it is. I am  5'4 weigh 110 pounds so I am small. I ordered a small which apparently fit sizes 2-6. I am naturally between and 0 and a 2. and It did not fit correctly.
the cuffs were microscopically small and did not fit on my 5 inch wrists, they did not stretch either. I noticed scratches in the fabric as soon as I opened the box. The sewing was terrible, off center and it looked like I had fat rolls when I put the costume on. The fabric is terrible quality. Not Happy AT ALL. Will NOT be wearing this on Halloween."
3.0,"I was surprised how big it was. I am 5'3"" and 170lbs and I had to have a friend take in half a inch off both sides of the bodice and almost four inches from the skirt. I cannot wear the leg warmers because they are so tall they go halfway up my thighs and won't stay up. I had a friend alter it and now it fits perfect. I'll pair it with nude fishnet hose and some red heels. But be aware of the size issue. I always get a large in halloween costumes and I haven't had anything be so big on me. Granted I'm short but still it seems like it was meant for more of a 16X or higher. I'm a 12-14 so it should have fit me perfect based on their measurements."
3.0,"This could be a really cute costume.. but the sizing is kind of odd.  I got a size Large, and it fit in the bust which was what I was aiming for..  the material is stretchy so it didn't look big in the waist either, though the belt included is on the small side.. I can just about fasten it.  The skirt however, is too full and way too long.  If you have long legs this might be ok for you... at 5'3"" the skirt is so long, it comes down over the tops of the boot covers.... and there is so much material gathered for the skirt, it comes off kind of bulky.  I don't know if its worth getting it altered so I will probably return it."
1.0,THIS COSTUME HAS FORM FOR THE TOP PART OF THE DRESS  :(  THE SKIRT WAS WAY TO LONG.  AND THE SIZE WAS WAY TO BIG.  VERY UN HAPPY. SENT IT BACK.  THE RETURN WAS VERY EASY SO AT LEAST THAT WENT RIGHT
1.0,"The actual costume does not look exactly like the picture. The skirt is much fuller and is not made for anyone that is tall. I am 5'8"" and when I tried this on it looked like I was wearing a child's costume or that my costume shrunk...disappointed."
3.0,"The ""dress"" part was fine, and sized relatively appropriately I think, as is the cape. However, the wrist bands I would be hard-pressed to fit on my four year old. In fact, I think they are smaller than the mini wonder woman outfit she has! I will definitely have to pull them apart and put some velcro closures to make that work, as they have no give to them, and ripped open the first time I tried to squeeze them past my petite hand. Secondly, the ""boots"" are not as they show in the picture, a sort of vinyl texture. They are actually a faux velvet to match the top, and definitely not sized even remotely for an adult. I understand I have a size 10 foot and that may be unusual for a size 6 woman, but I wonder if these things would even fit a size 6 foot, and even if so, they would never stay up anyway. Another reviewer called them leg-warmers. Yes, after about 5 seconds, they are around your ankles. Ended up buying boots to replace that. Overall, I got the most of my costume here, but having to buy the rest and actually sew was a bummer!"
4.0,"I bought this at Party City today. I tried it on & instantly loved it, but it's NOT worth $50. It's ADORABLE & my shortness makes it look even better lol. It itches & the dress is uncomfortable. The skirt sometimes sticks together & the cape is a bit tight around my neck & the boot covers don't fit over my shoes & they slide a little. Also, the top fits in the front, but it's too big in the back. The cape covers that up though. I LOVE the tiara. I love the shininess and look in general & can ultimately look past the itching, price & size issues & say I LOVE THIS COSTUME!"
3.0,Okay quality I wear about a 14 and purchased the large. It may be because I am only 5ft. the boot covers are a joke.
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dress part of the costume. I am usually a 12 and since costumes run small I was afraid this would not fit. However, this is roomy and comfortable. Can't wait until Halloween!!! :)"
3.0,"The colors are vibrant, the general construction and quality were just fine for the price, but the sizing is so wrong.  I had read other reviews and knew to order the smallest size I could, so I got the X-Small, and it was still too big.  I am 5'5"" weigh 122 lbs, and have a 32D cup size.  Normally, I wear a size 3, 4 or 5, but I would say that the X-small actually fits like a 7/8.  I can keep this strapless costume up, but barely, and it is way too big though the bodice.  I have notified the company that sent it, and they have politely responded, and I am considering going down to the teen size or altering the size that I have.  Either way, just know to order a much smaller size than you normally wear."
4.0,"Outfit for school activity a perfect fit (x-small). I like it very much. Suggest underpants should be included.
Boot cover does not  fit properly, should have elastic to keep them up."
2.0,"The cape was missing on this costume, even though the packaging states it comes with one.  The upper portion is made with foam, so if you use this in a warm climate, you will be hot.  I tried it on for about 10 minutes and was burning up.
The wrist bands were very tight (and I am a petite woman) and are not tapered.  It's hard to tell which side goes toward your elbow.  The ""boots"" are socks without a bottom, and there is no way to keep them on your feet or a shoe.
It looks good, and if I had time before our party I would have made some adjustments to the wristbands and socks to make them fit better.  However, the foam upper would have driven me nuts after a very short time."
5.0,This is exactly what I was expecting (per one of the other reviewers information). It was exactly what I was looking for and worth the price!
3.0,"I ordered a large due to the reviews I read about this costume. I have to say that the material I despise. The skirt is too big for me and too long. I am 5'9"" 38C wear size large or sometimes xlarge in shirts and in jeans 13-14 and shoe size is 10-11. I am very curvy and thick and I weigh 215 lbs even though I don't look like it since I'm athletic. People might say that I look like I weigh 180; thus, the large fit me loose. The upper body part fit perfect since my breasted filled the cup area, but the skirt is too long and big. The skirt is made from this stretchy metallic material and the whole costume doesn't look like the picture displayed. The headbands and slip on boot covers fit me well. The cape on the other hand is too small and its made from the same material as the skirt. The cape didn't fit my neck properly it will fit someone who's a size smaller. The hand cuffs are way too small and didn't fit halfways. And finally the belt is made from the same metallic stretchy material as the skirt but it doesn't look that great. With the velvet material the upper body part is made of the belt slips up or twists and it doesn't hold in place. Overall probably it will be a good costume for a child but not for an adult. Instead of making me look sexy it made me look sloppy. I was hoping I would look like the girl in the picture since I almost have the same features as wonder woman but its a shame that the skirt makes you look unattractive."
4.0,"One key accessory was missing, the tiara! that is part of the overall look, so that was disappointing, but the rest of the costume was great. Since some of the reviews recommended ordering a size down, I got an XS and it fit perfectly (I was surprised, normally a size 4-6). The skirt wasn't too short, and it was easy to wear and dance in, for those worried about such shenanigans."
2.0,"Dress is a velvet top sewn to the shiny skirt. It zips in the back. I got an XS. I am 5' 3"" and 107 lbs, 32A and the top bulged like a bubble in the back and ruffled on the sides. Safety pins weren't enough- the chest was still loose and the sides were still bulgy. The belt was loose too, and attaches by velcro (with no varieties in tightness). The cuffs are loose, but not terrible- a thin, foam material with shiny metal fabric on top that are also difficult to lose their flat shape from shipping. Too bad they weren't just shiny spandex like in the picture.

Cape and boots are not as pictured- cape has a large, unadjustable neck (as oppose to the choker-like one in the picture) and just hangs back from your throat feeling like a loose choke. Boots tops are velvet with an elastic strap meant to go under your arch, and are also kind of loose. The velvet material makes it look Santa- themed. I wouldn't use it with this costume.

All in all, an XS is much too large for a 5'3"", 108 lb person. I wasn't able to tweak it to work. If you have basic sewing skills, then this costume would work. The top is attractive velvety and the skirt is shiny and not too short. It is definitely a more modest costume if that's what you're going for, and if you can get the right size. Order a size down.

I ended up getting Rubie Co's other Wonder Woman costume, ""DC Comics Secret Wishes Wonder Woman Corset Costume"" which worked GREAT

At least I could return it to no cost to me, which was awesome."
5.0,"I normally wear a size 8, I got the small as reviews said it ran big. good call.  the boot toppers, as other reviewers called it, are not so great, but hey, it IS a costume.  I plan to buy gogo boots for it later.
with the fact it's a costume in mind, it's great.  as I am short (5'2"") the skirt goes mid-thigh. but I like that.  I'm not uber-conservative, but I'm not an exhibitionist either.
all in all, it's worth it.
don't forget to check Amazon for a lasso. there's one for about $6.  goes great with costume."
4.0,"Pro's- Pretty sturdy material.  All parts are fabric, so it's comfy to wear.
Con's- dress is huge. I am 5'10"", 175lbs, 36DD and luckily I sew, as I did have to take in the top in order for the dress to stay on.  The boot covers were flimsy and took a lot of double sided tape to cover my own boots and stick on my knees.
Also, I did purchase the WW wig, which looked awesome and was worth the $20. Since I'm keeping the costume I am going to invest in the ""real"" WW boots.
I am a teacher and wore this recently to school.  The skirted dress made it appropriate to wear to school and I did wear a flesh-colored bodysuit on top in case of a wardrobe malfunction.
Everyone was wowed and the children and parents loved it.  After a couple of modifications, this costume looked great.  I will keep it and wear it for a long time."
5.0,Thanks so much. nice product and very beautiful dress. i recomended this customer. 100% secure. my wife likes this gift
5.0,I love this costume.  I received so many compliments while wearing it. The material is of great quality.  It is all well put together.
4.0,"Not high quality...but it is a costume.  A seem on one of the boots was not sewn together which I will have to fix.  As with other reviews, this costume runs large.  I got a small, but it is a little loose.  I typically wear a size 6."
2.0,"The package says that items may not be as pictured, and the boots were very different...made out of velour instead of the fabric pictured, and the white stripes on the boots had big red stains on them.  And they don't cover your entire shoes, just the tops..no heel cover.  The reviews I read here said the sizes ran large and to get one size smaller than you usually would, but I am a size 8 and the small was too small, so I should have gone with the medium. The skirt is much fuller than pictured, also."
4.0,I loved this costume but it runs big. I wished the skirt was not as loose as it was so I did some tailoring to it. But other than that the material is very good quality.
4.0,"Nice. The only fail are de boot covers , they don't stay in place.
Size runs big, keep that in mind when ordering"
1.0,Sizes do not match ... at all if you wear a small..... do not get this .. it is like 20 sizes to big!!
1.0,Sorry but sizing is weird; skirt is way too flowy. boot covers do not sit as pictured. fabric is cheap.
3.0,"Amazon sent me a XS when I ordered a S and did not have the correct size in stock, so I purchased this exact same outfit from another online Halloween costume site. Luckily that other site was able to get it to me by the morning of my event. This review is just on the costume, based on what I received from the other site...

I'm a size 8 and followed other reviewers' suggestions to order a size down. My chest is on the larger side and this still fit very well. The foamy tiara and cuffs are ok, but I purchased the metal ones and they were MUCH nicer! The boot cover things that come with this costume are a joke. I bought ""Funtasma by Pleaser Women's Halloween GOGO-305,Red/White Stretch Patent"" from Amazon to complete my outfit instead. The gold V belt is not attached, so it moved a lot during the night. I would definitely try to find a way to attach it before wearing this again. Another reviewer also mentioned adding a hook and eye closure at the top of the zipper, which I did because the zipper does not ""lock"" closed at the top.

With all the changes and additions I made, I ended up with a 5 star costume. As purchased, I'm giving this 3 stars."
4.0,"I am 511 and 160 pounds and a medium, which should have fit, was too big. Small fit great though!"
4.0,"Loved this costume.  My boot coverlets weren't an exact match but, served its purpose.  And by the end of the night, my belt broke.  Otherwise, I loved my costume & got lots of compliments!"
5.0,This is the costume I was looking for and it fits perfectly! I can't wait for Halloween.
4.0,"I bought this dress for homecoming instead of as a costume. However, it looks great on, for under $30, the quality is very good too. I wear a size xs or like 1 in pants, give or take a size, and the small fit me fine. it has enough room for a ""bigger"" small to be able to wear it(Claims to be for dress sizes 6-8), but it was snug in my hips. It came to about three inches above my knee, and yes, i cut about a layer off to make it more fun.

The company that i bought it from had extremely polite and quick customer service, as I emailed them twice and got a response both times in under two hours. Would recommend this dress as well as the company, I was very pleased by both."
3.0,"Really good quality costume but sizes a little on the smaller side, otherwise very happy"
5.0,"The Red Flapper dress was a great hit at the party. Many men and women wanted pictures with me and of me. Most of the older folks talked about mothers and sisters who used to be Flappers and how much I reminded them of pictures of their loved ones. It was a wonderful evening, one I will remember always. Thanks to the Red Flapper Dress."
4.0,"Definitely a great product, be careful though if you have hips. It runs small through the hip area."
4.0,"The ""Runs Small"" part of the title is very true.  I normally wear a 4 or 6 and I bought a medium.  It was fine overall, but there was no extra room in the thigh area.  Otherwise, very cute costume - I got lots of compliments at a recent Halloween party."
5.0,Everything was in great condition and the item was just as described!
5.0,Love this dress. I felt very pretty and the material was sturdy.
5.0,Daughter wore this for a costume.  It was really pretty!
5.0,It did the job for a Halloween party. I am not use to having it sooooo!!! short. But shorts pants was not an option.
3.0,The dress definitely is a bit large but  worked ok.  The quality though is very cheap.
4.0,"Cute, decently made Halloween costume.  Fit a little looser than we expected."
3.0,"Good quality dress for the price, but the dress description says the headband was included and the bag the dress came in said there was a headband but there is no headband."
5.0,Was exactly what i wanted
5.0,Love it!
5.0,"I bought this to wear to a 20's themed party and I could not believe the weight and quality of this dress for the price!  I did end up sort of pinning the waist at the back to give it more shape, but that is just me.  I think this style dress is straight and I like a more fitted look."
3.0,Normally wear a size 12 dress and the large was way too big. Had to adjust before using it.
5.0,"After reading reviews I did order a size up (i'm 5'4"" and 120lbs and got a Medium when I would usually get a small) and it fit very well! Was a great quality and although I did lose a few fringe you wouldn't notice at all."
5.0,"This item fit perfectly, not too short or low cut as the photo would have suggested."
5.0,"This was a great costume. I ordered an accessory kit from someplace else and I bought a feather boa at a Halloween store, plus some fishnets, a blonde wig and some great twenties style shoes. It was an absolute excellent costume and I won the contest. This costume fits well and is made well enough that I can probably lend it to somebody else next year."
1.0,"There's staining on the dress, it doesn't fit right definetly not true to size, smells k8md of like b.o.?,  and most of the strings are falling off or already off. Now I need to find a new costume last min!!! I tried this item on at a Halloween store but decided to order it online to save money. I really doubt it's the same product and even if it is it looks like someone else had a great time in it and then sent it back."
5.0,Excellent service and product better quality than expected
2.0,To small
4.0,"good dress, fringe was and quality was overall good, I liked the headband a lot, was slightly big but still fit well and I am putting a small black belt in between the fringe, I got a small and am 5'8 and 120 pounds"
5.0,This is a great dress for a Halloween party! I was nervous bc ppl said it didn't fit right but I got a large I am 57 and around 160 pounds its a little loose but not noticeable. The black color gives a slimming look and its comfortable. The length comes to my mid thy deffinalty a good length where I don't feel exsposed. None of my tassels have came off yet. The head band is kinda itchy bc of the squenes but I got another one from a set of accessories I ordered. I just got this bc it was a great price for the dress!
5.0,"I am 5 5 and 130 pounds. Medium size worked great.  I could fit into a small (friend had one I tried), but it was very tight.  Very happy with the medium size I bought."
5.0,"Choice 1of 3
Much better than expected. ..what a hit..
The head band i add  feathers to, the band could have been wider but overall very happy. .ty"
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,Ordered the xl and am a size 12/14 and it fit just fine. Great dress for the price. Didn't use the headdress as it's not so spectacular.
4.0,It is exactly what I expected!
4.0,Nice. A little cheap looking.
5.0,A dress for my daughter to wear to her aunt's Roaring 20's themed wedding!  My daughter loves the dress and it looks spectacular!
4.0,Took a while to get here. Fits well.
5.0,"Wow, Great Quality."
5.0,This was PERFECT for our murder mystery party!!!
3.0,A little to big but u didn't have an xsmall
4.0,"I was very satisfied with my costume. After reading the reviews I went a size up, and it fit perfectly from top to bottom. The quality of the material was really good, and I can't wait to wear it again. The head piece was really small, but it was workable. I would definitely get a larger one and that will make the dress really pop 4 star because the head piece was small."
5.0,Lots of compliments on this dress. A few fringes fell off throughout the night but not enough to even notice. Will wear it again!
4.0,I'm an xs and I guess I'm just really tiny because the red xs was just a bit big a just pinned it up. But ordered the same one in black for a friend XL and hers was short for her she felt. Different sizes different problems. Loved the look of it itself tho and got lots of compliments on the vibrant red !
4.0,I love it.  Kinda tight.  Have to lose some weight.  That's okay.
5.0,I love it!
4.0,I purchased this for halloween one year and it was a great product. The only thing I will say is it runs a bit long. Mine came down to my knees which was a little too long for my taste. I ended up trimming to bottom and it turned out great. The dress itself was very flattering and the accessories added a nice touch. This was one of the cheaper costumes I found and I am very happy with the quality. Highly recommend just maybe order a size smaller.
5.0,Perfect dress for the occasion!
5.0,Fine
1.0,The person who wore this before me had a great time in it. The fringes were frayed and different lengths. The best part....it was lightly tinged with B.O. This product should have been described accurately as used.
5.0,Perfect fit...great dress
5.0,"I'm a size 8-10 and the large fit perfectly. The dress stayed together through an hour of Zumba at the gym.  Lots of compliments on this dress.
Can't wait to wear it again!"
4.0,The dress was too big at the top but snug around the hips.
4.0,For the price it is great!  A little snug in the hips.
5.0,"This is a great item, but order one size up as it is really short."
5.0,It's a little short but it's beautiful!
5.0,Used in a play production and it looked perfect!
5.0,A quality costume!  Loved it!!!!!
5.0,"Great outfit for the price! Surprisingly, it is made with great quality and the sizes run as expected.  I received a lot of compliments on the dress."
5.0,As described
4.0,"Fit as expected, decent quality dress, got a 4 because of the quality of the headband.  If you buy this order a different headband."
5.0,this was a great costume and definitely fit as expected.
1.0,"I'm 5""2 and the small was way too long and too big"
5.0,"Fits as expected, looks more expensive!"
5.0,Nice for the price.

5.0,Wife looked great in it?
5.0,"For the price is great!!! Fit as expect, the long of the dress is perfect."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dress.  I wore it to a great Gatsby party and it was a hit. Great product for a great price. I went to several different stores looking for a dress but they were too expensive for not great quality And design.  This was perfect !
4.0,great fit
4.0,Lots of static!!! But good quality and fit.
5.0,Very nice and fit perfectly
4.0,"It was lose up top, but not made for hips"
5.0,beautiful on
4.0,Great costume for the money. Looks very good.
5.0,"This is a very high quality dress.  I do not understand the bad reviews.  A little low cut for me, but I will just pin up the straps.  I am 5'2"" and 105 lbs and it fit perfectly."
5.0,Great price
5.0,we ordered up in size for my mom and it fit perfect
5.0,Very nice dress just too short
3.0,Cheaply made but did the job for a murder mystery dinner.
4.0,"Fits okay. A little big on me, but I am a tiny person that can sometimes fit into large child sizes. Looks good :)"
2.0,Costume came used and missing the headband. Very disappointing. It would be nice if it was new and the size chart was more accurate.
4.0,Was perfect for the price and the occasion. The only problem was the fringes fell off relatively easily.
5.0,Very cute on !  Very well put together.  Wore it all evening and it held up wonderfully and will be able to use over and over.
5.0,"I should have got a size bigger, to be more comfortable in it. But it was a beautiful dress and greatly made!"
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,"Doesnt look cheaply made. Fits perfectly, highly recommended :)"
1.0,Way too large.
2.0,"I thought this product was very low quality, which is to be expected from its price I guess. I don't see this dress working for most figures. I have a pear shaped body with a small bust and a larger bottom (ie bigger hips and thighs) and it fit really loose up top and normally on my hips. With the fringe, it really just looked like a drape on my body and it was not flattering whatsoever. I also think the picture is misleading because it's only the dress and the headband that is included. Really the only thing that worked out was the headband."
4.0,Really cute and good quality for the price.  Runs a little big.
4.0,Super cute and classic in black! Great price! Just wish it had a little stretch to it
4.0,"Fun to wear... and comfortable!  Real flappers would want this dress... and it makes for a ""real"" costume.."
5.0,Great fit. I loved it.
3.0,Sizes run small.  I usually wear a small but ordered a medium and it was still a little tight through the hips.
5.0,"I just wore this for Halloweeen and loved it! The fringe did start to fall off when I took it out of the package but it held up well throughout the night. I'm 5'8"", 160lbs and the XL fit on the looser side but a looser fit is more appropriate for a flapper costume. The headband was great too!"
5.0,"While I say it is somewhat large, it is not excessively so.  It is actually more between 'fit as expected' and 'somewhat large'.  I ordered a medium for my daughter (5'8, 130 lb) and it fit her almost perfectly.  A little looser (meaning, not skin tight) and a little longer than expected.  The 'little longer than expected' was a positive as this costume was to be for her to get extra credit at school.  The skirt in the picture shows it a little shorter than I think would have been allowed for regular skirts in school, so the fact it was a little longer than the picture is a good thing!

While it came packaged in a plastic bag, the quality was much better than I expected for the price.  It does not seems as though the fringe will be falling off, which is good.

The dress is slightly low in back, but not excessively so and the front is pretty modest.  The straps of the dress have fringe on them (didn't notice it in the pics).

Overall, very impressed with the quality of this product for the price.  Very good value.

Will update with how well it wore while my daughter was at school.  She has to wear it to school for a 'prohibition party' in a class, so I will know exactly how well it holds up."
4.0,"I loved this dress! I ordered a large, I'm 5'8"", 160lbs and it fit nicely,  a little on the bigger side but I chalked it up to being roomy to easily party in! It was very comfortable and was a nice length on me. (I ordered another dress, same size and it was obscenely short and I would've been uncomfortable the whole night, constantly pulling it down.) I liked that it had straight string tassles (not looped ones) all the way around the back too! I tried 3 different online flapper dresses and this was definitely the cute, yet comfy winner at a good price!"
4.0,I love it! I am 5'5 and 140. I went with a large and it's a little loose but not too bad. And It's pretty comfortable!
5.0,"Absolutely perfect! I am a dress size 2, and the small fit my perfectly! The costume was a big hit at my halloween party and for work! Good quality. I did purchase another black headband when I lost the gold one, but still a great costume!"
5.0,"I love this dress.  I'm a medium but after reading the reviews I decided to order a large.  The fit and length were perfect.  I will be wearing it to a party tonight so at this point I don't know how it will wear.  It seems to be made very well so I don't think I'll have any problems with it.

Update..I had so many compliments on this dress at the party I attended.  I was very pleased and will definitely order again."
3.0,kind of conservative.  wasn't look I was going for ;)
4.0,it was a hit at the party!  fit comfortably and was decent quality for the low price.  the headband was a little flimsy (super small feather) but that was an easy fix.  it was cold the night i wore it and i found it surprisingly warm (that's the polyester).  anyways... it was cute and i'm glad it fit true to size.
5.0,Great costume! Fits as expected!
5.0,My daughter needed it for a school event it fits great.
1.0,I order the dress small and it's little big on me . No true to its size
3.0,"I am 5'9"", about 150 lbs and I bought a size Large which was way too big. The neckline was so large my bra was hanging out and due the fact that there is fringe on the shoulder straps, it is not easily modified. For this reason, I had to return it. Other than that, it looked pretty decent for $20."
5.0,Better than expected. Fast delivery
5.0,"I ordered this as an impulse buy about a month before Halloween, and I do not regret it. It fits exactly as in the picture (I'm 5'5""-5'6""and 130-135 pounds) and it looks super cute! I wish it came with gloves, but I will just buy those and fishnet stockings separately, making it still cheaper than comparable outfits at Halloween or party supply stores."
5.0,Just beautiful!
3.0,Costume was missing headband.  Can you just reship that piece without the hassle of a return?
3.0,I'm a size 4 and buy a dress medium. I was a little loose
5.0,Very good quality! Heavy and not see through. Love it!
5.0,Fit perfectly and was delivered on time!
5.0,"I was a bit worried the dress would be too small, but decided to go with my normal size (small). The dress fit perfectly! I am 34DD, pant size 26/27, 5'3"". It will work great for the 1920s party I am attending and you can't beat the price!"
5.0,My daughter loved it
4.0,Nice dress. Fit me perfectly. Does feel like a real dress not a costume.
5.0,"My niece loved it and is wearing it to homecoming with a theme of The Great Gatsby.  Gloves, hose and boa do not come with it, only headband and dress but a great buy and good quality."
4.0,"It's really cute but it you have hips, definitely order up a size. I'm a curvy size 6/8 and normally wear a medium. So glad I read the other reviews and ordered a large. Fits perfect."
1.0,I can't get it over my shoulders. It should have fit. I weigh 150& wear a size 12/14
5.0,Amazing costume I love this !
2.0,I need it for a 20's party in September.
5.0,"Just as described, thanks!"
5.0,"Loved the dress, as did everyone else.  Great fit!  I was very pleased."
4.0,If there was a XS available I would have gotten it but it should work okay with a belt!
5.0,It's a costume with costume quality.  It served its purpose for a Great Gatsby themed party.
5.0,Great costume
5.0,I usually wear a size 4.  I sized up because people said it runs small.  I ordered a medium and had to return it for a small.  The small fits perfectly.
4.0,"It's a little bit big on me, but I am very tiny and petite. I love it though! The head band looks super cute with it. The costume is definetly 1920's/Flapper looking!"
5.0,Great costume and fit perfect. Sizing was right on. Costume came with all the pieces.
1.0,The dress was to small it was not the color i wanted but it fitted my niece who is a childs x large
3.0,"I like the dress, it is just not a true to size XL. I am a size 14 and XL covers sizes 14 & 16."
4.0,Great deal for a last minute Gatsby party. Quality wasn't the best but it worked.
5.0,"Loved the dress! Fit perfectly! Im 5""11 and a size 6. Large fit perfect. Good quality, recieved many compliements. Head piece is pretty basic, just the headband and the feather. I fixed it myself but overall it was a great purchase!"
5.0,Love it
5.0,Very nice dress! Really good quality!!!!
4.0,It worked for what I needed it for. It shed quite a bit but after ordering and returning 2 other dresses.. I was pleased that it fit!
5.0,Loved my dress!! Fit perfect and looked great..it does have a bit of static not sure if it had something to with the weather but did not bother me at all.
5.0,"So I bought it for my kid to wear at the performance as a costume. However, the quality of this dress is amazing. I am picky and I realized I am actually going to wear it. It doesn't look cheap or costume-like. I ended up loving it!!"
5.0,"This dress worked perfectly for a Great Gatsby themed wedding. I am 5'2, 125 pounds and the small fit perfectly."
5.0,Fit perfectly...worked out well for the event...didn't realize it came with a head band with a feather.  I will send the other headband I ordered back because it didn't fit as well.
5.0,"Really good quality for the price. I disagree with the other reviews that say it runs small. I found it true to size. Also, I am 5'11"" and was pleasantly surprised that this was not too short on me."
5.0,"This was a great costume purchase!  I planned a surprise gangster party for my wife's 45th birthday this year.  I bought this costume without her input, but what a great purchase!  I followed the fit guide provided by California Costumes and bought her a size small.  My wife is petite.  She is 5'3"" tall and weights about 105 pounds.  The costume fit perfectly and she said it was very comfortable.  I had purchased California Costumes in the past, and had knowledge of what a quality costume they make.  This costume was just as pictured in the description and it was a great hit with my wonderful bride.  The costume held up well, and I was able to fold the costume back up and put it in the original packaging again and we will use it for a Halloween event sometime in the future.  California Costumes really does a great job.  We currently have three California Costumes, and I would definitely purchase from them again.  Their fit guides and descriptions are consistent with the actual product, and the quality can't be beat.  I have included a picture of us in our costumes...her is the California Costume, mine is just a deconstructed suit that I made into a gangster costume.  (P.S.  The gray boa, the pearls, the hose, and shoes on my wife's costume were purchased separately, they are not included in the original costume,but they really added some great detail)"
5.0,I looked amazing in my costume for my dance concert. It held up perfectly!
4.0,"There is another  layer of tassels on top. The picture shows just one long layer and the rest of the dress with a shorter length of tassels. On the dress irl, all the tassel layers are the same length."
4.0,"I read the reviews, thank you!, that it ran on the small side so I ordered a size larger for my daughter who is tall and thin. It is short, which is shown in the picture, but a delightful purchase!"
5.0,Great product! Just as advertised
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous! I'm glad I read the reviews to go with a size larger. I'm bigger in the bottom, but the top was a bit large. However that's okay because the dress is absolutely fun to be in!"
5.0,I am really glad I didn't go by most of the reviews. I ordered my normal size (small) and it fit perfect! It is comfortably roomy - not baggy or too tight. I wear anywhere from a size 0 to a size 4 petite.
5.0,"Bought the small costume for my daughter for a 20's night presentation she had to give at school.  She is 4""9"" and the length and fit were great!  Dress is very flattering and not tight through the middle or hips.  The headband with the single feather was fine - slightly small feather but she is petite and she thought she looked great! Added fishnet stockings, gloves, beads and a black feather boa (that never stops shedding!)  She looked marvelous and got many compliments on her outfit!  Ordered it with Amazon prime and it arrived in 48 hours."
3.0,Sheds.
5.0,"Fit was nice, not too short as most were."
2.0,Way to big. Wasn't very cute on me.
4.0,This costume is made very well for the price.
5.0,Great deal and fit
2.0,I'm so upset with this order! I paid an extra $5 for 2 day shipping because I needed this costume ASAP for a Great Gatsby party at school. I just received and opened it 5 minutes ago and I already have an issue. It only came with the dress and not the headband! Not only did it just have the dress but the dress wasn't even finished being made!!!! It still had some of the fringe not unraveled yet and it was still attached to a long piece of string. So upset right now because it fit perfectly and I need this by next Wednesday!!
5.0,"I got a size up from what I normally wear as recommended by the other reviews. Unfortunately for me, it seems true to size so ended up returning it due to it being too big on me. I'm 110 lbs and size small was too big"
4.0,great for halloween
5.0,"I really love this costume! Just a warning, the other reviewers are right about it running small. I usually wear a 8-10 dress size and ordered the xl thinking I'd need to take it in somewhat. It actually fit perfectly!"
5.0,Fits great. Smooth transaction. Thank you!!!
5.0,It worked for what I needed
5.0,perfect for my daughter's great gatsby party. :)  the medium fit like a medium.
5.0,bought this for work on Halloween. I also bought it a size bigger and it fit fine.  Great costume for the price.  Heavier than I expected.  Pleasant surprise.
5.0,Exactly as expected. Good fit and fun costume
4.0,"perfect for Halloween, don't expect high quality , this is really meant to be used just once or twice.  The dress came longer than the photo, but I hemmed it and it was fine for the party."
5.0,Great costume and received it promptly
4.0,"The costume was ok... I ordered a Medium, but fits like a Large. I had to fix some of the strings because it wasn't pulled out correctly. Overall an ok product."
4.0,Very cute.
5.0,Came the next day. Fit very well surprisingly good quality for such a low price.
5.0,Excellent costume
1.0,Outfit was a bit smaller then I expected
5.0,"As we are going to a 20's themed party, this dress is the ""cat's meow"".  Totally party appropriate!!"
4.0,This was a fun dress. It kind of falls apart and fits a little small but for a one knight it's okay.
4.0,"I purchased a large for a Halloween costume expecting it to probably be a bit baggy on me, but worried that a medium may have been too small after seeing some of the pictures others have posted (I'm typically a medium in clothing). I think I could have gotten away with a medium, but the large worked perfectly fine as a costume piece. It's a very simple flapper costume but I accessorized well and got a lot of compliments! The material is cheap, but that didn't really bother me at all, as I wasn't going for authenticity."
4.0,Came fast and was perfect for halloween! It was a little looser than I would have liked but it fit for the time period and I received a ton of compliments all night! The feather headband was by far the best part of the costume- so fun!
5.0,Absolutely love it!!  For the price you couldn't beat it!!
4.0,"NIce, doesnt look like a costume but a nice era dress. YOu will see the difference in costume wear. Great for the price."
4.0,"My wife is normally wear size 19 and this was a little large for her (5.6"", 153 lbs) Other that looks great."
4.0,"It definitely runs large, but honestly it didn't bother me too much. I wish I would have ordered a size down, but because I am so tall I wanted it to be a little longer. It works perfectly for a 20s themed party. Nothing too fancy, but still a solid costume piece!"
5.0,I wore this to a 1920s themed bridal shower and everyone commented on it and asked where I got it. It was so comfortable and so easy to accessorize!
5.0,"This dress was not only very cute, but a great price for a party.  Very happy with this!"
5.0,Great Halloween costume. Looks good on and fits well.
4.0,"I usually wear a 4/6 in womans but decided to buy a medium because of the other reviews. It was a little big but the length was good. Overall, worked out great for the party."
5.0,Great dress!!!!!
5.0,A little snug to yr body but it's very nice and affordable
1.0,"I am a 120 lbs and 5' 4 so I ordered the small. The body fits ok but the dress stops where my butt meets my leg! It is ridiculously too short, I can't lift my arms or bend over or barely walk without my butt being seen. The fringe hangs down so it's not that obvious until I move. Also the dress description says the headband was included and the bag the dress came in said there was a headband but there is no headband. I'm furious because it's too late for me to do anything about it before my trip. So i'm just out the money and still no Great Gatsby costume!"
3.0,"Cute,stylish,but  too tight in the bottom and slightly to big on the top."
5.0,great for the price and for halloween :)
5.0,nice outfit
5.0,"Great well-built costume, can definitely use multiple times. I'm 115 lbs, 5'5'' and the small fits me well (just like the picture, not tight, with some extra room).  As a reference to the reviews that say the dress run small, particularly in the waist area, i wear 26"" jeans and i still have plenty of room in the small."
5.0,This fits perfect!  And great dress and hairpiece!
5.0,"It's nice to wear a flapper dress, because I feel like Leonardo's leading lady in his ""Gatsby"" movie."
3.0,Sizes run small so be careful when ordering
3.0,"This dress worked for Halloween, I'm naturally small so it was a little big on me and the shoulders kept going down. Overall it was a great costume to wear for the price."
3.0,Love it got great reviews..
4.0,fit and made well
4.0,If you're curvy around the hips get a larger size. The dress is pretty straight fit. It is a great costume dress overall.  The feather headband was okay.  You may want another headband if you're looking for more glitz and glam.
5.0,"Too big for me but great service, quality and return policy."
4.0,"I bought this costume in an extra large, even though I wear a large normally.  It was still a little snug, but with some stretch it was still comfortable.  I got the black one and felt really ""Flapper-ish!""  The feather on the headband wasn't very large, so it didn't stand up much, but it was comfortable, too. It was a great costume for my dinner/event at a good price.  I can wear it again, too."
5.0,"So the dress is exactly as pictured and described. And I'm actually really happy with it. HOWEVER. Because of other reviews, I was afraid to order the dress true to size, since so many people have said that the dress runs small.
I am 5""5, 116 lbs, have a small chest and usually wear a small in everything. But I ordered a medium because that's what all the reviews said to do, and the dress is definitely too big. I'm actually fine with it, because it's just a little too baggy and long which actually gives it more of a genuine 1920's look (clothes kind of hung on women back then and were not form fitting).
So, all in all, I would say that if you are looking for this dress to fit you right, and maybe be a little sexier, buy the size you usually wear. If you have some time before the event you're wearing it to, you can always send it back and re-order if it's too big/small.
As far as the product goes, I'm very happy with the quality and everything about the dress. It smells horribly of chemical plastic, so give it some time to air out. And the headdress, as everyone else has mentioned, is sparse and could use some TLC if you're wanting a really snazzy headpeice. But I'm wearing it as is because I think it's just fine."
3.0,not the most quality dress but good for what it is. fit good.
5.0,I loved it <3
5.0,Happy customer 
4.0,Very nice quality. Lots of compliments.
5.0,It was great!!!
5.0,"I didn't get to wear it as planned..party changed but I do like the dress and will keep for something future I hope.  I am a size 4 and the SM fit well.  The SM did say 6-8 and in street clothes a 6-8 would be big on me...I'm about 108 lbs. I read the reviews.  I believe it did have an x-small which I  would have ordered since I'm not 6-8 but was not offered on the order page...glad because it would have been too small.  And, I'm 5 '3"" so it's  longer on me than picture shown."
5.0,It was perfect
5.0,I was blown away by the quality of this dress!! For what I paid I kept my expectations low. I was worried about the size but it fit perfectly ordering exactly the size I am. I highly recommend this!!!!
5.0,Fit well and was well made for being inexpensive!
5.0,"Very satisfied with this product. I received it the day before I wanted to wear it and was I nervous that it wasn't going to fit but it looked great! Plus, it was only $16. The only downside is that the tag tells you not to wash/dry the dress, only spot clean."
4.0,I so Love it!!! I though it was to much to show my skin but I love it!!
5.0,Perfect costume. Won first prize as a group as gangstas and flappers.
5.0,I am a size 6 currently and it was short and a bit tight but it looked awesome!
4.0,The fit is pretty true to size. It was slightly big on me but still looked very cute. All in all it was just what I was looking for
4.0,"Based on other reviews, I expected a snugger fit than what I got. I'm 5'5"" and curvy, typically I wear between a 10 and a 12, so went with the extra large based on what I read about this dress. I could have gone with the large and been a little happier, but overall a great dress at a great price. Order with enough time to return for another size if at all possible, since it seems this dress, like most women's clothing, fits everyone a little differently."
4.0,"It is a good costume--not sheer, doesn't feel cheap.  And it fit well, I ordered the large so it would be long enough (mid-thigh) and it was.  But the trim stitching was already unraveling at the end of the night."
4.0,"The sizing of this was a little strange, but it is a costume. The arm holes were a little big for me, but I think it would fit most rather well. Reading the reviews of this product really helped me decide what size to get. I would still recommend this product though. Its definitely a good buy."
4.0,"It was beautiful! Fit good, i ordered one size bigger like all the other comments and it fit, since i am short i had to make some alterations to the straps but overall it was a good product."
3.0,I ordered a small thinking it would fit because that is what I normally wear. However once I received the costume I learned that a small is a 6-8 and it was way too big. It looked great otherwise but unfortunately I had to return it.
5.0,"Used for a Halloween costume and fit perfectly! I'm 5'0 and it was right at my knees, which is what I wanted!"
5.0,"Great costume dress, a bit shorter then expected, but very comfortable.  I did order a size up, per previous reviews."
4.0,"Fit well, enjoyed the dress a lot!"
4.0,"It shipped right in time for Halloween! Came with the dress and the headband only. The dress fit me well, I got a small size and I'm usually a 6 for my dress size. I'm about 120lbs and 5'5'. At first I got the medium but sent it back for a small because the medium was too baggy on me. Very comfortable and the headband didn't give me a headache! Thankfully. Only problem was the fringes in the dress come off easily if they're pulled on."
5.0,It is beautiful! The dress really worth it. I just miss the gloves. But otherwise it was perfect
5.0,"I went a size up as everyone said... It was still a little loose but as a flapper, thats ok. I actually cut the bottom of it to make it a little shorter. But very happy with my purchase. I will definitely be able to use it again as well"
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter who is petite but is very well endowed in the chest and bottom area. So, we went with a medium since all said it ran small but we had to take it in by length and sides. It is very cute. I would just make sure you order in advance in case you need to exchange it."
4.0,"I went with a medium instead of a small based on the reviews. I normally wear a size 4 or 6. This dress was a bit too big for me but it worked just fine. I worried that the small would have been too snug. I'm 5'8 and the dress came to about 5 inches above my knee. The headpiece was comfortable, however the feather attached was a bit flimsy. Overall it worked and I got many compliments!"
4.0,Loose of the waist and tight on the hips so aftee reading the reviews got a size medium. It looks noce enough for the price.
5.0,Great dress! It is definitely worth the money. It felt like a high quality dress instead of a costume! I will buy all of my costumes from this company from now on. The size matched me perfectly!
4.0,"The dress was a little larger than expected. Sheer and very thin fabric, ripped fringes were barely attached, so I had to alter the dress a bit. Overall a good costume."
5.0,"This is the first time I've bought a costume online that I DIDN'T regret! I wore it to 3 parties, got lots of compliments about it, and I will definitely wear it again in the future.

One of my concerns was that the material would be cheap and the fringe would be too sparse. Neither were the case! I'm 5'5, 150 lbs, generally wear a size 10 dress, and I bought a size Large. It fit perfectly, but any smaller around the hips (mine are 40"" around) would have been a problem.

Over all, I'm very satisfied!"
5.0,"Bought this for a zumba Halloween event, and had many, many compliments.  We did have our Zumba class and the costume held up remarkably well through all the activity--I wore a thin pair of shorts underneath for decency.  I did a spot clean under the arms and hopefully, in the future, I will have an opportunity to wear it again.  After reading reviews, I ordered the next size up from what I normally would wear.  I am glad I did, as in the hip area there was no room to spare.  Because of the fringe sewn around the dress there is no ""give"" in the material. I would definitely recommend this costume."
5.0,Really cute and flattering!
3.0,It's way shorter than what it shows in the picture
3.0,"The costume came without the feather, the dress and the headband are fine."
1.0,Fit horrible. Couldn't get it over my head. They should really be more specific on how the sizing fits.
4.0,A little big but will do for the occasion.
5.0,"Good Fit, ordered Medium typically wear size 8 dress."
5.0,Impressed by the quality of the dress. It doesn't look like a costume it could easily pass as a normal black dress. Very good for the price.
5.0,"I accidentally ordered this in a x-large which according to the size chart is for a 12-14, i'm usually more of a 14-16 which would have been a XXlarge or plus. I didn't realize this error until after it shipped. I read other reviews which stated this dress ran very small and was short and even recommended to order a size up which made me nervous because according to the measurements on the size chart, this never would fit me with the size i had ordered. I tried it on anyways and I'm glad I did, the X-large fits me perfect and I'm not easy to fit, especially with dresses. I'm 5'7, a 38 DD and more broad across the shoulders with a rectangular torso, like no hip indentations lol but the X-large is dead on, not tight at all, i'm comfortable and have extra room. It hits about 2.5 inches above my knee which i wouldn't consider ""short"" with my arms at my sides my finger tips is about the length of this dress. The only thing I will say is yes it is more fitting around the hip area as this dress is supposed to be like a sheath dress, if you are more hippy or pear shaped, this may not work for you or size up. The head piece that is included is nothing special, elastic with sequins and a feather, kind of scratchy to wear. I ordered another headpiece separately and it just looked nicer and better quality it was silky and more comfortable. Overall this costume looked great :)"
4.0,Product came on time.  Is made well.  The headband is cheap but that's to be expected. Over all I'm happy and it was worth the 20 bucks.
5.0,"This dress is darling! I am 5 3"" 1251b, I read many reviews before buying. Its a little longer on me as Im short but it is above the knee. I got a little black belt to help lift it up just a little. I bought the medium but should have bought the small."
5.0,Love this costume. Fits true to size with lots of fringe!
4.0,Came quickly-fits fine
5.0,"Just as I expected. One thing that someone who is interested to boy this must bear in mind the price. This costume is really good, if someone want an amazing materials, can buy the expensive costumes starting from 50$.
It is excellent and fits perfectly its porpoise.
I highly recommend it."
5.0,Excellent fit
2.0,It was too large and had a gross chemical smell. Had to send it back.
3.0,I don't know what people are talking about when they say this is small. It was HUGE. Required alteration so that I could wear it; much too long and wide for me.
5.0,LOVE IT!
3.0,Average dress except it's very big for being a small. I'll have to have it alter it but it will do its purpose.
5.0,great!
4.0,Nice but my backside was to big. It kept rising up as I walked. I had to go up 2 sizes
2.0,I didn't get fur in California women costumes ..
5.0,Fit my daughter well
5.0,PERFECT FIT. GREAT COSTUME MATERIAL FOR THE PRICE!
4.0,"I really love this costume. I am a size 2, 121lbs 5'5 so it is a bit big but I believe the flapper dresses are supposed to be loose... I definitely recommend this costume."
4.0,Beware - some of the fringes came out of the package tangled and frazzled. I simply trimmed the frazzled ends.
5.0,Great deal for the money. I like things shorter so I put a black belt under the fringe and it looked great. I am 5'4 and weigh 135. It fit very flatteringly
5.0,Beautifully made! Does not look cheap at all.
2.0,"The sizing chart is completely wrong. I bought a large and it fit smaller than a medium I had bought in a similar costume. When I mean smaller, I couldn't even get it over my shoulders and I wear size 10-12. Very disappointing. Returning for a refund."
3.0,Fit as expected.
5.0,Nice costume but quite small.
5.0,So great looking.
4.0,"I followed everyone else's advice and ordered a size larger (I'm a small, so I ordered a medium). Unfortunately, I probably should've stuck with the small, because it's a tad large! The dress comes down to my knees (I'm 5'3) and is pretty baggy up top. However, I think with a few small adjustments, it'll be just fine. The dress is well made considering how little you're paying, and I didn't notice any missing strands or sequins. The headband is actually kind of a nice touch; I don't like it with the feather, but I can definitely repurpose it for something else sans feather. A great purchase!"
3.0,I'm glad I'm skinny or I couldn't wear it. But I like it.
1.0,I ordered based on the reviews and ordered a size larger than I wear. Way too big.
5.0,very cute dress! arrived really quick!!!
1.0,The costume runs really small. And there return policy is the worst I have ever seen. So I have paid for and outfit and have nothing!!
5.0,This is the dress I wore for our 1920 dress up on my cruise love it love it love it.
5.0,More than pleased....fit perfectly and pretty true to size!
5.0,Absolutely fantastic. I got an XL just to be careful and it's fits great. Not too snug not too loose. Pretty heavy material for a costume too. Highly recommend
4.0,"After reading the reviews I decided to order a size larger than usual just to make sure the length was okay. I'm five foot three but I have a larger butt, so dresses tend to lift up a little higher at the back because of this. Normally, I'm a M so I ordered a L and it fits perfectly! One thing I was upset about was that I had to pay $1.31 on top of what I already paid because it was sent saying it was only 1lb but it ended up weighing over 1lb."
5.0,Very cute. Not too sexy for office Halloween parties. Love the red color
4.0,"The dress is great, however I found it to run bigger then expected for a size small."
5.0,For a costume it is great quality! I bought the 8-10 medium and for me it fits well.  It is snug on the hips. If you are more of a size 10 you probably want to go a size up.
4.0,Nice costume for the money. Very pleased with the product.
3.0,It's very nice but I'm tiny so even the small is a little large on me! Wish it came in X-small!
5.0,super cute!
5.0,Order a XL were a size 14 it looked great on me the fit was perfect. I was comfortable the whole night..
5.0,It was better than what I thought.
5.0,It is great!
5.0,"Lovley dress, a little too big though it will work. I'm 5'1 and 132 pounds ( I got the small) and its comes to just above my knees and the top of the dress shows a little more breast than planned. Still it's wonderful, good quality and definitely worth the money :-)"
5.0,Nice
5.0,Really cute dress. Sexy but not slutty. Made for a super cute flapper costume. Would buy again.
3.0,It's ok hangs kind of low. Headband is flemsy
5.0,I took everyone's advice and ordered a size up and I'm happy with how it fits.  Can't wait for Halloween!
5.0,I normally wear a size 4 and I ordered a medium and it fits perfect. It runs small in the hips you can tell and if I would have orders a small I think it would have been too tight. So just order a size bigger than you normally wear and you should be good. Good quality for the price as well.
4.0,Loved this costume. I am a size 12-14 I got an XL and it fit as expected. Even a Lil loose. Not skin tight. It's pretty well made. Especially for the price.
5.0,"Fit as promised, and looks great! Love the headband. I'm a dress size 2 and it is a little long on me but fits great."
5.0,Great fit my daughter is a size 4 looks awesome well made
5.0,"Fits exactly as expected, not too small and not too big, just like baby bears oat meal it was just right :)"
1.0,"Cheap quality you get what you pay for. Didn't even end up wearing, I bought a better quality dress"
5.0,"Nice product, my mother loved it. Had to return because she liked another costume a little more."
4.0,"Greatly looking costuming. Very well made, but runs about a size smaller than what you buy in ready to wear. I wear an 8 or 10, but sized up to a 12-14 (L) in this costume."
3.0,I would definitely suggest ordering a size up with this dress. It was a little snug.
4.0,Wearable but a little tight in bust area. Fits every else
5.0,I loved this. It fit perfectly!
5.0,"I love this dress!! I ordered it for a ""flapper"" dance number and it is perfect! Based on previous reviews, I ordered the XL (I normally wear a size 8 or 10). The dress is a tiny bit large in the top, but hangs and moves beautifully. I will probably buy this dress again in other colors - especially red!"
5.0,This is a fab 20s dress. Heavier in weight and fit as expected!
4.0,"I am only 5'2"" and the usually fit a size 10.  This dress fit great.  Not too short and I am glad that I read that the dress ran small, so  I ordered  a Large. which well."
5.0,"This dress was perfect for the 20's party I went to last weekend! Before ordering I read all the reviews and decided to get a medium because people kept saying to order ""up"", and it was definitely WAY too big on me. Luckily, I had one more day to order the small and it came just in time. :) I'm 5' 5"" and 126 lbs. Hope this helps!"
5.0,"I bought this dress for a 1920's theme murder mystery dinner but I'll wear it again for Halloween. It looks and feels great! It's one of the most affordable flapper dresses I could find on amazon too. I was really nervous about how it would fit due to the reviews but I went ahead and ordered my REGULAR SIZE which is a small and it FIT PERFECT.  I'm 5' 5.5"" weigh 120lbs."
4.0,Please Oder a size larger it is short also.
5.0,"Far superior product than I expected!  Fit was perfect and being a seamstress myself, the quality of material and craftmanship was surprisingly good for the price!  I'll be back for more shopping"
4.0,"This is a great costume.  Nicely made,  fringe isn't too thin and goes all round the dress. Fabric is not stretchy. I buy a size 8-10 dress but otdered XL; the. L was tight. Bra friendly neckline that isn't too low and it scoops in the back. Overall. .a great costume.  Ordering this dress for a ladies dance group."
5.0,"Very nice, not much stretch though.. It fit as expected so stretch wasn't a concern just nice to have a little give just in case"
4.0,Great Price and perfect size.
3.0,Runs small
5.0,Better than expected! My daughter wants this as her Halloween costume and I went ahead and bought it when we saw it because things sell out. It is much nicer quality than I expected and she is very happy with it. It looks adorable!
5.0,Beautiful costume and very well made. I was unexpectedly very pleased and my teenage daughter had numerous compliments.
3.0,"It's about as good as the price. It's not made for curvy people, but nothing 20s was. The fringe falls off a lot and it's rather long on someone like me who is 5'3""."
4.0,I like it
4.0,Will work just fine. Thanks.
5.0,It's perfect for the occasion. And fits perfectly.
4.0,It was fine.  I am short so it was really long on me.  I ordered it big since the reviews said order up.  I did and it was good idea.  I would say that the model must be super tall because I didn't expect the dress to be almost mid-knee.
5.0,its a little to short but its because i have big hips.. but i really liked it
3.0,My wife had to pin it for our event
5.0,"I know some reviewers had some sizing issues.
I'm 5'3, 120lbs, 34b with a not flat booty. I bought a small and it fit perfectly! Alllllmost a little tight on the bum but was perfect."
4.0,"Great for the price! Feather fell off headband on the first wear, but other than that very cute, fun, and comfortable."
5.0,Just what I was looking for!
5.0,"Fits perfect, looks perfect"
4.0,"I bought a size up as recommended because if you are curvy at the hips is going be tight /weird in that area if you order your regular size.  It is suppose to be a bit loose so it was a good fit and hit at the event.  However, the headband was a bit disappointing, the feather was small and a bit cheap looking but it will do for Halloween or theme parties.  I ended up getting a better one.  The quality was good compared to other costumes and the fringes go around the dress and don't come out easily."
4.0,"I read the reviews that you should order a size up and I'm so happy I need! I generally wear a size small so the medium was the better choice. It is a bit of a short skirt (I'm 5'7"") so keep that in mind when planning on sitting much while wearing it. Otherwise, it's a great inexpensive costume with a cute feathered headband!"
5.0,"I'm usually a size 4, but in dresses a 6/8 usually fits me better. I got the 6/8 and found it was a tad too big, but it still looked and felt great!"
4.0,"I like the dress. It was perfect for the flapper bachelorette party I attended. Great price too. I'm glad, though, that I read the reviews before making my purchase. I usually wear a size 8-10, and the reviews warned that the dress runs small, especially if you have curvy hips. I bought both a Large and an XL, and the large was a bit constricting on my hips, so I kept the XL. The XL was loose for the most part, but I think that was a good look for this particular style. Totally recommend!"
5.0,Great buy!!!
5.0,I went by what other reviewers said and ordered a size larger than I thought I needed and it was perfect.  The quality was better than what was offered at our local shops but still what you would expect for a Halloween costume.  The price was also more reasonable than our local shops so we took a chance ordering close to Halloween and it arrived in time.  Very happy!
4.0,This dress is awesome for the price and I got tons of compliments at the 1920s themed reception I wore it to. I will say it runs small which I knew thankfully from reading the other reviews. I normally wear a size 46 but in this in the medium was tight getting over but fit well once on. Definitely size up. Otherwise it's awesome! The fringe hides a lot and the fringe goes all the way around which I did not see on a lot of other dresses.
2.0,It was smaller than expected and the fringe started falling off right away.
5.0,"Dress fit true to size.  It was short, but not too bad."
5.0,Perfect for a costume. Lots of tassels.
5.0,"The dress was really pretty and of great quality. I purchased for my mother, who is 54 and a size 10.  I got her a size L and it fit well around the hips but was very large on top. It wasn't a big deal, we just pinned a couple of inches with safety pins and was not noticeable. She would have been OK in a Medium but I mainly purchased a Large so it wouldn't be really short on her."
5.0,Really cute on and fits exactly as described. Even came with the headband that I was not expecting.
4.0,great fit
5.0,I bought an 8-10 medium I think for my 14 yo daughter. I was afraid that the small would b too small. I was right the medium fits great! The material is top notch! This costume is gorgeous and does not look cheap in any way! I love it!
5.0,"This was perfect for my 20's themed party I attended.  I'm usually a size small, 108ish lbs & 5'5' & the small size fit almost perfectly.  Super cute & would definitely recommend."
1.0,"Lousy quality, returned it."
4.0,Very nice
4.0,"Purchased for my 5'6"" 110 lb. 16 year-old daughter for her cousin's Gatsby party. The small-size dress fit her well, but her normal size is an xs-small. It looked great and she was happy!"
5.0,Came in perfect time and was comfortable and adorable
4.0,well made.  Just a little too small.
5.0,Nice dress
4.0,"Fit great, and was normal quality for a costume."
3.0,Returned
1.0,Too small says it all!!
5.0,This is a classic flapper dress.  The x-large fit great for size 14.  I received many compliments.
3.0,"my wife got this as a last-minute costume for a 20s party (gotta love prime) and it looked great. she said it was a tad big and while it didn't billow it definitely wasn't form fitting so if that's what you're looking for, go a size down. it wasn't shipped in the greatest container but there weren't any noticeable imperfections. my wife has actually worn this to other functions so if you get the right size, it's a great item. she was worried it would be really uncomfortable but she said it wasn't scratchy at all."
4.0,After reading all the reviews I was able to order the correct size.  The dress fit great and worked great for the party that I needed it for.
5.0,"I read the reviews, im a small size and i ordered a Medium, and it fit perfect on me!"
4.0,"Make sure to order a size larger than you normally would!  I'm generally a size 4 in a dress, which would be a small.  I took the advice of other reviews and ordered a medium.  The medium was almost too small as well.  It fit great on top (I'm smaller on top), but was snug through the hips.  But overall it looked great!  The fringe wasn't fraying and didn't fall off.  The headpiece did leave some to be desired, the feather didn't flop, but it was a scrawny little feather.  I recommend getting more feathers and gluing them to the band so you have a fuller headpiece. It was a quality costume, the only issue being the sizing, but since I ordered a size up it wasn't a problem.  I added a photo for those still questioning (I'm the blonde)."
5.0,Loved the flapper dress and won 1st place in costume :-)
2.0,Both small and medium sizes were too small and very unlike any typical sizing.
2.0,Both the small and medium were too small.  Very unlike typical sizing!
5.0,I'm about 5'1 and 116 lbs. I read some reviews and decided to order a medium instead of a small and that was the right choice. Besides the straps being a little too long so the dress hung too low on me (I'm a curvy girl!) it was fantastic. I wore it to a costumed event and everyone thought I looked great! Even random guests came over to take pictures with me! I would absolutely buy from them again.
4.0,"I usually wear small/medium size, but after reading the reviews, i bought the extra large: best thing i ever did. The medium or large would not fit like the extra large. Especially if you have hips.
The dress was quite nice for the price."
5.0,It still worked out great! It was even Warm!
3.0,It's a costume... Not something to wear to a really nice party... Fun for a costume party though.
5.0,"Fit kinda of small had to lose a couple of pounds before the  event because of it but it was very cute.  Received a lot of compliments, also VERY WELL made, not cheap at all. was comfortable once I lost a couple of pounds because it has a stretchy character to it.  Recommend."
5.0,Fringe goes all the way around.  It'perfect!
4.0,It fit the way I thought it would I was pleased with it:)
5.0,Great looking dress. It was a hit at the Great Gatsby event I went to.
1.0,I have to return
5.0,"the flapper costume is good,,it fits a bit large but looks good anyways"
3.0,Runs small. It's hard to find a costume that fits trus to size. I like the design though. I am keeping it for the slimmer days!
4.0,I normally wear a size 6 or 8 and ordered the large based on other's reviews. Glad I did...there is no room to spare but it is cute and will work just fine for a costume.
4.0,"One of the better quality Halloween costumes I've found, however like all other costumes, this too runs too small."
4.0,"Love this dress, but size up! I ordered according to their size charts and this fit like a sausage casing."
4.0,"Runs large. Great quality, received tons of compliments!"
5.0,"Based on other reviews, I bought one size up, and it fit perfectly! The costume held together pretty well considering the price (only a few fringe pieces have fallen off), and I will be able to reuse. I got tons of compliments at the costume party I wore this to, and the headband rocks! Would definitely purchase again."
5.0,Dress was very nice for the money. Actually it didn't even look like a costume it looked like the real thing.  Well worth the money.  I wear a size 10 but ordered a small and it fit.  Had a lot of compliments on it at our Roaring 20s Dance.  Will come back if I ever need another costume.
1.0,Medium fit like a small on bottom and large on top. Wasnt too happy with it but i cut it up and fixed it to fit correctly.
5.0,Beautiful dress. Well made. Was surprised that it fit as well as it did.
5.0,I bought it for my mother in law and she loved it!
4.0,Nice dress great price.
5.0,I usually wear a small (I am 5'3 and 118 lbs) but read the other reviews. So glad I listened and bought the medium. It is snug in the hip area.
4.0,The costume was a good fit. Thank you.
5.0,All I can say is perrrrrfect!
4.0,I loved this costume and I appreciate it fitting so well for a costume.
4.0,"Perfect for the party but unlike the other reviewers, it ran a little big on me. I had to take it in to make it work. The headpiece was a little thin and cheap for my taste; I got a different one locally."
1.0,"Very flimsy material, came open in the seams and fringes fell off when unpacking. Total waste!!"
4.0,Good quality considering the great price I paid. I was pleasantly surprised by that.  I will be able to utilize it many times.
5.0,on time very happy......well packed and exactly like picture
4.0,"Similar to other reviewers, the dress is a much better quality than expected for a costume. Its a little too short (which I think was the intent for this style of dress) for my comfort, but nothing a pair of tights can't fix."
4.0,"It's not SUPER well made, but for a costume, it's pretty good and the price was right!"
4.0,"Glad I read the reviews. I wear a size small but read the reviews and ordered a medium.  I carry all my weight in my thighs, hips and butt. I am very glad I ordered a medium! Great dress for the price."
3.0,"The dress is very nice. I usually could fit in M or L but to make sure it is not too short, I go for XL which is a little too long but I think it is better than too short. The material is good. It does not look cheap. However, the head piece is poor quality. It was torn off when I wanted to try it for the first times. However I just sew it back together so it is ok now. And the feather is very small. I would have rate it higher if the head piece is better quality."
4.0,"This fit great, was work appropriate, and it won me the office costume contest! Easy to accessorize and I made it through a busy work day with no mishaps. Only complaint is that the fringe drops off like flies, you could follow me by the trail of little black strings I left behind."
4.0,"But not bad! A few of the strings fell off as the night wore on, but for the price...definitely worth it."
4.0,"I took everyone's advice and ordered a size larger - I'm typically a sz 6 so I ordered a large - it was quite baggy on me and I think I could have done the medium.  Otherwise, for the price, it was perfect for all intentions!"
4.0,Runs a little small but loved the outfit.
5.0,I love it and it fit perfectly
4.0,Glad I ordered the next size up on this it is smaller than the sizing info given. Was perfect for the 1920's party and the tassels didn't fall off like I thought i would.
1.0,terrible shape and super unflattering. it's basically a tube. the dress doesn't cut in at the waist.
5.0,"For the price, it's awesome. I don't know why everybody thinks it runs small. I got a size xl because I read the reviews about the sizing being small. Yeah- it doesn't stretch, but it seems like it was made to be loose. Mine fits like a tent. I usually wear a medium in everything, and I don't think this is any different. Going to return it for a med."
5.0,"Following the advise of other reviewers I ordered one size larger than the measurements called for and it fits great!  There is no flexibility through the hip, but for the price the construction is great."
4.0,"I wore this dress for a Great Gatsby-themed party, and it did its job.  The size large was a good fit for my size 8 body.  The dress says the large fits 10-12, but it fit me pretty well.  I couldn't have imagined the medium fitting me correctly.  The quality is okay for what you're paying.  The headband kinda sucked, but I found something else to go with it."
5.0,very beautiful costume; I wear size 8-10 and ordered size L; It lso comes with headband; Has some black sequins on neckline; flowy and pretty
4.0,Great fit and completed my Halloween flapper look!
4.0,"Pretty nice, but it cut small in the hips and booty region."
3.0,The material underneath fits very snug. You definitely should order a size or two up.
5.0,The shipping was extremely fast and the dress fit better than I expected.
4.0,"I love the costume. Great material. However, If you are curvy, by the next size up."
5.0,This dress looked fabulous and it fit just perfect.
5.0,Great costume!
5.0,The dress was perfect for our Roaring 20s Christmas party. I can't wait to wear it again next year for Halloween!
5.0,Such a cute dress fit perfectly :)
5.0,My daughter needed this for a costume party.  It was perfect! great price!
3.0,Quite short...but was still a great outfit.
4.0,This is nice for a costume. The fit was nice. It fits a variety of figure shapes well.
2.0,I am returning.  Will be in the mail tomorrow.
4.0,"I am a size 6-8 in most clothing, at 5'4"" height, and weighing in at 125 lbs, but I struggled to get into and out of this outfit!  Ended up buying the Large which worked just fine."
5.0,Nice
2.0,"After reading reviews at how small it ran, I ordered large and xl.  I wear a medium, but sometimes large because of bust.  this was NOT a large at any part.  I returned this and kept the XL."
4.0,"Like many others have said, plan on ordering a size larger. I usually wear a medium or size 8/9. The large costume I ordered would have worked but I found another that fit better. This outfit is very cute and hides your bulky parts well."
5.0,Lov it
4.0,"Somewhat large on the shoulders and a little too long large would have probably been a little tight on the hips, but overall did the work!"
5.0,Very happy with the purchase.  Fit true to size.  I wear medium size 10 clothes.  My hip and chest are same measurments. I could have gone with a medium or large but decided on large because I wanted a looser fit instread of a snug fit.  Tried  on the dress and it was very nice..Just loose enough to feel comfortable.  As long as your hips  are not disproportionately out of place compared to your chest...the dress will fit true to the size you normally wear.  If you are in between sizes like I am..i suggest going with the larger size because flapper dresses are supposed to hang loose not hug your curves.
3.0,"Their size description had a medium being an 8/10 in womens. this is typically what i wear (usually an 8) and i could barely get the dress over my bust and hips. still managed to wear it, just didn't do much bending."
5.0,"I needed a 1920s costume for a fancy dress ball and was thrilled with this dress. It fits true to size and looks really good for being ""just a costume"". I wore it as my Halloween costume in addition to the fancy dress ball because it was such a good dress for the fancy dress ball.

The headband I can take or leave. It doesn't seem to want to cooperate with my hair. But I wasn't buying it for the headband. I was buying it for the dress. The headband is an unexpected bonus."
5.0,"For the price, you can't beat this costume. I ordered an XL bc I wanted to be as comfy as possible. Regular Large usually fits me perfectly with wiggle room to spare. This XL dress fit and I was able to dance fine, but it was still a lot tighter than I was hoping.
Also, it was a little bit see through. I wore it at night and I was fine, but if you're going to be someplace well-lit, I recommend wearing a short slip."
3.0,Fits somewhat tight. If I were ordering again I would order an XL. I normally wear an 8-10
5.0,"I got this for a Halloween party but the dress fits so well that I am thinking I can probably use it in the next party. Good quality and nice looking, as shown on the picture"
5.0,The dress was so well made and it fit perfect... I was impressed that it had better fabric then the one sold at PartyCity and for half the price..
5.0,"Was so comfortable and looked great!  Fit may be just slightly larger than expected which worked great for me.  I need a little more room in the hips and was worried this would be tight.  The small was perfect!  I have 37"" hips."
3.0,Fit is extra small.... Beware. I wear 4-6 pants and this just fit.
4.0,It's a little bit too big. I was afraid to go smaller but I will make it work. It's just for one time!!
4.0,Got lots of complements when I wore this for Halloween.
4.0,"I recently wore this for Halloween and then for a '20s party I attended the following weekend. I am 5'4"" with size 34 bust and 35 hips. The costume fit perfectly except for being slightly loose on the top (don't bend straight over!). The dress was quite fitted in the hips, so I wouldn't recommend a small to anyone with hips larger than 35 or possibly 36 inches. No stretch. The length was great, and not so short that I felt uncomfortable. I haven't lost any of the fringe, so it seems to be attached well. I had to fix a thread along one of the shoulder straps where some sequins were sticking out, but that was easy."
2.0,"The size small is for sizing 0-2, not 4-6. I was also extremely disappointed when I took the headband out & it was already broken. Had to send everything back."
5.0,The dress looks gorgeous on.  Once you figure out your size the dress is marvelous! Runs a bit small.
5.0,"I had seen a review that the dress ran a little small, so I ordered one size larger, and it was perfect!  LOVE IT!!"
5.0,It was great!
5.0,love it
5.0,"I am 5'7"" and 140 lbs. I usually wear between a small and medium in things. I ordered the large and it fit perfectly. It came fast and I absolutely loved it for the Halloween party I attended."
3.0,Keep getting threads fall off from dress.
4.0,"The costume is awesome. I read reviews and ordered a medium, even though I normally wear smalls. The medium was much too big. I exchanged for a small. The small was even too big. So I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say it runs way small!"
4.0,Smaller than expected
5.0,This dress fit perfect and I got a lot of compliments at the Halloween party I was at. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,"I bought a L and it fitted me but I normally wear M so you should definitely buy a larger size than usual.
The costume was nice."
5.0,"The reviews stated to order a size up but that ended up being too large for me. The quality of the costume was good though, the cost was great and the free overnight shipping was amazing!  It was a great deal."
4.0,This dress looks and fits really well. I ordered a size larger based on the reviews and it turned out to be a good call.
2.0,"If you have slim body and small chest, I don't think this will be good on you.  The top part is really loose, but half way down from waist is just perfect.  Still, you can't wear it nicely because the dress looks too big on the top part. Too bad I have to return it."
5.0,"I really enjoyed this fun dress. I was very glad I read the other reviews, as it does run small. I am a size 6 and would usually have ordered a medium but the large fit perfectly. I had plenty of room to move and dance and it just touched at my hips. A great buy and fast delivery!"
5.0,very nice fringe all the way around
5.0,Perfect fit!
4.0,"The dress only fit as expected because I read previous reviews. I ordered a size large and it fit great! I'm 5'9"" and about 160 lbs. The dress was a perfect length, not too short. It was really cute and I would highly recommend it for someone looking for a 20s dress"
5.0,"I did read the reviews and ordered a larger size and it fit fine.  I was worried that it was going to be too short, but again, with the larger size the hem fell about an inch above the knee.  There is not much stretch to it because of rows of fringes. I loved the movement of all the fringes! It was an excellent bargain."
3.0,"I'm average height and wasn't able to sit down all night because the dress was so short. I had to dig out some old fishnets to wear to help remedy the situation. Also, if your breasts are larger than average, the fringe won't cover all of it, but I hid it easily with a boa."
5.0,"This is awesome for the price and it was delivered really fast. I am usually a large (on the smaller side of large though), so I ordered an X-Large based on the other reviews. Fits perfect in the hips and a little big under the arms. That doesn't bother me though."
4.0,I ordered this costume seeing on the reviews that it might fit small. I ordered one size up and it fits me too large so I will be pinning mine. Over all I do really like it though!
5.0,Really very nice. Especially for a costume!  Great all around I'm happy
5.0,This costume was cute but if I wouldnt have read the other reviews It would have never fit.
4.0,"After reading the interviews decided to order a size up, shouldn't have, it fits me all right, loosely, if I had ordered it small (I'm 5 ft 115lbs) it would have looked much better. Quality is fine."
3.0,"Looks good... I knew it would be smaller than expected but I recommend going up 2 sizes. I am small 4-6 and ordered a medium which said fit 8-10.... but it really fit like a,size 4."
4.0,"I think I may have lost weight because I ordered a medium from everyone's advice to order bigger. The dress is a tad too large, but luckily it doesn't really show because of the style of dress. I would probably order bigger if you're worried about sizing because it won't be too obvious if it's too big.
I needed it to wear out to a costume party as well as with small children at a pumpkin carving event and it was perfect!"
4.0,"Usually I'm a large but I read the reviews before ordering, so I ordered a size up. Glad I did! Was still snug around the hips."
5.0,This dress fit really well on me and worth buying.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I normally wear Medium size but this dress runs a little small so I went with the large size and it worked out well.
4.0,After reading the reviews I decided to order one size larger. It fits perfect. I am very happy will this dress and well worth the price!
5.0,Fits great and arrived quickly!
3.0,"I didn't like the look of the dress on me but the quality of the product is fine.
The dress fits slightly looser than my expectation. doesn't come with the gloves or the fur"
5.0,"Fit well, great quality for the money. Very satisfied!"
5.0,very good
4.0,"I typically wear a small but ordered a medium based on other reviewers saying this costume ran small. I was very glad I did, as the medium fits perfectly. Quality is fine for a costume."
5.0,"I love this costume! I ordered it on Monday and it was delivered on Friday with regular shipping. I was surprised by how good the quality of the dress was...As other reviews have stated, it does run a little small through the hip area...not uncomfortable, just a little snug. I'm 5'3 and 150...I ordered the large and I'm happy with the length as it hits me about an inch or so up from my knee. Couldn't be happier!"
1.0,This item was way too small.  I would advise people to get two sizes larger.
5.0,"I would recommend it. I plan to wear it for Halloween. It is also well made, better than expected."
3.0,Didn't fit how I expected.
3.0,I original ordered the XL which was way too big...almost 3 sizes too big.  So I ordered the large....I couldn't even get it over my head.  Not true to size.  Order bigger and make adjustments to it.  Not true to size
3.0,I read reviews saying the dress got small so I ordered a Large. I think a medium would have fit better around the sides. I'm excited to wear it as my halloween costume!
4.0,I am a size 2-4 and required a medium because I had a feeling this dress would run small. I was right! This medium fits me perfectly so I am glad I ordered it instead if small which I would wear in anything else. The dress is adorable!
5.0,It was perfect!
5.0,"My daughter loves her costume!  Thanks, it's great quality too!!"
3.0,"Very cute but runs very small, mostly in the hip.  It was labeled Large but fit more like a, Junior's large. My friend was able to wear it and I even temporarily adjusted the length of shoulder so my 10 yr old could wear it for Halloween."
5.0,Great costume! I needed for a soire at school and it was amazing. Size chart worked perfect and I was ordering it for one of my models. Quality was excellent you couldn't tell this was a costume... You could use as a real dress as well.
5.0,good quailty
5.0,the halloween costume I was looking for!
5.0,"I LOVE my costume, it is exactly what I wanted; sexy yet elegant and not 'slutty' looking but fun and out of the ordinary for a perfect Halloween celebration.  I follow the other reviewers and bought a size larger than I normally wear (I am 5'2 and 160 lb) because the reviews stated that it run small and kind of thigh on the hips area, and my size X-Large fits fine, maybe a tad loose on the hips, but then again I am not big on the hips/butt area.  It also might be a bit long for some people (it hits right above my knee, nothing like the model on the picture, but I am 5'2) , but I think that for me it is what I should wear. It could be easily shortened if need and I am still debating if I should just do that. I really like my new costume."
5.0,"While it seems only ""slutty and bloody"" options are available for any young ladies, this is a perfect alternative, with a little bit of sass, a lot more class, and a whole lot of fun. The dress is awesome, although you may have to wear a black tank underneath, or perhaps shorten it a smidge in the shoulders, in case it fits a tad too low. I expected the headpiece to only be okay, which it was, so I ordered a separate, Gatsby inspired, head piece on amazon . I also ordered strings of pearls on amazon, T-strap shoes, a black and white feather boa, and a cigarette holder. I purchased fish net stockings locally, which I thought might be too much, but it was just the right touch of a detail detail to make the costume ""complete."" Overall, this is a great foundation piece for a flapper costume. I told my daughter it's one to save for costume parties in years to come."
4.0,"It was delivered quickly and looks just like the picture. I would have given 5 stars but the headband was missing. Also, I would recommend buying a size up because there is absolutely NO ELASTIC in the dress!"
2.0,"Material was not as expected.  Not shapely, just a straight dress. Kind if long if your short like me (5'3)"
4.0,"I have a pear shape and I knew it'd be hard to find this kind of costume (flapper 20's era) that fit me right.  While buying an XL made it barely fit over my hips (still pull it down every so often) the top part of it was loose, as I have an A cup bra size.  I figure with some safety pins, padded bra and some tweaking, I can make this work. Super cute and I love how the tassels move around when I do.  Gorgeous, sturdy costume.  I'm 5'5"" 140lbs."
1.0,Large for me also.  No star rating
4.0,The dress is great it just fit too small.
4.0,"The size chart helps out a lot.... I'm normally a size 7-8 (junior size) and the medium fit me perfect. Length is good too! (I'm 5'2) Just FYI the strings will pull easily, I would recommend you keep in the bag it comes with, also being gentle when putting it on and off."
5.0,I was worried the costume would be either too small or too big. I was pleasantly surprised when it fit perfectly and was well made! It looked really good and I know I will get more use out of it over the years. Really enjoyed wearing it!
5.0,Loved it!!!! It was a huge hit at a Harlem Nights party. Will definitely purchase from this buyer again.
4.0,"It runs a little small.  I normally wear a 8-10, but ordered the Large (10-12). It fit perfect."
5.0,Great quality for the price.
5.0,Before I read other reviews I wanted to buy S size and M is just perfect! I am more than satifsied with the product!
3.0,"The dress I ordered was a small, it was actually a little on the snug side, I am 5ft and 105 pounds and usually when halloween costumes say they are a small they are usually still very big one me, so if you want to order this I would size up ! Also the headband with the feather broke as I took it out of the package hadn't even tried it on my head ! The dress looks okay for one night So for the price I can't be bothered to return it but I think it will last one halloween and that will be it, a halloween I might add that I won't be eating much or sitting down lol !!"
4.0,"I'm 5 ft. tall and it was a little too long for my liking, so I easily cut the last tier and did some pinning on the sides, but other than that, it's great. I had seen in the picture that the headband feather looked pretty pathetic, so I ordered one somewhere else and I'm really glad I did!"
5.0,"Love it, fits perfect and reasonable price."
5.0,Surprisingly cute and well made for a cheap costume. Quite flattering.
3.0,It is a small large...I can wear it but would not be comfortable for an entire evening.  I am returning it for a plus size...which I have not received yet.
3.0,"I really liked the costume and was surprised that it didn't look cheaply made. However, this was definitely too small for me. I ordered the x-large and couldn't even get it all the way on. I have bigger hips and usually wear a size 10 or 12. Would be perfect for someone without larger hips though!"
5.0,"After reading previous reviews before ordering, the comments were right on with size.  I normally wear a size 6(medium), I brought the large(8-10) and it was a perfect fit.  It fits like a glove and very sexy!  A great dress for so many occasions."
4.0,This dress was perfect for what I needed it for.  Many complements.  Fun to dance in.
5.0,"I love this costume with good quality! And the dress came with a nice hairband. As for the size, My size is between S and M, but i ordered M and it's just perfect right! Thanks Amazon!"
4.0,"The dress is cute - it arrived within 24 hours of rush ordering it. However, both the description AND the packaging say it comes with the dress and a headband, but there was no headband.  Sad because I'm wearing it tomorrow night.  Be sure to order accessories if you need them. A bit disappointed."
5.0,I love the dress. I may even wear it at a regular party.
5.0,"This dress saw its fair share of action and held up really well! I wore it for hours at prom and it was both comfortable and well-fitting. The only problem was that it shed some strings every now and then, but other than that it was a fabulous deal! If you're looking for a flapper, I recommend this one."
4.0,"I needed a flapper dress ASAP for an unexpected show I had to perform in, ordered it probably like four days before and got it within two days. Ended up fitting perfectly and won me *Best Costume*. Although if you are planning on getting this, I would recommend either getting or making your own head band because, the measly thing I got with the dress was just a sequinny elastic headband and one tiny bent feather. I made my own headband and it looked top notch."
4.0,"I am a size 6 aus up top and a size 10 aus pants so the dress sits perfectly on top but doesn't sit loose on my butt it actually rides up and sits just under my butt cheeks.
But otherwise I'm happy with it as it fits my dancers who are a size 8 aus perfectly.
I've bought 4 dresses and the quality of material at a small price"
5.0,Beautiful costume purchased for Halloween dance ordered extra large could have ordered a size smaller it should be ok.
5.0,"I love the dress! It arrived quickly! As described before there is little stretch in the hips so order accordingly. I am 5'8"" 125 and the medium was perfect."
5.0,"I absolutely loved the dress, got so many wonderful compliments. Will definitely order from this company again."
5.0,"We got the costume for a talent show and were very late in ordering it.  We did not have special shipping, but ordered Friday evening and it was here on Monday. What a cute costume. You saved the day for us and we thank you."
1.0,"It is to big on the top. This is the third one I have order, the large was to small on the bottom , fit on the top."
1.0,Save your money
5.0,I am very pleased! It was everything I wanted in a flapper dress. Thanks
5.0,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE
5.0,FIT NICE
3.0,"This is a nice dress for a costume.  My only complaint is that the sizing listed online is different than the sizing on the package.  Unfortunately, wayyyy to small."
4.0,"We plan to attend a Roaring 20's event on our next cruise. This will work. The fringe will probably fall off all over the ship, but it's a one-time thing."
2.0,"Pretty dress, but the sizing might be a bit off."
5.0,I'm a size 4 or 6 depending on cut/style of the dress and bought the size Small and fits me perfectly.
3.0,ok
4.0,"Aside from the size being too small, the service received was great!  Very surprised for a first time purchaser."
5.0,"The package came together as expected. Dress,  gloves, fishnet stocking & the boa!"
4.0,had to return for another size.
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered a medium. I usually wear a small in everything (size 2 dress). The top part was too big but the bottom skirt area fit great. Just had to get a minor alteration to the top straps and then it fit great. Glad I didn't order a small, probably wouldn't have fit in the hip area."
4.0,"Make sure to get one size up on this one.  Otherwise, great dress! The quality is excellent for the price."
5.0,"Good quality costume, which I wore to a 20's murder mystery party. As others have noted, some of the fringe will fall off and the fabric underneath isn't particularly nice or opaque. But I think it's great for the price! The size small fit me with a little room to spare (I'm usually a size 2)."
5.0,Fits true to size! Lucky I got a large because the Med would of been too small.! And I ordered on short notice and was kinda scare but it all worked out.
5.0,"I was a little skeptical on the sizes after reading other reviews so I ordered the extra large and it fit perfectly! I had a Great Gatsby birthday party and I knew that the dress was perfect the moment I put it on. It was beautiful and the layers of fringe guarantee a roaring good time! Perfect costume, perfect fit! It made the night all the more better. The only thing I would caution is the sizing. The costume does run small around the hips so make sure to order a larger size to ensure a proper fit."
2.0,"Since there were no advises on the measurements, it is difficult to order the correct size."
4.0,"If looking for an inexpensive but really quite cute Halloween costume, this is a good choice. I'm normally a small and the medium fit me perfectly, so I would say size up, for sure."
4.0,"Looks as expected for a costume.  Don't expect to wear it multiple times though, the fringe falls out easily."
1.0,"CHEAP AND SMALL!! and they didn't let me return it. no, thanks"
5.0,"wow! just received my dress.  it was everything I hoped it would be.  I wear size 8-10  but got x-large because of the reviews, it fits prefect and  I am kinda top heavy(40 c). fridges in front and back, I am 5 feet one it was  not too short or long, I don't have wide hip, and it still look nice, not a costume look  but a real dress look , not cheap looking. got it for a Halloween cruise.  don't forget order a size larger and be prepared too smile!"
5.0,Loved this costume! The fringe goes all the way around. It's not just in the front. Good quality for the price!
1.0,I bought this item for my adult daughter for a party she was to attend.  I had it send directly to her apartment.  I even paid for expedited delivery.  I was delivered on time but it was stolen off her front porch before she could retrieve it!  She lives in a gated community!
4.0,Bought for Youth Participating in a Beauty and Talent Program for the IBPO Elks of the World. The girls loved the look!
4.0,"Perfect fit and as expected.  Looks great and will b great for my event
Diane
Thank you so much....love it"
4.0,"After reading the reviews and realizing that this is probably sized according to asian measurement standards, I found it extremely fortunate to buy two sizes bigger than what I normally wear. Other than that, this thing is rockin'!"
3.0,Looked great but medium was more like a small! It was great for the costume party we attended!  I am at 6-8 and The medium was tight. Just wish it was a little bigger.
5.0,"I bought this dress after - thankfully - reading the reviews.  I saw that several people said that the dresses run very small.  So, even though I typically wear a size 8, (I'm 5'0"" and weigh 129 pounds) I went ahead and ordered a large.
So glad I did! The dress fit like a glove!  Since I'm short, I ended up taking in the top of the shoulder straps just a tad because it hung too low for me, but the dress was beautiful. Great quality! I got lots of compliments as well!  It came with the headband and necklace and looked super cute!  The fringe goes all the way around the dress. Not just in the front. That's one of the main reasons I chose this one.  You'll love it!"
4.0,"I wear between a size 6 to 8, but the medium fits very close. I did not choose the large thinking it would have been to big."
4.0,"I wear a 1 in pants, 0 sometimes, & xs-sm in shirts. I'm 4'8"" & it was a little past my knee. Some strands did fall off but it was exactly what I needed for my holiday party & I was the best dressed. It fit really well. It came in perfect timing!"
5.0,"Ordered a large after reading previous reviews, fit perfectly on super athletic 5' 10' body. Looked great lots of fun for a school project party."
5.0,"This is perfect, fits perfectly. The sizing chart is accurate.
The tassels are great and the dress does actually come with a headband with feather too.
Also arrived on the day that amazon stated :)"
4.0,good quality.
4.0,Very nice quality for a costume but sent back because it was too large.  I am a size 4 but expected a medium to fit because many reviews noted that it ran small.  It arrived super fast and my account was credited immediately upon return.
4.0,I like it. Its somewhat small. This will make me go on a diet for I have 2 months more before I use it.
4.0,The dress fit well and was perfect for my event. It doesn't come with the boa or necklace but the head piece was an added touch.
5.0,"The dress is perfect. Not to long or SHORT. I ordered this for a party that I am planning on attending and it is going to be perfect for the 20's theme. The sizing chart was a little off, so at first I ordered this dress a size smaller than I actually needed, but they sent me a replacement withing just a few days. Great company and great product!"
5.0,"This is perfect for our flapper corporate event, it looks great on and is not too short.
I definitely recommend buying the long gloves to complete the look!"
3.0,"I did not see a size chart listed when ordering, but reading the other reviews, it was clear this flapper dress ran small. I ordered an XL.  When it arrived, I checked the size chart on the package which claimed XL fits size 10-12. I wear a 10-12 off the rack dress so I had hope. However I could not get this dress past my waist. I hadn't realized the chart itself was so skewed. Therefore having access to a size chart would not have helped at all. I probably needed an XXXL
I returned the dress. As for quality I would say nicely made.
I gave it three stars because if it doesn't fit, quality doesn't matter."
4.0,"Bought this for my 15 year old daughter and it was perfect.  We added a boa from Michaels Craft Store and a cheap pearl necklace.  It was the perfect outfit and she will be able to wear it again. Quality wasn't excellent, but it was definitely decent quality and held up great through a night of running around and hanging with friends!"
4.0,"Fits well, just glad I ordered the size larger because does run a little small.  Material and quality is better than I expected."
4.0,The warnings about the dress being a size smaller than stated is true. I got a small and it just barely went over my hips when usually small sizes are a little baggy for me. So keep that in mind. Some tassles fell off here and there but not a ton and it wasn't noticeable. The tassles are pretty cool and swing around a lot which looks nice. I didn't use the headband that came with it since I wanted a nicer one. The headband looked cheap compared to the dress.
4.0,"I ordered this as a last minute outfit to a flappers party. The dress is well constructed and looks the same as in the image provided. In addition to the dress and headband that arrived, I purchased long gloves and feather earrings to match. Very pleased with the quality and the delivery time."
4.0,"I bought this dress for a roaring 20s event and it is very cute and flattering.  It is short though so be prepared to wear a slip and pantyhose underneath.  I found that the sizing was pretty accurate.  I wear a size 6 pant and a size 8 dress and I originally bought the large, but it hung like a rag on me.  I returned it for the medium size and it fit perfectly if not a little loose  around the middle.  Definitely a good purchase for me."
4.0,"My daughter needed this for a sorority event (Lord knows).  She sent me the link to order for her, at least she said please this time,  Before I ordered I read the reviews and noticed many saying the dress was tight through the hips.

I called her and mentioned that to her, and asked that she review her size,  Of course that was an INSULT.

Anyway, when I did not hear back I ordered her original request size.  The pico-second I hit the buy button the phone rang and she said OK, get the bigger size.  Amazon was great about cancelling the first order.

Just got an email yesterday, ""The dress arrived, thank you.  It is HUGE.  I think I can use safety pins to fix it.  I know I should have gotten the smaller size.""  Talk about a poke in the eye, when I bought her the damn dress!

So, it sometimes sucks to be the dad and I am not sure this dress is as small as some think!"
5.0,"this is a great item for the price.  many said it ran small so i ordered up, but i found the sizing to be true to size so i ended up with a dress that was a bit too big for me so i now have to order my actual size.  arrived quickly."
5.0,"This costume is both sexy and adorable, especially for the price. Wore to a Gatsby party and felt like a million bucks. Very flattering and fringe is forgiving. I paired it with a long Egyptian inspired necklace that gave it a classier look than a long strand of costume pearls would have. The included headband is cute too! I'm a size 6, 5'5"" and 130lbs. and I got a large after reading other reviews. It fit exactly as I had hoped!"
5.0,"This one definitely runs small.  I'm a size 10/12 in pants, but usually an 8 in dresses.  I bought the XL size thinking I'd have to take it in, but it fit pretty much perfectly.  I'd recommend ordering up at least one size.  Besides the sizing difference, I would definitely recommend this.  It's a great investment for the price."
5.0,"The picture is pretty accurate for the look of the costume. Unlike many other flapper costumes, the sheath is a stretch fabric, so it hugs the figure instead of looking like a fringed pillowcase. The feather headband that comes with it felt cheap, so I tossed it, but overall the costume is a great value."
4.0,Needed a dress for a casino night.  It fit very well and looked great.  The only concern - some of the fringe came off.  Not a major problem.
1.0,"I read the reviews before ordering this item. With many people saying it ran small, I ordered an XL (I wear size 12)..
I tried it on when it arrived and couldn't even get my arms & head into it, it was so snug! Forget ordering this garment and order the other flapper costume ... so much better!"
5.0,Great dress for the price.  I opened the package and was surprised as to the quality of the dress.  Wore it to a roaring 20's party and will wear it again!
5.0,"The quality of the costume is better than expected, my height is 1.56m and i bought large because of the reviews, the fit was perfect, just a bit too long.

Recommended!!"
5.0,"I wanted a 1920's theme Bachelorette party and I searched for flapper dresses for a while and I decided on this one. I am so pleased with the dress! I was worried because a lot of the flapper dresses I looked at everyone said fit too small. I decided to go with one size up. I am usually a large and I am 5' 7"", I ordered the xl and it fit me perfectly. It was the perfect length, and it didn't restrict me at all. Some pieces of the fringe fell off here and there but that is to be expected. We went to all kinds of different places to dance and by the end of the night the dress still held up very well. I would HIGHLY recommend this dress and for the price it perfect."
5.0,This flapper costume worked perfectly for the 20s party I attended.  I was worried about sizing so order 2 sizes.  I consistently wear a size 6 and got the medium and large. The medium fit but was pretty tight. The large fit perfectly and I was very comfortable.  The headband was a great addition!  I ordered some cheap costume pearls and my costume was complete!
4.0,The product was nice & comfortable.  It fit nicely as well.  Shipped fairly quickly also.  Some of the strings were falling out during the wear duration though.
2.0,"Delivery was timely, however the costume was very small in the hip area and bigger up top. Some of the fringes were coming apart, however it wouldnt be a bad outfit for a one night party. Unfortunately I had to return it due to the size."
2.0,this dress came mangled. the string was falling apart. by the end of the night there were loose strings everywhere
5.0,It was perfect for what I needed. I'm a size 6 in most clothing & ordered a large. It was not tight but fitted.  Glad I read the reviews and ordered a size up. A large is probably a perfect size 8.  Well made in the sense it was not shedding fringe like some other people's costumes. Good price. Fast shipping. It will last through a few wearings at least.  The headband is simple but gets the job done.
5.0,"good quality, and fit was what I expected. Order a size up. Will keep for future use. love the fringe"
5.0,"I purchased this costume for a Great Gatsby Murder Mystery party.  It was made well, light weight with good stitching with stretch material."
3.0,size chart is a little off.  ordered large because it stated it was for sizes 10-12 when in reality it is more like 8-10.
5.0,"I'm quite slender and tall, and this costume was perfect for my build! I'm used to most things being too big on me, but this worked great. This product does run very small though. The small was listed as a 6-8, and I'm a size 0 and, again, it fit my hips perfectly."
5.0,"Outfit is really cute. It fit me perfect but a little big in the breast area. I am 5'5-6 & 115lbs.  It's a ""Costume"" so don't expect it to be the finest of quality but worked out great for a 20's Hollywood Glamour Party.  Lot's of women complained it ran small but I felt it fit like any other size small, although it did indicate the size small was a 6 & I would size it as a small 0-2.  Hope this is helpful :-)"
3.0,"fits little tight, quality is not the best, a lot of loosed ends, if buying for a single use its ok, i don't think it can stand a single wash."
5.0,"Ordered it yesterday at 3pm and now it's 12:30pm and it's here.
It fits perfectly...I got an XL but I'm usually a medium.
I'm 5ft 6  and weigh 145 lbs."
4.0,It does run small. BUT ordered 2 sizes up and it was a hit.  Ordered in black. Very classy looking.
5.0,"Loved this dress for our Prohibition party. Got a lot of compliments on how cute it was. It is of costume-quality so by the end of the night the red fringe were falling out, but I would highly recommend this for a costume party."
4.0,I wear a size 8 and normally a medium. I bought the x-large in this costume and it fit perfect. Very cute costume! The only reason I give it 3 rather then 4 stars is because the size was so odd.
5.0,"Got this for my Dads 90th birthday ""roaring 20's party"" and it was a hit. Nicely made. great if you need a fun dress"
4.0,It was a little small fitting for the size.  Reasonable quality for the price and look for a costume party
2.0,"I bought a large, I usually wear a medium. It fit light a small. Little disappointed in the size since I wanted it to hang off my body, not fit with any type of snug. It was just the opposite.  Fortunately this was a fun party where sexy was OK! I don't even think XXXL would have hung like I wanted it to!"
3.0,The reviews I had read prior to purchase said if you normally wear a medium get the xl. So I did. The top of the dress was huge so I had to pin the dress in. The bottom of the dress was really tight (I can see why they said get a larger size than you normally wear). I'm normally am 8 in pants but I do have curves and even the xl was tight around my hips. Over all the dress is made to hide the bad and it worked for the party I was at. At the end of the day I can say I was satisfied.
5.0,I love it! only problem is the fringe comes off pretty easily but if you are only going to wear it a few times its great!
4.0,"Snug but doable in x large. Good quality some loose strings. I am 6 foot and 245  so it was as I said snug,but the feathered headband was nice,included. Right out of ""Some like it hot"" Lots of comments ,mostly good.."
3.0,"For the price this was ok.  The fringe is not very thick, rather spread out on the dress.  The size was too small for me even though an xl usually fits and I have room."
5.0,"I usually wear size Large..I'm 5'9 150lb. I got XL and it fits perfect, super cute..I love it. The strings do come loose but I'm only wearing it once.  The price was right and delivery was quick"
5.0,"I ordered this costume for a 20s murder mystery party coming up.  It is very cute, just as pictured.  I wanted to write this review because, as others have  mentioned, the costume is small.  I am 5'1"" 105 lbs and normally wear a 0-2, XSP.  I ordered the small and while it fits comfortably (not tight at all), it is not loose on me at all as a regular small normally would be.  Also, it is fairly short considering my height.  I thought this information might help those who are trying to determine what size to buy.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,I bought this dress for a costume party over the holidays. I had read the reviews prior to buying it and it was mentioned many times that it ran a little small. I usually wear a size large or size 12. I ordered the extra large and it fit perfect. It was not too tight and very comfortable. I got lots of compliments on the dress. The fringe does seem to shed a bit but did not affect the look of the dress. Most of the other flapper dresses at the party had the same problem or the feathers were coming off. Easy to move around in and dance in as well. Arm holes were not too big or too tight which was great. Arrived earlier than the estimated ship date too so that was even better.
5.0,I got this for a 1920's part that we had and it was a hit.  I got the dress and all the accessories and everyone loved my get up.  this was a great buy.
5.0,"The only suggestion is when you ordering be careful with sizes, choose two size bigger than what you are. However, Im so HAPPY with choice and with delivery process."
2.0,"This nice dress runs small, this was for my 16 daughter for using it in Halloween, so disappointed the size that we gotta run to get another custom"
5.0,"Great fit, bit tight, recommend getting one size bigger that  normal, I did. Good quality fabric, looks very nice. !"
5.0,"I originally ordered an L, but it was a bit too snug. I normally wear dress size 8/10, and the XL fit great. Great price for a fun flapper night out."
4.0,"I bought this for a great gatsby themed holiday party. Worked out great! Pretty much bought all of the accessories shown in the picture as well but from different vendors(all are sold separately). It really was the best costume designed for the 1920's that I had seen and I got a lot of compliments on it!

I did read previous comments before purchasing and read that it runs a little small in the hips. I bought one size up from my current size, and it seemed to fit perfectly. Glad I listened to them!"
1.0,I ordered a size small but was sent a XLarge. Got run around when I went to return it. Buyer watch out.
5.0,Dress could easily be worn out on the town.  This dress is more than a costume.  The design is relevant today.
4.0,I weigh in at 120 pounds and the XL size just fit.  The product was OK but runs really small.
2.0,"My boyfriend purchased this for me on his prime account, which is why my review isn't an ""Amazon Verified Purchase"". I am 5'2"", 110lbs, 34a, and bought the Small. The dress is fit comfortably at the hips and chest for me but was very loose at the waist. I actually probalby would've prefered an XS if it was an option. The dress probably seems tighter than it actually is because there's no zipper, so you have to wrestle the dress over yourself. Since the dress was cheap,  I ended up getting it altered to have the waist taken in, and it looked great after that.

However, after having it altered and then wearing it once to a party, most of the threads on the dress started to fray and come apart. To me, this was definitely just a one-time use dress. I wouldn't wear it again."
1.0,"I know other reviewers said that this runs small and to get a size bigger.
I got it just in case it looked good and more the part for the Great Gatsby themed party I went to than my own velveteen long black dress. Glad I had my own dress to wear.  This dress was so tight even my slim, teenage daughter had a hard time fitting into it. And that was the extra-large size.
I bought it thinking that if it was a little too small it would be fine for the children's dressing up box. So will wait till my youngest hits  about age 9 and then she should fit into it! No joke.
However, the Gatsby Rhinestone & Feather Fascinator Cocktail headband was a great hit for the party. I also ordered that through Amazon."
2.0,"Similar to other reviews, costume came quickly; I was hosting a speakeasy holiday party and didn't need to spend a lot of $$, so a costume fit the bill. I expected and got costume quality, which was cheap, but better than spending $200 on a vintage dress I might not wear again! I ordered a large; I normally wear a size 10-12, which can run from medium to large, so I thought I was playing it safe but this dress was so tight in the hips that I could barely get it on. My husband had to help me get into it and because the hips were so tight in the dress, the costume ended up being ridiculously short, so that I had to wear bike shorts underneath to keep it from being obscene! I'm pretty sure flappers were known for loose-fitting clothing, not tight, constrictive clothing. I'm also pretty sure the modern woman could probably not fit into a real 1920s dress, so the size definitely needs to be adjusted. I would not order from California costumes again because of this."
1.0,dress could not have been new-sticky on the seal was not sticky and the fringe on the neckline was hanging completely off-only had 1 night to find my daughter a new roaring 20's dress for homecoming. Waste of money!!!!
5.0,"Thank goodness I read the other reviews, it does run small.  I normally wear a Medium but ordered an XL.  It fits perfect & I love the  dress."
4.0,"Good quality for how inexpensive it is. However, I ditched the cheap looking headpiece. Note that if you're tall like me (6ft) it will be a mini skirt!"
5.0,"I purchased this for a last minute costume (grey scale silent film star). Firstly, I read all the reviews and ordered the small assuming it would fit me b/c the majority of reviews state that it runs small or even extremely small. This is very relative. This is definitely not a junior's small, and arguably a women's small. It was too big on me and frankly, I felt really silly on Halloween but had no time to take it in since I received it that day and had my kid's costuming to contend with as well. Here's my size info in case it helps:

5'5""
103 lbs
32 B

As for the quality, it's pretty good for a bagged costume. You're definitely gonna lose a few strands of the fringe but the slink and drape are good and the under-construction is plenty sturdy for the weight of the fringe. It's not going in your washing machine, but it's a much better look, feel, and quality than the average costume in this price-range. I give it 5 stars, the misunderstanding on size was my fault, not the costume's."
1.0,Returned this item because it fit EXTREMELY SMALL. I ordered a large expecting it to be a bit roomy (I normally would've ordered a medium) but I couldn't even get it over my shoulders!
3.0,Bought it for a Great Gatsby theme party. The material is very cheap but you can't really expect much else from a costume it's not a designer dress.
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress! I was so happy and pleasantly surprised when I opened the package to see this kind of detail. I was amazed of the weight and designer quality. The details in this dress can't be captured by a camera. The tassels are perfectly placed, the satin material is a nice stock and the sequin details are a beautiful touch! Then I tried it on and wow it fit me as if it were tailored for me! It gave me hugged every curve that I didn't know I had and it made me feel so amazing and so sexy! I know my smile must have been from ear to ear at the party that night I got so many compliments, I really felt like a movie star! I will wear this dress to cocktail parties and out to dinner and can't wait to wear it again. I have designer dresses that cost 5 times what this did that don't have the style and quality this does. I'm ordering the red one now!"
3.0,"The sizing runs small. It should not be labeled XL.
I wear a size 14 and this was too tight and caused the
dress to ride up.  Defeated the purpose of it being a
flapper costume."
5.0,I had to order a larger size than what I normally wear and it's still a bit tight. Really well made for the price and for a costume. I plan to wear it for costume parties for years and maybe even to cocktail parties. I got a lot of compliments on it. I went to a Roaring Twenties party and it was the nicest of all the flapper costumes like it.
4.0,"I spent a lot of time reviewing this product before buying it. I was somewhat worried that it wouldn't fit right since many people had mentioned it, but it actually wasn't too bad.

I am 5'5 and around 155 pounds. I ordered a large and it fit pretty well. It was a bit tight around my hips, but nothing too bad. I thought it was super cute, but the strings did come off really easily. I didn't lose a large amount that evening I wore it, but I found a few on the ground and just laughed.

Overall for the price that I paid, it was a great buy and it was super cute. Worth the purchase."
5.0,"I bought this for Halloween and it arrived just in time!  I'm glad I read the reviews and went a size up (I'm a usually a medium, but got a large) and it fit perfect!  Some of the fringe came off, but the dress looked fine.  It was really fun and comfortable to dance in!  The headband is a plus and fit great too."
4.0,Fits just fine and quite frankly I look good in it and would like to where it to more than just a costume party.
3.0,"Followed advice from the other reviews to size up, and ended up ordering an XL because the L was out of stock. Wow, thank goodness I did! I usually wear a size 8 dress but the fit in this was WAY off. The dress was snug over my hips and would have been tolerable for a costume party (if I didn't plan on sitting or busting out my best dance moves), but the top of the dress was absolutely too big. I was impressed with the quality of the dress (best I've seen for a relatively inexpensive Halloween costume) but ended up returning it because of the fit."
5.0,Beautiful costume I received so many compliments. Fits true to Size and a great price. This is something I will definitely wear again another year.
3.0,I read the reviews and order what size that was recommended and it was way too large and I couldn't wear it any way.
5.0,"Glad I read the reviews about buying a size larger.  What a cute dress! Very satisfied! Received lots of compliments at a 20's Party. Shipping was fast, I received the dress 1 week after ordering."
4.0,Fit very well.  Not uncomfortably short.  Runs a just a little smaller than sizing chart indicates.  Cute and worked for a murder mystery party
3.0,Very small for the sizing.  I wear a 12 or 14 with a 38d bust.  I can put it on but look like a sausage that tried to bind my chest.  I returned it since I couldn't move in it.  I would recommend buying a size larger than you expect even based on their size charts
5.0,"This costume is absolutely awesome !!!
The small size has the perfect fit for me (5'3 115lb)
Add a boa, opera gloves and nice heel shoes, you will look amazing !"
4.0,Great costume especially for the price and better quality than I expected and fun to wear. Not much else to say.
5.0,the quality is very good and I definatly recommend it. I was very happy with my purchase. Very well made I love it so much
4.0,"The size large is similar to a ladies 6, and fit my teen daughter very nicely.  She likes the fit (me too) and she's excited for Halloween. I only withheld the 5th star on account of a few fringy pieces already unraveling , which makes them a bit noticeable since they look fluffier than normal.  I easily took care of them with some scissors!"
4.0,"After reading the reviews I was hesitant to size up, but it was definitely the right choice! I'm 5'2"" and 120lbs, normally wearing a small, and the medium fit me perfectly. Even the sizing chart on the costume packaging is wrong! Like other reviewers I found it's tight through the hips - I have a 36"" hip and the dress is comfortable but definitely snug on me.

The dress itself is exactly what I expected, not the highest quality but perfectly useful. Maybe a little low-cut but that's OK. Would recommend if you're looking for a quick, cheap flapper costume."
5.0,Very cute dress and does indeed run very small! I ordered a large and it is very flattering!! I usually wear a 4/6 in dresses. I'm glad I listened to the reviews!
4.0,The material is better than expected for a costume so it's actually wearable for another occasion. Size wise after reading the other reviews I still went with a medium like I always do. I'm 24 and I'm 5.4 and 125 pounds and it fit perfectly. fit snug around the hips and the top part was a little loose but I wouldn't want it any tighter. all in all I'm glad for the purchase.
5.0,"well put together costume, was suprised of its weight.. i love it! if you are big busted go up a size though"
4.0,"I read the other reviews and so went a size up. They have a weight chart listed on the packaging, which I think would make a lot more sense to show than the sizing, which is clearly wrong."
4.0,"The flapper costume is really cute! The size runs small which I gathered viewing it on the website. Am glad I bought 2 sizes larger.  The fit is still a bit tight. The fringe was hard to control and I needed help to get it to lay straight on the shoulders and back. After wearing it for a few minutes, the fringe finally hung correctly. Got lots of complements and would recommend this purchase for others."
3.0,"The quality of this dress is ok...nothing to be excited about, but then again so was the price.  However, be a bit careful when ordering this dress because it runs a bit small.  I am a 6-8 size in jeans and am normally a 6 in dresses.  so I figured I would order this size just to be safe.  To my surprise, the dress was very snug on my, so much I was afraid to bend over because I thought it might rip."
5.0,"I listened to other reviewers and ordered TWO SIZES UP.  So glad because its a perfect fit! Im a true size 8 dress and ordered the XL.  It really has no give and I have hips.  Its good costume quality, may need to wear a slip under as it seems a little sheer but thats fun to.... cant wait to wear"
3.0,I'm in between a size 11/12 and I ordered a size up (XL). It was too large. Had to return it.
3.0,"I had ordered a large in a different costume and it was very big.  So, I order this in the medium.  I almost couldn't get it off once I put it over my head.  So, I had to order another one, and pay 2 day shipping to ensure I got the replacement in time for the pary."
5.0,"I was looking for a flapper dress for halloween, all others were $35 and up !!!! got this in the mail like 2 days after i ordered it, looks fantastic !!!!!  the straps are a TINY bit big but fixable and a little tight around the hips/thighs (I have big thighs, pear/hourglass body shape so I got a medium) definitely get a size up. I TOTALLY love it."
4.0,I am a size 16 but I ordered the 18. It fit well except for the arms which is a little big  but I will use a tanktop under it...The feather on the headband is very small. The quality is very good..I love this costume...
5.0,"Cute dress... it does run small though! I am 5'7"" and 130lbs. Usually wear a Small in a dress and size 2-4 in pants. I ordered a Medium (due to warnings that it was small) and it fits pretty well. I have bigger hips, so its snug there, but otherwise it's great!"
5.0,"The flapper dress was perfect and adorable. I purchased it for my 18yr old daughter who is about 5'2"" 112lbs. She told me to order a small, but I told her that the reviews say the dress runs small. She insisted the small; and she was right. The small worked out perfect and flattering. Not to revealing and very cute with accessories she bought. Thanks"
4.0,I am very impressed with the quality for the price. Ordered an x-large be because they said it ran small. I wear a 10. Fits pretty good
3.0,"Be aware that this is NOT a x-large, but sized for 8-10.  Quality was great, too bad about the sizing and the length."
4.0,Fits small as many people posted. Other than that it is a great costume. The fringe does tend to come off.
5.0,"very pleased with product, would order again, even a very easy retun for a different size. came on time as promised"
4.0,"It's a great costume, but it really runs small, i usually wear small/medium but looking at the other reviews i ordered a  large, it fit  fine. The fabric is a little see through but in overall it's gorgeous!"
4.0,this model's smile is making me S%#* bricks it is very creepy and is making me not want to buy it!
5.0,I love this dress!  It's so much fun!  The quality is excellent .  It's a perfect fit.  As always Amazon carries the best merchandise !!
3.0,I was happy that the dress came to my house right away. I had read the other reviews and was aware it runs a little small but I was not prepared to have it be two sizes too small. Thankfully I have enough time to get myself into the dress.
1.0,"I recently ordered this costume and deliberately ordered a size larger, just in case. When I received this item I couldn't even begin to put my arms through. I believe the size I received was for a child not an adult."
3.0,"It's Chinese costume cheap - and I had to order 2 sizes bigger than usual for it to fit, but I think it will last through at least one party."
5.0,I love it!  Super cute and does not look cheap!  The fit is really good.  I would definitely recommend this.
3.0,"I got my dress quickly, and was very happy with the quality of the product, but was disappointed when I couldn't even get it on over my head. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews and ordered a size or two up. I am now trying to return it for a larger size."
5.0,Very nice! I am very happy with the quality and delivery time. I ordered size M and I weigh about 110 lbs . Perfect
4.0,"I ordered this costume a week before the theme party. It came just in time. I ordered a size large because of  the reviews. I can see where the costume does run small in the hip area. However, the bust and waist portion was baggy. I pulled the dress up to shorten the length. The costume was a hit. I would definitely order from this company again."
3.0,"It's too tight through the butt.  Of course the fringe hides the tightness so it looks ok in the mirror, but it's just not comfortable with no give to the fabric; I'm afraid it might ride up.  I took it right off; didn't even try to sit in it.  I'm returning it.  I'm 5'4"" and 111lbs and wear 0-2 pants & XS shirts.  I bought the small (which they claim is a 6-8).  I knew it was a risk based on the reviews so I also ordered the one made by Forum Novelties in XS/S -- that one fits perfectly.  They both seem identical in look and quality -- the only differences are that this one from CA Costumes is sized too tightly at the bottom, and the neckline of this one is black, whereas the other one is shiny gold.  I actually like the plainness of the black better, but I'll take the gold if it means I'll be more comfortable and confident rockin' a sexy outfit on Halloween!"
4.0,I would love to give this item a 5 start rating..if the material had some stretch to it it would of been awesome..its a tight fit but good if i don't gain a pound from now to Halloween. Its cute fun n sassy n would def buy from this seller again..I bought a small I weigh 120 lbs n usually wear a size 1 or a 3 depending on the clothes..like i stated before a stretch material would of been awesome
2.0,"The sizing is incorrect. It says it is a 6-8. I typically wear either a large 6 or a small 8. I cannot pull it over my head, much less pull it down on my body."
2.0,I own a black one of these in small and it fits great. I ordered a medium of the red version and it was too small.  Luckily it was easy to return.
4.0,"This is a very cute product but the sizing next to the names of sizes are incorrect. I am a size 0-2 with size 32D breasts and a big butt and the size small (6-8) fits me tightly. I would recommend going up 4 sizes number-wise with the sizes. If you are usually a small but it is tight, you might want to go up a size. And this is for other sizes as well. The outfit is cute and has a soft fabric and the headband is great! I can't wait to wear this dress!
This item is good for the price, remember you are probably going to wear it for one day and never again."
3.0,"I wonder why they don't make these in jersey instead so you get a little stretch.  I would normally get a medium and based on the reviews I got a large.  I still couldn't get it past my hips.  This one is going back.

I will say it arrived quickly, is really cute, and the headband is adorable!  Just order up maybe two sizes..."
1.0,The dress was poorly made from cheap material and not true to size.  I wear a size 10 and I could not get the dress pass my shoulders.  I am returning and purchasing a dress from Party City.
1.0,You can't fit a round peg in a square hole! Why would they just assume a large would work. Costumes generally run small anyway.
5.0,Very nice for the price. I recommend it to anyone looking to buy an outfit suitable for a costume party.
4.0,"This flapper dress is well made for a costume. I bought one for myself and then bought 5 more for the seniors in my dance class for a senior center party. Although we took measurements and checked the measurements against the size chart, I had to return 3 costumes and swap one costume. The dance teacher who usually wears a medium swapped her dress for an x-l. Two women who normally wear large had to exchange their dresses for x-l. One woman who wears an x-l exchanged her dress for a 2x. Only one large dress fit. I would suggest that you order a size or two larger than you normally wear.
We probably can get many years of wear out of this costume."
5.0,"Glad I listened to the other reviews and ordered a size up. I'm 5'8 and the dress hit just above my knee, which is perfect for me. Perfect for the price."
4.0,"I ordered this dress a size up (XL) when I normally wear a 10/12 and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'5 and 36D so if you're about that size DO NOT order the LARGE. It WILL NOT fit you, unless you have no hips/butt/tummy.

I was immediately impressed with the quality of this costume; I had previously tried on similar flapper dresses at the Halloween store in town for twice the price and this one has some weight to it, I can see it lasting many years! It also looks fantastic once you start dancing, the fringe is so cool!

Definitely worth the price."
5.0,I love the costume ! it was not sized properly. They were cut REALLY small. The sizing chart was not accurate
4.0,"I purchased this to wear to a friend's 20's murder-mystery party. Because I wear a size 8/10 in most brands, I purchased the size large (which was advertised for sizes 8-12). When the size large arrived, it was way too small/short/tight. I returned it and got the x-large, which was advertised for sizes 12-14 but fit my 8-10 frame perfectly. I'd recommend ordering a size larger than the one you think you might need."
1.0,The item was overpriced for the quality. The seller has questioned my honesty and made it difficult to return the item. The item is substandard. The seller has made accusations against me. I just want to return the UNUSED item.
5.0,"Good quality item for a really great price! I thought it would be a little flimsy because it was inexpensive and since I'm only wearing it once it didn't matter, but It is made very well and the fabric seems very sturdy."
5.0,I bought this dress for my daughter's fashion show at her elementary school. I did have to pin it up in the arms but it worked out perfectly! The price was perfect and the shipping was fast!!! Very happy with the purchase and the dress wasn't cheaply made like some I have seen. Great purchase!
4.0,"Got this to wear to the Great Gatsby Premiere and it was perfect. It fits VERY snugly though, so if you're teetering on the edge of two different sizes go for the larger size."
5.0,This is a great dress for the price. It does run small so order a size up. I am a size four and the medium was very snug just the way I wanted it to be. I paired it with long pearls and a black and pink boa.
4.0,"It was exactly as I expected. The quality isn't great, but what else would you expect for just $20? Probably would only wear it a few times before it would have to be thrown out."
5.0,The dress is as advertised and looks very authentic. It is great for any themed dance or costume party. Would recommend product to anyone.
4.0,"First of all remember, this is a costume.  It's not meant to be a high quality piece of your wardrobe.  As a costume, I think it's fantastic!  It does run really small through the hips.  I'm 5'-9"" and usually wear a 6 in jeans.  I took the advice of other reviewer and ordered up (Large).  The fit was perfect through the hips.  It was a little loose in the top, but looked fine.  I received a ton of compliments on this dress at a recent 20s themed murder mystery party.  This dress is also longer than most of the other flapper costumes out there.  It was only 3-4 inches above my knees and I felt well covered.  I gave it 4 stars because I did notice that the fringe isn't sewn in well and I kept losing little strings.  It wasn't too bad, but worthy of knocking off a star."
4.0,"For the price, this was very good. I used it for an event and also plan on wearing it again for Halloween. I am a size 4 and purchased a large after reading other reviews. I am very glad that I did! It runs small."
3.0,"The size runs small than actual size. Especially on the bottom of the dress, and it's really short. The quality is ok since it's just a costume. The shipping is on time.."
3.0,I ordered this for a roaring twenties party and am normally a size 14.  I ordered the extra large and could barely get it over my head.  THIS RUNS VERY SMALL.  I will be returning it due to the size issue...but I LOVED the dress and it seemed to be well made.
5.0,"I ordered this costume for my daughter, who was attending a 20's-themed wedding. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was made and the weight of the material it was made with. It was well worth the reasonable price I paid!"
4.0,"Ordered this for a 1920s party I am having. The quality is good for the price, I did lose a few of the fringe pieces but overall not bad. Only complaint is the sizing (seems to happen a lot with costumes). I consistently wear a dress size 4-6 - I'm 5'7"" and 130 pounds. I ordered the large (supposedly a 8-10 on the package) and it fit great. It was a little roomy in the middle but fit fine in the hips and bust - I didn't want it tight. A medium would probably have been snug in places and a small would have been impossible. Definitely go two sizes up!"
5.0,"I ordered this costume for a Roaring 20's party and it really was perfect!  But be careful when ordering because the dress runs small.  I normally wear a size 4 and would have ordered a small, but after reading in the reviews that the dress runs small, I ended up ordering a medium.  Good thing I did!  The medium was very snug and I could barely get into it, but once I got it on it was comfortable and looked great!!!"
2.0,"This dress runs small. I am a 6 and I ordered the small which was to fit sizes 5-7 however it fit like a 4 slightly too small. make sure you get 1 size bigger because they will not exchange this product you will have to send back, and reorder another size."
5.0,We had a 20's theme holiday party and this was perfect for the event.  Fit great and the fringe covered well.
4.0,"And shipped directly to her. She wasn't as impressed as I thought she'd be; but that may just be her personal taste (for a Halloween thing)... I saw visuals; I myself liked it on her, seemed to be good quality."
4.0,"Costume is super cute, I feel it runs a little small, the medium was practically painted on and was very short, but it still worked for our 20s themed new year's party."
3.0,"I am a solid medium in everything I wear, but I had to return the medium and exchange it for a large.  Even the large was tighter on the bottom than I would have preferred.  The bottom portion where the fringe is sewn on doesn't stretch at all, so getting it over your thighs and hips is snug.  It's made of ""costume"" material so don't expect anything fancy, but it certainly does the trick for a costume party for $20.  Just in case you didn't read the description it only comes with the dress and the headband, I ordered a boa and gloves separately (from Hong Kong for cheap) but they still haven't arrived a month later...but that's what I get for being cheap!"
3.0,"This is a cute and fun dress but like a lot of the other reviews have noted it's sized for a stick person. I wear a 10-12 but opted for the XL after reading the reviews. The XL just barely fits and I'm not sure if I am going to wear it yet. If you have any curves, go a size (maybe even two) up."
5.0,"This costume was a life saver because of a) how sexy it was b) how budget conscious it was compared to all those nearly $100 costumed out there now a days c) the good quality. I was really excited to dress up this flapper dress with some fishnets, a boa, cigarette extension, and gloves. For the price it is a really nice costume that got a lot of attention because it looked nice and it's just an easy costume to buy accessories for with very little money. I really liked the touch that the little headpiece added. It is true that the dress fits tight around the legs, I have to admit I deffinitely did a shimmy dance getting into a small but in my case I wanted to go for a sexy flapper look and decided to go with the small not medium. So if you are not trying to do that and want it to fit comfortably i would recommend getting a size larger. I'm going to keep this costume for later use and to lend to friends!"
2.0,"It did not fit.  It was much smaller than measurements stated.  I had to return it.  would have liked it if it had fit correctly.  Fabric stretched, but fringe trim did not!"
4.0,"I really liked this costume - Like others I'm glad I read reviews because it was definitely sized small.  I usually wear a small, ordered a medium and it fit great.  The only things keeping it from a 5 star are the sizing issue and also the fringe seems to come off fairly easily.  Not so much that I can't wear it again, but I definitely left a trail..."
5.0,"I got a lot of compliments on my Flapper dress on Halloween. I read the reviews, and ordered one size larger than my normal size. It doesnt come with a headband, or fishnet, ot girdle. I totally reccommend it, great price on Amazon."
4.0,"Costume was great, I went with other suggestions and ordered a size up. I ordered a Medium and it was snug but fit perfect. I am 5'9'' and wear a size small top and 28 (4 or 6) pants. Headband was a little snug but made the costume!"
2.0,"Costume looked good when I got it out of the package.
The material is 100% synthetic and a bit see through, and it sheds (the tassels). But I wasn't expecting much from a $20 costume.
I would have kept it but the size is way off. I ordered the x-large, which is supposed to be size 14 - it's not!
I'm a size 14 and I could barely fit into it- let alone wear it. Also since the material is 100% synthetic, it has no elasticity at all, so even if it was my size - it's a hassle to put on/ take off.
I had to return it :("
3.0,"This dress is sized very small. I am usually a medium and ordered a medium but it is extremely tight fitting.  Also, cheaply made. I put it on for the first time and about 5 of the fringe fell off. Definitely a one time use sort of dress."
1.0,Sizes were incredibly inaccurate and the material felt as if it would tear on the first washing. I just expected a little better quality.
4.0,The dress was purchased for a fancy dress/ costume party.  It was thinner than expected but good price for a one time use item.
5.0,"this dress makes you want to dance and shimmy! It is so much fun. As some other reviewers said, it is tight around the hips and butt, so keep that in mind when ordering. It is such a flattering dress you'll want to wear it for more than just Halloween!"
2.0,"Runs small, runs tight, is extremely short.  Definitely a halloween costume.  I made it work with black spanx-- otherwise it would have been totally indecent.  Its very flattering because of the fringe placement, so even though i felt like I was wearing lingerie, i got LOTS of compliments."
3.0,"dress was made with no shape, so it was really tight at the bottom and too loose on top for me..."
4.0,"Very cute costume, I was pretty satisfied with the quality of it for the price you pay. Although I expected the costume to be a little more stretchy so I would say it runs a little small. Over all great costume!"
5.0,Dress was adorable and the quality was decent for the price. Fit was tight in the thigh area. I'm a size four and the small was snug. Worked fine though.
4.0,"I bought the for a Roaring Twenties dinner party. I am a size 8-10 and 5' 7""and read the reviews that it ran ""small"". Yes it does. I ordered a large. It fits very snug over the hips, and almost and fine in the bust area. The manufacturer should modify their sizing. I think a xl would have been a better fit in the hips but gape in the bust. But for the price I can make do for one night and maybe a future Halloween party. The quality was better than I expected, although the feather and headband was a little sad. I went and bought a larger feather to add."
4.0,"This was shipped super fast, thanks to Amazon Prime. I may never buy a costume in the store again, this was a great buy for the low price. It was almost $60 in the Halloween stores here!

The quality is nice. I got the black. Its not sheer, which I was afraid of, so no slip needed! All of the tassles are attached. I may go buy a new headpiece, this one is a little dinky...but for $20, whatever.

BEWARE OF THE SIZING! I am 5'7"", 135/140 lbs. I ordered a Large after reading reviews and the large fits me almost perfect in the hips because I have larger hips. But the waist, bust and shoulders are a little too loose. I should have ordered a Medium"
2.0,"I ordered a small and had to send it back. I wear a 2/4 and I couldn't get it over my shoulders. I replaced it with a medium, but it is still incredibly tight and has no give in the fabric."
4.0,"First and foremost, this product runs about 2 sizes small. I wear a ladies 4/6 (usually a size small), and this dress was EXTREMELY tight in a medium. Surprisingly, the top fit fine (I usually struggle up top because my girls are big for my frame). It was very tight through the butt/thighs. Wearable, but at risk of tearing the dress in public, so I slit the dress up the sides and wore a skirt under it, which worked fine for me since I was on a deadline and didn't have time to order a large.

For the price, this costume is actually great. All the seems didn't line up perfectly, and it did shed some of it's fringe, but I don't think I could've done better for the money, and I know it would have cost me more to make something. The costume was a hit at the party, and I could wear it again if I had another reason to."
3.0,"The pricing is right for the quality. The fringe falls out & stretches. The size chart may not be accurate, little too small for me, but I made it work. I would not order it again, but it did serve its purpose & I threw it away after my event."
4.0,"I ordered this for a costume party it arrived on time and when I tried it on, it was a great fit..the size described rang true, which was a problem with other costumes from different retailers. Thanks California Costumes I had a great time and everyone loved my costume.

DM Hall"
3.0,"The dress itself is decent, especially for the price. If it had fit I definitely would have been very pleased. Unfortunately the sizing is ridiculously off. I normally wear a 4-6 and ordered the Medium (8-10) since most reviews warned that it runs small. I figured even if it were loose that'd be fine bc that kind of goes with the flapper style anyway. I could barely get it past my chest and the hips were not gonna happen. Honestly, I'm not that curvy so this was a shock. Sadly, I had to return. I wish they had more accurate sizing bc now I'm too hesitant to buy any of the California Costumes items."
4.0,"This dress was really comfortable,but definitely good advice on ordering the next size up!!! I wish it had more pictures of it on the site, but the dress itself is very nice."
4.0,"I like the feel of this dress! Feels like something you can wear on a regular basis- OK not on a REGULAR basis but it feels like an actual piece of clothing as oppose to most of the other costumes, thin, cheap, and wear only once!

I like the headband with feather that it came with. Fits with the costume theme. For the price and quality, it's not so bad. I'd definitely recommend this costume to many friends so we can go as a flock of flapper girls to Halloween parties this year!!

You can dress up the dress with a feather boa and gloves that you'd have to buy separately, which I prefer more over an entire costume that has the gloves and boa... I'd prefer to buy it separately. Most of the time, it's cheaper that way. And you can reuse the gloves with another outfit."
5.0,"This dress is perfect!
I bought it as a quick solution for a Halloween costume. I read other peoples reviews and ordered a size up from what I was. So glad I did because it fits perfectly. If I had gone with a medium it wouldn't have been good for my hips. I'm a 8 and I ordered a L and it fits like a glove.
Dresses quality is great for a costume. A good purchase in my opinion, can't wait for Halloween to wear it!"
3.0,"If buying this strictly for an inexpensive costume option, then this dress is worth it.  The sizing runs a bit small (as other reviewers mentioned) so order up a size (or two) if you want to be comfortable.  Also, please note the fringe is a bit fragile so you can expect to lose a string or two in the course of the evening.  Otherwise it was just right for a flapper costume on a budget."
3.0,"I ordered this costume for a '20s party, Chose an XL because I wear a size 12-14 (sometimes larger in the bust) but was pretty disappointed in how flimsy this costume was made and how short and tight it was. It was not too expensive and I would have kept it but it was so short I couldn't even bend over to pick something up let alone sit in it. I returned it and the company was great about crediting my account and accepting the return. too bad, it is a fun costume."
1.0,"I bought this so-called costume and i had so many problems with it. Problem number one: the size is all wrong. I am usually in a large, but this time I decided to just make sure it would fit. I could not even get this dress over my torso. I ended up giving it to my size 6 roommate who was able to fit into perfectly, not too big and not too small, but we then ran into the second problem: it sheds! Our room was littered with strings of the dress here and there. It was simply atrocious!!! It was simply horrid!!"
2.0,"I usually wear a size 2 and i ordered a small- the top was almost too big but around my hips and butt was tiny! no room to move at all. Also, i ordered it in white and a word of warning- it is very see through! The whole dress also looks extremely cheap and im almost afraid it will fall apart but i need it for a party so will be wearing it anyway."
4.0,"I liked the flapper costume. But, be warned it is very tight fitting - I was thankful that I bought a size larger than I usually would. It also is a costume & is not very well made - so strings were falling off of it the entire time I was wearing it. It was a fun costume, but probably only good for this one year."
4.0,"I was an adorable flapper in this costume! It's not the same quality as if you're buying a fancy dress, but as a costume it withstood a few nights of dancing and still looks good enough to wear next year.
BE AWARE - I am a Medium but that size didn't fit me at all. The dress is sewn very straight on the sides and so it wouldn't fit over my hips and came up too short -way too small. I ordered the Large and it fit perfectly, so order a size bigger than you normally would."
4.0,"As some of the other buyers mentioned, it's not made of great material, but it's a typical halloween costume, so it's as expected.  In terms of the size, it is as described - I'm a solid 4 and medium was a bit too big.  The dress is also a bit long, but can be easily tucked in, to make it more interesting :D"
4.0,"The product arrived in no time and was of great quality!!! It has give me confidence in Amaon, and would buy from this company again!"
5.0,"I wasn't expecting too much from all the reviews I looked at. However, I was surprised at the durability of this costume. It's perfect! I loved it! Every time I wear it I feel woman empowered. It was perfect for my cabaret :)"
2.0,"Quality is kind of what I expected from a costume...only made to wear once. The fringe isn't as full as the picture shows, a lot of the lycra sheath shows through and is see-through.

Also, it fits really small. I wear a medium or a large in most things and I ordered a large to be on the safe side to fit my larger chest...but I can barely shimmy it on over my hips! Not enough time to return so I guess I'll be wearing spanx and sucking in at my costume party."
2.0,"This dress was not of good quality.  As I walked across the room, I looked like I was shedding fringes.  Also, the cloth used to make the dress was cheap."
4.0,"The costume came very quickly and included a head band with feather which I wasn't expecting.  As for the size, I'm glad I read reviews because the costume does run small.  I usually wear 8/10 but opted for the extra large size since people said it ran slim through hips.  The extra large fits perfectly!"
4.0,"This costume wasn't bad. I ordered the medium because the provided size chart said that would fit a regular size 8-10 (I'm normally an 8) I got the costume about 4 days after ordering and when I tried it on, it was VERY tight and I was almost afraid to wear it out! But it seems to stretch some after being worn and was very cute and everyone loved it!"
5.0,I got this for my husband for Christmas - it arrived quickly and in perfect condition - but best of all he loves it! The color is a nice rich brown and the softness feels wonderful to his skin.
4.0,"This is to be a Christmas gift.  My initial inspection was favorable.  It arrived quickly and is exactly what I ordered.

Thank you."
5.0,"Just what I was hoping for: ""plush"", and comfy. Easy to wash and quick to dry. Shipment was quick as well. Would purchase other items from vendor in future! Thank you."
5.0,"wonderful, quality product, very much worth the price.  It's kinda on the big side though, if you are petite."
4.0,"I guess I should have known that an ultra plush bathrobe would be warm, but this robe is almost uncomfortably warm unless the house is cold.  That said, it is soft, the length is perfect (mid-shin), and it does everything that you would want a robe to do.  I would suggest, however, that you not purchase this robe unless you live in a climate with actual seasons (i.e., not Texas), as you may find it to be too warm to actually wear it."
2.0,"It won't help you get dry, it's more of a robe to hang out. I had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund."
5.0,Very soft and plush.
5.0,"Very soft, warm and roomy.  Sleeves were too long however.  Love it"
5.0,Very soft and cuddly.. just like the prior reviews.
5.0,"Man, this thing is WARM! I like to keep the house cool in winter to avoid running up the heating bill and to reduce my carbon footprint. This thing is a HUGE help with that. It is thick and super warm. It is also bulky, so if you want to look slender around the house this is not going to help you with that. It runs large and the fabric is very thick. But it is seriously warm. The house can be 57 degrees and I'm comfortable in this, with leg warmers, a poly fleece nightgown, and warm slippers. Just love this robe. And it launders like a champ, too."
5.0,"This is the SOFTEST plush robe!! I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. I read the reviews before purchasing and noticed that many people commented on the unisex sizing, so I ordered a Medium even though my husband usually wears a large in shirts/sweaters. The Medium is perfect for him. For reference, he is 5'7"" and has pretty broad shoulders and chest, and the robe wraps around him with room to spare. It reaches about mid-calf. This robe will be on my wishlist next year!!"
1.0,"This robe is not worth the price. My husband bought it for me for Christmas. Personally I didn't like the color (which is obviously changeable) but it felt cheap. I assume he paid $20 for it. When I found out it was $85, I immediately asked him to return it. Also very heavy & bulky. Not a fan at all. And honestly disappointed on how well its rated on Amazon."
5.0,"This robe was exactly what my wife was needing.  It is very plush, keeping her warm down to her ankles.  I am very pleased with the product.  If it holds up over time it will be money well spent.  My wife fell in love immediately upon putting it on."
5.0,"Got one as a gift for my wife.  She loved it so much that I had to get one for myself.  Wow, so warm and soft yet not heavy at all.  Use the manufacturer's guide for size selection."
5.0,"Got this for my 98 year old mom who is always cold.  Warned by other reviewers that it runs very, very large, I ordered the XS which ended up fitting perfectly (she usually wears a S or M).  Her skin is very sensitive and she won't wear anything the slightest bit rough or scratchy.  The fleece is very soft and she has lived in the robe since it arrived. It is quite warm and she loves the pockets for her tissues."
5.0,Warm and soft. Very comfortable.
5.0,"Knowing the sizing is unisex is key - I read other reviews, and got the info in time to change the size!  I love it! Soft, warm, well-made of quality fleece.  Not even very linty (I wash everything before wearing the first time.)  I would definitely recommend.  I almost wish it was winter already so I could wear it more... :)"
5.0,"I absolutely love this robe, it is very soft and warm without the heaviness of a cotton spa robe."
5.0,LOVE this robe!
5.0,"I bought the extra small for my wife, who is 4'11"" and the length is good.  This is a very thick and soft robe. She's happy, so I'm happy."
5.0,So soft and warm!  It's like a wearable blanket.
5.0,Oh sooo comfortable. Bought one for my wife on mothers day but decided I needed too. Now we are all matchy. If you could take sex and put it in robe form this is it.
5.0,Got this for my mother and she loves it
5.0,"I got this for a family member, and she said it's the best bathrobe that she's ever owned. She reported that the fit is as expected, and it's soft and cozy - perfect for wearing all day for a lazy day around the house. She also said that it's very warm and retains body heat well."
5.0,"Definitely a pricy robe... but it is SO worth it. This robe is super soft and cozy. It kept me so warm all winter,  I would highly recommend it!"
4.0,"I little to large, but super warm and cozy"
5.0,I am a big ole boy. Was worried it would be too small...But plenty of room.
4.0,This robe is the warmest robe I've ever worn.  It is a great robe but better for a person who lives in a cold winter climate.  It is so warm that I can only wear it if the temp hits the freezing mark. That's not often since I live in the south.
4.0,"Wraps me up warmly. Washes well. I wanted one to go down to the floor, large enough to feel snuggled in, and that I could just throw through the wash. I'm super happy."
5.0,Really nice robe. I live it. Only problem is ...It is too warm sometimes and I'm cold all the time. Arrived on time and great quality
4.0,I got mine and love the color and plushness of the fabric.  This is a very thick robe!  Problem:  way too big.  I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be big so I would wrap it way around my body and have lots of room for lounging.  I had to send it back because it was just too big.  I will be getting a smaller size of the same product.  I am interested in seeing how it washes... not sure about that yet.
5.0,Soft and warm
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this robe!  It is warm and quite comfortable!  I am tall and length hits me at mid-calf. Great value!!  Looking forward to wearing it for the rest of the winter."
5.0,Incredibly soft and warm!
5.0,My wife loves the robes fit and softness!
2.0,"I liked the color, and the fabric, but was just much too large for me. I had a medium, but it would have fitted a very large person!"
5.0,Perfect bathrobe- Nice and warm for cold winters. A little bulky but I love it.
5.0,I love it!!!
5.0,Very nice
5.0,It was a gift and the recipient loves it.
4.0,"This bathrobe is exactly what I wanted in terms of fit and comfort.  On cold nights in the Pacific Northwest, this robe is oh so warm and goes all the way to my ankles.  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the dye job.  The color does not look like the burgundy in the picture at all, but rather like some faded pastel version of it.  But I bought it for warmth, not appearance, so I will keep it."
5.0,"This robe is everything I hoped it would be!  Just got it, and I love it!!  It's soft and warm and cuddly, and yet it's not heavy feeling to me.  I don't think this is a robe to wear when you get out of the shower.  This is a snuggly, watch TV, sit-by-the-fire kind of robe.

I ordered the Large in the Almond color.  I'm 5'6"", with short legs, and about 130 lbs. with average measurements for that height/weight.  I like plenty of wrap-around in a robe, so the size large is perfect for me, but some people would think it's too big.  A medium actually would probably fit me ""normally"" without so much wrap-around.

When I have it cinched around my waist, the length is about 2 inches above my ankles.  The sleeve length is great for me, but I guess some people would think they are a little long, since I got the Large.  They go over the top part of my hand, and I have normal-length arms.  They could be rolled up, too, if you wanted.

I really like the almond color.  It's like a stuffed teddy bear.
Can't wait to wear it when it's cold when I'm visiting the mountains!"
5.0,"This robe is exactly what I wanted.  It is lightweight and warm.  Love the color, I ordered cranberry."
4.0,"Wish it were a little smaller, if you come right out of the shower it does not absorb water well, but overall feels like being wrapped in a fluffy blanket. I really like the pockets..."
5.0,"I just love this robe.  Never felt that way before but it's so comfy.  I read alot of the reviews and understood that it ran a bit bigger in size so I wasn't surprised by it, I kinda like my robe a little roomy.  The color was almond like the description said.  Very glad I purchased this robe."
2.0,Soft but very bulky and heavy.  I was looking for a robe that was warm but lighter - ended up giving it away!
1.0,"Quite possibly the ugliest garment I have ever purchased. I look as though I'm being swallowed by a giant teddy bear. The robe is quite warm, but the fit is so boxy and oversized, it is actually difficult to move around in.  I removed the tags because I thought I could grow to like it, instead my dislike of it grew, and now it is headed for the donation bin."
5.0,"I bought this for my wife as a gift. She absolutely loves her robe, and has worn it everyday since. It is very warm and soft."
5.0,love it
2.0,Not as flushing or comfortable very baggy
2.0,I ordered an EXTRA small and it was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,Warm & cozy
4.0,It's very warm and soft.
5.0,Warm and wonderful. This is my second one!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!
5.0,"This robe is very warm, soft and plushy.  I like it a lot."
5.0,Looks Nice!
5.0,"I love it, but I have to return it for a larger size.  I went through the sizing chart, but it was too short in the arms.  It's so fabulously cozy though ~ I can't wait to get my next on in the correct size!"
5.0,"Very heavy material. Do not purchase unless you would like it to help keep you warm. Very baggy fit, which I love."
5.0,"Great product very thick, excellent for winter and very warm, not good for summer robe"
5.0,"This robe is the greatest for the colder months of the year. I bought it in January, and it is just exactly what I wanted. It fits well, is warm, soft, comes almost to my ankles...I am 5' 4"".  I absolutely LOVE it. I live in Texas, so it is not for the summertime, but I have always had two robes; one for the summer and one like this for the winter."
4.0,Nice robe but definitely runs large!
5.0,"My husband is 6' tall and around 165-170 lbs. He usually wears mediums for shirts and bottoms (32"" waist). The medium was huge on him so we opted for the small, which was still a good length (at or slightly below the knees) and baggy enough to be a comfortable robe. Very soft and not much static!"
5.0,This robe is is exactly what I expected. It couldn't be more plush! Light weight yet warm & cozy.  The fit is perfect!  Very pleased in Kansas!
5.0,"Soft, plush, roomy and warm."
4.0,I had it taken in. I ordered it too large thinking it would fit small . Not the case.
5.0,"Absolutely perfect, exactly what I wanted.  And yes, the reviews are true....it is exceptionally, wonderfully warm!  Great length as well, just above the ankle and I am 5'7""."
5.0,"First of all, I was able to get this robe for less money than on the Plush Necessities site.  I would normally wear a medium but purchased a large to assure it would be snuggly and comfy.  Well, this robe runs LARGE and when wrapped around me feels like a blanket.  I am keeping it because it will serve my purpose for wrapping up and reading, watching TV or lounging.  It is very very warm, the fabric is thick and plush.  It is not the soft fluffy fleece or microfiber you will find in the malls.  If you get warm very easily or live in warm climates, this will be too heavy.  If you want to feel like you are snuggling in a cloud and staying toasty warm, then this is perfect.  The light blue is a very light soft color and will definitely show stains easier than the darker colors."
4.0,"Good quality buy despite the cold New England Winters, my wife says that she gets too warm wearing it.

The size runs large."
5.0,"This robe is soft, warm, a bit on the large size and altogether very cuddly.  People looking for a truly full-length robe will find it here-none of this three or four  inches above the ankle business.  I have washed the robe and am pleased that it did not shrink or  become pilled .  The  color (which though called charcoal, to my eye has an underlying hint of blue) did not fade.  The armholes are generous, the sleeves long enough to turn up should I want to  do some chores.  The lapels are nice and wide and the inner tie actually is long enough to tie and of the  same material as the robe, so no cold satin against the skin.  I recommend this robe  for anyone who wants comfort and ease when they  put on a  bathrobe.  Amazing!"
5.0,"Arms could have been a bit longer, other than that excellent robe!  Very Warm!!"
5.0,"This may be the best thing I have ever bought for myself.  Soft, warm and comfortable for this northern girl. No, it doesn't make you look like a super model and has no shape whatsoever. You can wear all the silk gowns, and flowing summery robes all you want but when it comes down to it, this is the robe you will reach for when it's freezing  outside and chilly in the house. Hey, you can always wear the pretty pj's under the robe and still be roasty toasty. Seriously, buy this robe for yourself, and one for everyone you know for the holidays. Love it!"
5.0,This robe is still going strong 6.5 years after the purchase.  Very nice material.
5.0,So supper soft
4.0,I was hoping it would be softer but I still like it.
4.0,Wonderful bathrobe!  Very soft and warm - it kept me warm during this past horrible snowy winter. Holds up well through numerous washes.
5.0,Love it!
5.0,my husband bought my first robe 8 years ago after I had a stroke and it is still soft and comfortable.  washes beautifully.  we moved to snow country and  i was ready for a change and would not purchase one here; so he saw same and ordered me a lush brown one.  Love it.  eveen more comfortable ans snugly.  he likes it too so  said order your own!  so spoiled can't think of another brand robe!8
5.0,"This is the robe I've been looking for.  I had ordered a verrrry thick (and equally long) terry robe a few weeks earlier and just found the extreme weight of it to be offputting every time I reached for it.  I thought - I do need the warmest robe (and full ankle length) I can find, but does it really have to be SO heavy?  Then I went searching and found THIS robe - got it today and it envelopes my body wonderfully just like the terry robe, but it's LIGHT.  Thick, plush and light.  I am every bit as warm, but far more comfortable, and it has a really good quality fluffy texture -- doesn't look cheap or tacky as some micro fiber or synthetic robes I've seen which have more of the look of fake fur or a skimpy uneven pile or a ""trailer trash"" look; grungy, old and lived in from day one.  No, this robe looks luxurious and evokes a spa, and somehow as thick as it is, it even manages not to make you look enormous, that part was a surprise.

The only thing I would wish if for another 2-3 inches in length.  I am 5'9"", 140 pounds, and ordered the large. I really couldn't go with X or XX Large just for more length - the bottom of the robe comes to 7 inches from the ground (or 3 inches from my ankles) - pretty much like the photo of the man - it doesn't come as far down as the one the woman is wearing (clearly she's shorter).  I get that robe makers can't please everyone and I'm somewhat tall for a woman so they can't make robes long enough for me that would drag the floor for other women. But I wish it was longer anyway.  I do feel the draft on the few inches of my exposed ankles.  And no I don't want to bend my aching back in the morning to struggle with pulling on socks in the morning before I have my coffee.  The whole point of a robe and slippers is you just stumble groggily and slip easily into them and done - an all-in-one solution.  Oh well, otherwise this robe is as good as it gets - I combed the entire internet comparing them all."
5.0,"I received this robe for Christmas, loved it and ordered one for my husband. Fits well and washes well."
5.0,"OMG!!!!!  Never want to get dressed again.  The softest, cuddliest,  most snuggly robe ever created."
5.0,It feels sooooooo good.  I love wearing it and hate for the time to come to get dressed.  It is the most cozy comfy robe I have ever had.
5.0,"After many failed attempts with other robes, this was the perfect choice.  It fits well and it is super comfortable.  It is fleecy and warm without being too hot like one of the bamboo fabrics I tried.  I love it!"
4.0,"Beautiful and soft robe, but it was way to big! I had to return it."
5.0,"I reviewed another robe as being too big, but this robe is perfect. This the full 58"" long, so it reaches the tops of ny feet when I stand 5'6"" tall. I'm washing it for the first time right now but I expect good things. The robe is deliciously soft and cuddly warm. I love everything about this robe. I wish there was a pale green color."
4.0,"This is a very plush robe and would keep a person very warm.  My Mom is very petite and it is just a litle too big for her, even though it's a petite small.  I would still recommend this robe, however, as it does have a nice feel to it and seems worth the price."
5.0,My daughter loves it!
5.0,"very warm, light, & cozy--very well made"
5.0,"This robe is exactly what I needed.  It's light weight but so very comfortable.  I keep my house a little cool but occasionally need to warm up without turning up the heat, well I couldn't ask for a better wrap. I ordered a XXL which gives me more than enough room. The stitching is phenomenal and the quality is excellent.  I'd recommend this product to everyone even though it is a little pricey.  Thanks for a great robe."
2.0,I am returning this item.
5.0,Fit as expected.  First one lasted 8 yrs!
5.0,"This robe is soft, long and WARM even for winter in MAINE.  This is definitely a comfort purchase, rather than a fashion statement!  I love it."
4.0,Very nice robe.
3.0,ok
3.0,"Not as plush as I thought it would be.  I do not think, based on the material, it was worth the $80 I paid for it."
5.0,I love this robe!  Its lightweight but so very warm!  Perfect even in -10 weather on the porch to retrieve the paper!
4.0,"The robe is a little large, but I don't mind. It seems a little too lightweight and not quite as warm as I would wish.
But I am rather pleased with it."
3.0,"I ordered this robe based on reviewers saying it was really warm. Looks like it will be - in which case I will forgive the two disappointments. First, there is the swimmingly large fit in the size small. I did not catch on to the unisex sizing until too late. Second, a problem occurred with the first wash. Because the robe arrived with a faint chemical smell I immediately washed it, separately, so the color would not run. My high efficiency front loading washing machine could not perform its spin cycle due to the weight of the water in the fabric and the unbalanced load. So the whole sopping wet mess had to be wrung out repeatedly over the next two days and finally air dried for a few hours in the dryer and overnight outside. Fortunately I live in a dry climate."
5.0,"Very generously sized.  I bought the small at 5'-5"" and 150# and there's plenty of room!!  In retrospect I would have ordered the XS but I don't mind the extra wrap-around room.  The robe is very soft, very warm, and has a lovely large collar."
3.0,"Very bulky and heavy, very hot.  I leave it on a chair in my bedroom and the cat seems to love it."
5.0,The material is beautiful. It fits perfectly and looks great
5.0,"When I got this robe as a birthday present my first thought was, ""Well, this is ugly.""  My husband reassured me that it had terrific reviews and was super warm.  He was right!  (Don't tell him I said so)  I am the one that is either constantly turning up the thermostat or dragging a personal heater around the house or am wrapped up in a blanket.  Well, no more.  This is a wonderful, comfortable, and WARM robe."
5.0,"My wife loved it, and it's made well.it did not fall after it was cleaned."
5.0,wonderful
5.0,"This robe is a blast.  Bought it as a gift for the wife, but when she's at work, this stay at home dad pampers himself in luxury with this robe.  Neither the wife nor I are petite folks, and this robe swims on her, envelopes her completely.  It fits me like one would expect a robe to.  The thick plush is ultra warm, and amazingly soft, but be warned, when laundering, be generous with the fabric softener or it will lose a little of that super snuggly muppet vagina feel.  It is truly awesome to cuddle into this robe on a cold winter's day, especially if pairing that with an at home foot bath or some aromatherapy candles."
5.0,"Comfortable, long (I am 5'9) and it covers my ankles, and it's very warm. I love it!  The lint goes away after first wash"
5.0,fit as expected and gave the comfort desired - was a replacement for and older robe that had seen its lifetime of ware
4.0,I purchased this robe several years ago and I found it very soft and roomy.  So after wearing it most evenings  I decided it was time to buy another.  A person who likes warmth and room in their bathrobes should like this robe.
5.0,"Wish I had ordered this sooner. Comfy and WARM.Love it. Going to buy a couple more at Christmas for friends. Highly recommend.
Love the color too. Chocolate."
5.0,"Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She was concerned about the fit after reading some reviews, but she says it fits great.  She got the medium (her normal size) and though she could have gotten the small, the medium allows her plenty of room to wrap up without being too bulky.
We keep our house at about 67 degrees F in the winter and she says it keeps her toasty warm.
Great product.  Very satisfied with purchase."
2.0,I am a small petite woman; typically wear a size 4 and it is huge on me!  Very warm; almost too warm...........kind of disappointed I didn't just return it............
5.0,"I got this for my wife for Christmas because she's almost always cold.  She had asked for a ""warm, cozy robe"", and this delivered!  Normally she would be a size small, but after reading the reviews and seeing that they seem to run big, I ordered an extra-small.  Even it was slightly big, but fit well enough.  My wife says that this thing is very cozy, and sometimes even a little too warm, but she loves it.  The length is good for her (5' 3"") and weight is perfect.  She's very happy with the robe."
5.0,"This robe is so lightweight,so very soft inside and outside,and such a pretty blue that it feels like ""wearing clouds"". Awesome find!"
2.0,"I purchased this robe for my mom, it was way too large and too hot. Returned the robe, but she did like the material."
5.0,My husband and I both have this robe and we both love it. It's like getting a big hug! Warm and toasty.
5.0,"fast shipping! very soft material, warm as excepted.  looks and feels great. my wife's new fav robe by far now!"
4.0,"This is absolutely the softest, warmest, cuddliest robe I've ever seen!  I truly love it.  I would have gone with 5 stars but It was a little large for a medium and the collar is a bit too plush and thick. It is truly full length on me but I'm 5'3"" so...
The instant you put this on you are warm!"
5.0,"Nice and warm, great color, and fits as it should. Hope it washes and maintains it's fluff. Pleased with the purchase so far."
2.0,I didn't pick the right size. It drags on the floor even after trying to wash and dry it. It is comfy though.
5.0,bought this for my wife based on reviews. Like the reviews said it runs big. but I ordered with that info and it fits great and is just what she wanted.
5.0,"THE ROBE it fits great  I love the feel and it looks great ,i am glad I bought it. its a good buy!!!"
2.0,"The robe is the correct color, feels fantastic but it is huge.  My wife is 5' 4"" tall and 115 pounds.  She wears a Small in everything she has.  The shoulders would fit a linebacker and it wraps around her twice.  If they had an extra small I would return it."
2.0,"I was looking for a robe that fit the full length of my body from neck to ankles, and this fulfilled that. I'm 5'3"", I ordered the small, and the length is perfect. In addition, it is warm and soft and lightweight as described.

However, nearly everything else didn't work for me:

1) I ordered the red color and it looked faded, not nearly as rich and lush as the red shown in the picture, it was more like rust. Not a big deal if color doesn't matter for you. It just bothered me that I paid 85 dollars for this and it looks ratty out of the box. I would advise getting a lighter color like the lavender.

2) Next, while the length was exactly what I was looking for, the width of this robe is extremely wide. I wear a women's size 4 pants and this robe has just too much fabric to fit comfortably. It is bulky on me. What's weird is that the arms were an exact fit, so if I went down a size to X-Small, I think the arms would be too short.

All this to say, it would have been worth the money for me if the fit was more precise. If that were the case, I'd just send it back with a color change. Needless to say, it's being returned for full refund. My search for a full length robe continues."
5.0,"A perfect fit.  I bought this robe for my daughter and she loves it.  I was upset because one inside tie was missing, but she cut the other one off as she did not want to return it.  Se would not take it off."
5.0,This is my new winter robe! It is very thick and very warm so it is great for NewEngland weather!
3.0,"My wife is about  5 feet tall. The small was too big and did not want to risk the extra small. As another reviewer said, the shoulder seams are wide. Perhaps they lean to men's proportions. Otherwise the robe was fine."
3.0,"The color isn't as deep cranberry as in the photo, a bit lighter, not as nice. I also found the robe a bit too bulky."
5.0,"I am very pleased with the robe's warmth, soft touch and weight and fit, but I would love to be given the option of a tall size for robes.  I do understand the difficulty this represents to companies, but maybe there could be an un-hemmed version that we could take to the tailors.  If un-hemmed robes were available, we would have the ability to make it the garment full length and keep our ankles warm.  Cold feet are one of the main problems for many people, and a full length robe is a much more elegant look than one that is cropped at the ankles.  Of course, if it came un-hemmed, one could also crop it at the ankles if that is the desired length.

I expect this robe will wash and dry like a dream, too, although I haven't tested it yet since it is a gift.  The only other suggestion I would make is that I would love to have options of having an option of maybe a few very feminine robes with gorgeous A lines with flattering colors (like this cranberry color) suitable for new mothers and Valentine's Day and Mother's Day and Christmas, etc., to remind women of their feminine beauty without sacrificing cozy!...with matching slippers!!!"
5.0,"She wears it all the time in the winter. She tends to feel cold, and it keeps her extremely warm."
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and she absolutely loves it. She said it is the best robe she has ever had. So soft and comfortable she loves cuddling in it and drinking her cup of hot tea.

 It fits her great, I am so happy I bought this for her thinking of getting one my self.

 It keeps her warm on cold winter nights."
5.0,"The product is excellent. Good design, color, quality and style. He covered my expectations resulting a good investment. I recommend this product. -"
4.0,"This was my first experience buying a bathrobe over the internet, and it worked out pretty well.  The robe fits, I love the color, and it keeps me warm.  The pictures showed sleeves without cuffs, and I was disappointed to find that the robe has bulky cuffs.  They are a nuisance in the kitchen so I don't use the robe as often as I would if it had straight sleeves. Otherwise it's fine."
3.0,"Not as absorbent as terry, but holds on to your body heat much better.  This is a winter robe for sure.  Don't thin kI would call it light weight, it has some bulk to it."
5.0,"Girlfriend loves it, wears it every day. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a present for their significant other. I personally went for Valentine's Day."
5.0,"It's very soft and cozy. Many people said it runs large so I bought the XS. My wife is 5'3"" and it goes down to just above her ankles (which she likes)."
4.0,"Got this robe for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it, extra soft and warm, the only problem is she now has to share it with my cat because she also seems to like the warmth and softness."
5.0,"This robe is just what I wanted. It is thick and soft and oh so cozy. The length is good, for me between ankle and calf. I'm pretty short. There is a lot of material through the middle. It is definitely not form-fitting or terribly sexy, but I think it's awesome. Since I got it, I seem to be in it whenever I'm home."
2.0,Too heavy. The fabric is soft but garment feels heavy and constricting. It would just be too much when worn with a nightgown underneath.
5.0,it's nice and warm. I love how soft the fabric feels. I never thought buying a new robe would be so hard.
5.0,Made a great Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it and says it is very soft and very warm. Looks good on her too!
5.0,"Can't believe something so lightweight can be so warm!  It's plenty long, soft, and cozy.  There is minimal lint, even on the first washing.  It's comparable to many high end robes that cost a lot more."
5.0,"Bought this for my husband, because he wanted an ankle length robe.  It is nice and long...it comes to just above his ankles.  It's very warm, too.  If you email the seller, they will help you with sizing, which I found very helpful."
5.0,"What else can I say, it does what it is suposed to do. Now you demand seven more words.  7"
4.0,I purchased this for my wife.  Only reason i did not give it five stars is because my wife doesn't comment on how great it is.  She did say that it was exactly what she wanted and that it was comfortable and soft.  She spends a fair amount of Sundays in it so i assume she likes it.
2.0,"I was looking for a light, warm, and - most important - full-length robe. This one is full-length, but it's just too hot and too bulky-looking. Not very flattering."
5.0,"I ordered this robe for my 88 year old mother back east. I was told by my sister, that it is beautful and very soft and will be very warm on my mother. I am so happy to know this. She says it is really lovely and arrived as new."
4.0,"Both my husband and I have been using these robes all winter and we love them. They are very warm and comfortable. I'm not sure how much we will be able to use them as it starts getting warmer though so if you're looking for a good year-round robe, this probably isn't for you unless you live somewhere where it never really gets hot.

My only complaint would be that the robe tends to attract pet hair and lint balls and whatever else may be floating around the house and washing it doesn't seem to make much of a difference sometimes. I feel silly having to take a lint roller to a robe but I do it about every other wash."
3.0,"Robe is not as soft and fluffy as hoped.  It has a more course rough look to it.  However, it serves its purpose on a cold morning."
5.0,"Was so pleasantly surprised by this robe.  Got it for my daughter-in-law and she was so pleased!  She wraps up in it every night because its so soft and warm.  Long so its a great cover after a time in the hot tub.  its so hard to find a good product in this size , so it is really appreciated."
4.0,"Bought this for my wife at Christmas.  Yes it is cozy and warm, but out of the box it had a ""stale"" odor.  One cycle thru the washer and dryer solved the problem.  She now wears it daily."
5.0,"This is the softest and warmest robe I have ever purchased and is ideal for keeping warm in a cold weather climate like Minnesota.  If you live in a warm weather climate, it will be too warm.  So far the robe is not shedding at all, unlike other fleece robes I have purchased in the past.  For the warmth, it is also very lightweight.  I am 6' and 175 pounds with very long arms.  The size XL fits me just right.  I use it mainly for lounging early and late in the day.  The robe is a little pricy, but you will get your money's worth."
2.0,"I found a bathrobe for 15.00 dollars that was nicer just a little less warmer. I had bought this one prior to the microfiber one I bought through you,even paid extra to get it here sooner. The collar on the robe,it's just... weird. My wife washed this one before she knew I had the other one so was unable to return and for 15.00 dollars and nicer robe we kept that one. I was expecting a higher quality product for the price."
5.0,I purchased this robe for my son-in-law who thought it was too luxurious!! It is a very nice robe and came very quickly. I had no problems with this order.
5.0,"I purchased the robes for my mother and sister as Christmas gifts.  They both loved the robes.  They are plush, warm, cozy and soft.  Perfect to put on and take the edge off the cold, freezing winter days and when just getting out of the shower.  This product comes with the highest recommendation of the gift giver and gift receivers!"
5.0,"This is an excellent robe. It is soft. warm and very durable. I am really happy with it, it has lived up to all my expectations."
5.0,"I got this robe as a gift.  It's very comfy, especially on cold winter days.  Nice color too.  You can't always find dark colors and I'm not much for pastels."
5.0,"I selected this robe for my daughter and when it arrived I fell in love with it.  Now I hope someone will send me one!  It is just as advertised...plush, soft, lightweight yet warm.  Any woman would love it."
5.0,"I am always amazed at how many Married with Children fans are out there. I have owned this for a few years and has held up very well, and one of my favorite shirts along with the NO'MAAM shirt.

Buy this shirt if you are a Married with Children fan."
3.0,It's not like the one Al Bundy wears. My husband wanted the same one Al Bundy wears.
4.0,"Good replica of Al Bundy's Polk High gear
Size a little bigger than expected"
5.0,These are quality shirts that will help relive your golden years when going to Polk High meant something.
5.0,"Best best belt I have ever had, last longer than other belt I have ever used.  Highly recommend this item."
1.0,"I received the wrong buckle with my belt. I ordered the black open face buckle and received a cheap buckle instead. The invoice and packing slip were both for the correct buckle, however that is not what I received."
5.0,"Same as I had when I was in the military.  The belt (44"") is perfect for my 36"" waist and can be cut at the buckle side to shorten.

If you are looking for a stronger BDU belt, you may want to consider the Spec-Ops Better BDU Belt in 1.75""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spec-Ops-Brand-Better-BDU-Belt/dp/B004WF4WSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spec-Ops Brand Better BDU Belt</a>&nbsp;or 1.5""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spec-Ops-Brand-Better-BDU-Belt-1-5-Inch/dp/B004WF5194/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spec-Ops Brand Better BDU Belt 1.5-Inch</a>"
1.0,"Advertised as a black open face buckle, but in fact is shipped with a SILVER closed face buckle, and silver-end belt tip, all labeled#4290BLK....NOT what is shown in ad!"
5.0,"Just like being in the army again.  I always liked the simplisity of the belt, lasts along time and adjusts to the size of the day, everyday."
5.0,I needed an extra belt for my work pants. This is a great belt to own. These are the only belts I buy now. I like how adjustable they are. I can't stand any other belt. They are nice and flexible. I love it.
5.0,Good belt for golfing
5.0,Just what I wanted.
4.0,what i wanted
5.0,"Excellent belt that won't slip once it is fastened.  There is enough length to fit any waist and easily cut to your size.  Not fancy, but built to take it and last!"
5.0,Just what I needed for work belt just like my uniform belt.
3.0,"I bought this since my old Army belt is too small.  I guess due to age my belly gotten little bigger.  My original Army belt is really nice.  Love the Army belt, US made buckle, hold tight, and never stretch like leather belts.  The one I bought has a thinner belt material and the buckle is more like it's a stamped steel type Made in Taiwan.  I chunked the stamped steel Made in Taiwan in the trash and kept the belt.  So far so good, will just have wait and see how long the belt material will hold."
5.0,Just like the ones I used to wear back in the US Army!  Perfect.
3.0,"It's cheaply made compared to the belts the Army uses; wouldn't trust it with my life. Still, it works; can be cut to length."
5.0,Nice
4.0,This belt is hard to find these days since the military went to their new uniform. I like this belt because it stays in place and doesn't slip when I move around. It is cheaper quality than the army belt that I had but it will last for awhile.
5.0,"very well made, holds up well"
5.0,I like this belt . I wear it a lot. It was a good buy. I had these kind of belts when I was in the service.
4.0,"It may not be high end but I'm impressed, it works as advertized. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one"
5.0,"While it seems like it might be just a little lighter that the one I wore for several years in the army, it is still very substantial and should last for years."
1.0,"I once used a BDU belt to hold up a drive shaft while we replaced a transmission on a deuce and a half. This isn't the same quality. But it's good enough to hold up my pants while I mow the yard. The buckle has ""made in Taiwan"" stamped on the back. And the buckle keeps popping loose and sliding off the belt. This is more Rothco style junk."
3.0,DOES THE JOB BUT I WOULD NOT TRUST THEM WEARING A TOOL BELT WORKS GOOD WITH A PAIR OF SHORTS
5.0,It's exactly what I expected for this style of belt. Buckle grabs webbing just fine. Webbing is a bit rough to the touch but that will smooth out with use.
5.0,"Works great, very durable and very well made......def will buy again if needed! Works well with holding holster for gun"
4.0,"I bought this military spec black belt and buckle after my original ones from Uncle Sam gave out on me (nearly 15 years later).  The material is not as high end as the original standard issued ones, but they are identical.  The ones issued by Uncle Sam were, of course, made in America.  While these are made in Taiwan.  But so far the buckle has lasted me a few months now, so we'll see how many years use I'll get out of these Taiwanese models."
5.0,"Great quality. I've had it over a year now and it's still going strong. No pulls in the material, no bending or flaws in the buckle assembly. I will definitely buy this product again."
4.0,"It's only been a few weeks. Not sure how long it will last.
Almost as thick and sturdy as I remember...But still a good product.
We will see."
5.0,fit holds and is very strong .I am a large active guy the belt works well for me and I am not easy on products
5.0,Got my first one in the service (83).  Have been using them ever since.  Always keep a couple available.  Never know when you (or your son or daughter) may need one
5.0,true military belt good quality very pleased with the belt very strong and looks to be strong and will not wear fast
5.0,I ordered a bunch of these and they are exactly what I wanted and cheaper than the ones at the PX. This is the true military one and is rated for the same test strength. I am able to use mine to hang from (I weigh usually around 175-185 pounds) and it supports me with ease and no frayed webbing. I have also used 3 of these hooked together as an emergency tow line (it was a bad day don't ask lol) and it held up with minimal frayed edges from the strain. Very good work on these!!
5.0,I've always liked the army style belts and this is just like the one I was issued 40 years ago. Good  solid design.
5.0,Love the web belt. Great when you just need a belt working out side around the house. Nice looking belt. 44 inche and can be cut to fit by removing the buckle.
5.0,"Worked great for me in the Army, works great for me now. Strong, sturdy and holds up through all kinds of weather and abuse."
5.0,Arrived early.  Immediately adjusted to length.  Great for jeans and other casual trousers.  certainly glad I found this after wearing out my GI issue!
2.0,"I wore out the belt Uncle Sam gave me. I liked it so much I bought this one as a replacement. Unfortunately, this belt is not the same quality. My real USGI belt was much thicker and the buckle is brass painted black. This belt buckle is stamped steel painted black and says made in Taiwan on the back where my real one says 'US' and has a manufacturer's stamp of some sort. I'm using my original buckle, it looks better since the paint wore off and now the brass is exposed and it's higher quality. Tossed the stamped steel one that came attached to the belt in the garbage."
5.0,"Briefly, I had a childhood accident 30+ years ago that caused arthritis in my foot.  Not bad, but a constant, nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with.  Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.

They're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.

Admittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.

In short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100."
4.0,"This is a pretty good set of costume accessories for Halloween.  Patch feels a bit cheap, but its not abrasive and it works, the earring is pretty well made for the price.  All in all, great set of Halloween accessories for kids (heck, it would probably work for adults too)."
3.0,"got this for my sons Halloween and for dress up play.  The eye patch is nice, bigger than other ones I have seen which fit better on my 3 & 5 year old kids.  The ear ring didn't work at all.  It was a very cheap, plastic, clip on earring, that wouldnt even open wide enough to clip onto a 5 year old ear lobe.  after I got it on I had to take it off because it hurt him.  I know its a cheap good price and the eye patch is worth it but I tossed the earring"
3.0,"The eyepatch is cheap cardboard covered in black fabric. and the earing is not real durable either. I definately over paid for this product by purchasing it online then paying for shipping. That being said, it functions great just keep in mind the eyepatch isn't real durable and I don't see the earing be very durable either."
3.0,"My soon-to-be 3 yr old wanted to be a pirate this year for Halloween.  I started with the eye patch & earing.  It arrived quickly, and is exactly as described, but he wanted no part of putting it on, lol.  I'm sure he will when he gets older, and he'll have fun with it.  It's no fault to the product, it definitely is just as its described.  Hopefully your little pirate wants to wear it!"
5.0,"I bought these along with the toddler pirate costume for my son. The clip on earring is not heavy for a 2 year old, and the eye patch was comfortable enough for my son to keep it on for a while. Very happy with the purchase."
4.0,As described
5.0,very pleased!!!!
5.0,I absolutely love this product !!!
3.0,"For this being marketed for men, the eye patch is not big at all. In addition, it's quite hard and not comfortable at all....thought it would be felt but seems to be a piece of cardboard covered with satin fabric.......for the price, will keep."
5.0,"so far I'm happy, just have to see how it hold up to wearing this weekend ;)"
4.0,Not much to it
5.0,"Great for the price. Looks as pictured. I'm 6'2"" and 230 lbs and the xl size fit perfect."
5.0,"This is a pretty good product that is certain to last for one party/Halloween and probably for a couple more. Product as described, well packaged, well made, and delivered as promised."
5.0,great added feature
4.0,The eye patch and earing are a good value.
3.0,Disposable but only needed for Gasparilla so it served it's purpose.
4.0,Funny question. lol No size
4.0,"Nothing fancy, but good."
3.0,The earring was useless. Patch was ok but overpriced
5.0,great accessory to my kid's pirate costumes for Halloween
4.0,Construction was okay but it did the job for what we needed.
5.0,"Exactly what you would expect from buying a pirate eyepatch and earring. I was pleasantly suprised to see that the eyepatch was cloth, though."
4.0,I would only recommend this as a fashion accessory to the most fab parties because if you actually need an eye patch it really sucks
5.0,Great for the price.
4.0,For the price can't complain.
5.0,Exactly what we needed for a costume party.
5.0,Pwerfect!
5.0,Perfect for pirate costume
5.0,Worked great for Halloween. The earring stayed on the whole night and the patch fit great.
2.0,"Well, I do have a big head, but the patch strap was too small, and it pressed the patch against my eyeball so it was too uncomfortable to wear. I did wear the earring, and it was just fine."
5.0,"i didn't wear the patch except for a couple of pics, but for $2, get it!"
5.0,"First of all: don't expect an item that will last 2 years of all-day use. This is for a pirate costume that you'll wear maybe once a year.

The patch is comfortable and it will do it's work. The earring is cool too and it will stay on all night if you put it right. I used it for a halloween costume and both things worked fine and hold for the entire afternoon (7pm to 5am, that's 10 hours). They look like they can hold more, so I'm packing it to use it next time again."
5.0,Arrived on time very happy with product!
5.0,For the price it's better then I was hoping for! I bought 2 one for each of my kids for Halloween. They fit my 7 and 4 year old perfectly so im not sure if it would be as comfotable for an adult. my kids and I are very happy with them
4.0,Just the thing for pirate fest. Still have it a year later.
2.0,ok
5.0,Just what we anticipated getting.
3.0,Ok...
5.0,My daughter loved being a pirate!
5.0,My niece and nephew loved playing dress up with this and I also ordered the rest of the pirate costume.
4.0,"My son loved his eye patch to be a pirate for Halloween.  This was cute.  If I could get him to wear the earring it would have been just as cute, but he said it hurt his ear since it was a clip on. :("
5.0,Exactly as expected good value and perfect pirate accessory... It even worked well with my glasses! see picture attached.
5.0,"Item is just as advertised.  We haven't used it yet, as it is going along on our Disney Cruise for our Pirates in the Caribbean party."
1.0,chinchey
3.0,Just ok!
5.0,The kids love the patch and earring. The earring uses a magnet to hold the ear. I wondered when I bought it and didn't see the answer.
5.0,Very soft and did not hurt my sons face.  This one is so much nicer than most you see in stores.
3.0,Doesn't stay on very well
5.0,The eye patch and earring were exactly as I expected and worked fine.  I probably wouldn't use an eye patch again--it really messed up my depth perception and gave me a headache (this is not the eye patch's fault).
5.0,Perfect and fast shipping
4.0,costume stuff
4.0,Great patch and earring. Pretty cheaply made but for the price it's to be expected.
3.0,Fit as expected
3.0,ok
4.0,Got this for my hubby's Halloween Costume and it worked nicely!  Costume quality but good costume quality.  Over all good purchase.
4.0,"Considering the cost, this was a good item.  The eyepatch fit pretty tightly and felt like it was pushing into my eyeball a bit.  I wish it were more comfortable to wear."
5.0,Lovely accessory for my 9 year old ! Fits perfect. and matches her outfit just right !  Thank you !
5.0,"This hat was incredibly great! I don't write reviews very often and this hat deserved one! I puchase items off the stars and reviews of others so I thought is was important to share too. We looked for a long time for a decent hat for my daughter's pirate costume and the quality,look,fit,and durability could not have been better. If your up close you can tell it's not real leather,but from a little distance you don't even notice that....great job guys!"
5.0,As advertised.- good quality - delivered on time
5.0,A perfect accessory to the costume.
5.0,Awesome
5.0,Exactly as described.
4.0,"its good, shipping was slower than they claim or itd be 4 stars"
4.0,Fit very well and did not feel like the elastic would stretch out.  Good buy.  The earring didn't clip on hard enough (possibly made for a children's ear) so it was lost within the first 5 minutes.
5.0,Worked perfectly for our purposes
5.0,Perfect accessory for the Cutthroat Pirate costume
5.0,Both fit well and will compliment the costume for the Disney Pirate Cruise Ship party.
4.0,Worked great for the cost.
2.0,"Nothing spectacular - Made in China, has the warning:
WARNING:
This product contains chemicals know to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. (This warning is given in compliance with California's Proposition 65.)"
5.0,"What can you say, price was right and it's going to get destroyed when i use it."
3.0,"As expected, for the price point. Nothing less, nothing more!"
5.0,It's just too funny!  I am going to use this in an Old Tyme Photo scenario for my brother-in-law when we dress up at Pirates!
5.0,"Took my family on a Disney Cruise a few months ago.  Disney Cruises have a pirate night where the guests are encouraged to dress like pirates on the deck.  These fit my wife and I perfectly but were slightly big for my three year old, but he could still where it.  A lot of fun for a costume accessory"
5.0,Fits well and seems it will hold up for the party use I need. earing is OK. I'm sure I will remove shortly after arriving to the party. I never find anything that clips to my ear comfortable and this is no exception. Others may find it comfortable for longer wear.
4.0,"My son loved the eye patch. It wasn't to tight. He didn't like the earring but at this price, it didn't matter."
5.0,Excellent accesories for my husbands naughty pirate costume.  We had such fun with it.  Thanks a bunch!  Dunno what else to say.
5.0,This was perfect and added a more pirate feel to my costume. Just what a pirate needs. Great buy. I recommend.
5.0,Perfect addition to my 2.5-year-old's pirate costume.  Wouldn't have looked nearly as good without them and she loved them.  Durable enough for what I wanted.
5.0,this pirate eye patch and earring set is the perfect little addition to our pirate costumes for halloween. they held up great and worked perfectly! fast shipping as well!
5.0,"These items were purchased to complete my costume for Halloween and they did the job.  I should have known that the eye patch and my glasses wouldn't go real well, but after I took off my glasses, it looked much better.  Al in all they helped me look good."
3.0,It took forever for this to get here. The earring is uncomfortable but what do you expect for a couple of bucks.
5.0,"Decent Quality.  I have to do 18 more words for a pirate patch and earring?  I can confirm that it did not make me want to rape or pillage and as far as I can tell, these are not magic."
4.0,Ever met a pirate who doesn't sport an eye patch?.  A mere necessity to show true Pirate sea worthiness.  Without it.  The custom will be lacking.
2.0,The string to the eye patch broke by the end of the night and the earring kept falling off. It looked cheap too.
5.0,"A great product for the pirate in us all.  Got it for costume and is still going strong with the kids.  It was delivered very quick and all around excellent service they even sent an extra set just in case,  impressive for such an inexpensive item."
3.0,"I couldn't fathom spending $30 on a silicone jacket for my new baby, so this one does the job. The screen protector does bubble, so I don't use it, and I'm not much of a jogger, so I pitched the armband too. But I found the covering over the click wheel actually helps cut down the sensitivity (I was having a lot of trouble mis-selecting songs because I kept brushing it with my giant thumb while trying to hit the play button). It fits perfectly, came in a good color, and it don't cost more than the clothes on my back, so I can't complain."
2.0,"When I bought this item, the idea was to use it when I workout or go running.  What I found when I recieved it was that it was really really cheap.  The silicon is thin.  That wouldnt be so bad if the plastic belt clip and the armband did not use that as the means of holding on the the IPod.  The thing feels like if I were to jump hard enough the IPod would fall out or would tear the silicon.

In my opinon, if you are planning on getting this case as a means for holding your IPod while working out or for the use of the belt clip do not get it. This thing is too cheap to hold on to your 250 - 350 dollar ipod. But if you are looking for a cheap functional case for your IPod so that it does not get scratched, go ahead and get it."
4.0,"This case keeps your iPod the way it's meant to be, THIN.  I have the pink case which looks great with my white iPod.  And it fits perfectly.

It is a little more costly with the shipping, but you get the armband, etc. etc.  Haven't used any of the accesories yet.

TIP:  If you're putting this case on a brand new iPod, peel up the original plastic protecting the front of the iPod and cut just below the screen.  This way, your screen will still be protected in the original packaging and you can save the screen protector they send for a replacement.

I do wish it covered more of the silver part near the USB and the armband holes in the back, but hey, obviously I understand you need to be able to plug it in and get the armband through. The hold switch and headphone cutouts are perfect."
4.0,"The material feels nice and soft but do attract some dusts. It fits my 30gb iPod video perfectly. It also comes with a cheap plastic screen protective guard, belt clip, silver lanyard, armband and a cellular phone booster chip?? (Not sure what this has to do with the iPOD).

Anyway, go with this if you are not looking to spend a lot of money on a decent case. But however adding the shipping cost will double the amount they ask for."
3.0,"Well i really like the material, bacause it's soft and the click wheel feels great when you scroll. i haven't tried the armband yet because i'm scared my ipod will fall out. it's on the cheap side. The screen protector is really great, all you have to do is smooth out the bumbs with a credit card. It also came with a little necklace thing to wear with your ipod. still can't figure out how to get it on. the armband also does not fit my girly arms. anyway, it good for the cheap price. you get what you pay for."
5.0,"I'm not a runner and I don't jog however, I do bike and use various exercise equipment.  For my purpose this is great.  My iPod is protected, love the light weight of the case, the armband has a very wide and long velcro closure and adjusts well to lower and upper arm areas.  The color of case does make the viewing screen area the same color of case but while I'm excersing I'm not looking at my display every 5 minutes, this is meant to be a convenience tool.  Excellent price too."
2.0,"The case itself protects the iPod very well, however if you try to use the armband for running - forget it. The material is too flimsy to give good support. My iPod bounced around on my arm so much that it froze in the middle of my run!"
2.0,The screen film leaves bubbles which affects your display.  Using the exterior A/V out will not show the picture because the case keeps the plug from being inserted all the way.
5.0,this case is perfect u get a free armband and it comes with a beltclip thats cool the black one looks awesome it protects everthing it comes with a screen protector and it protects the whole ipod body this is also a good case cuz it don't take alot of space in ur pocket its a pretty awesome case i use it when i run  and sometimes when im  playing basket ball with my friends if u love ur ipod and u don't want it to get all scratched this is a good case for that
4.0,"The watch winder works exactly as described. I think this is a good value product. Especially when compared to the multi hundreds dollar watch winders on the market. It does look a little bit plastic. But the winder is well built and is reasonably quit when turning.

It comes with 4 different timer settings and 3

different turning direction settings: left, right and alternating.

I calculated the number of rotations per day based some measurements.

Setting:

  A:  rotate 33 seconds, rest 12 minutes:  300  rotations/day

  B:  rotate 10 minutes, rest 90 minutes:  660  rotations/day

  C:  rotate 30 minutes, rest 3 hours  :  940  rotations/day

  D:  rotate 1 hour, rest 3 hours  :  1700 rotations/day

I use setting B for my watch with ETA 2824 movement. Every watch has a specific requirement as of how many rotations per day it needs to remain fully wound. See you watch specifications.

The winder does not come with the possibillity to run on batteries, that is a pity I think.

As I just bought it I can not say anyting about long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps on running I think this i a very good buy.

So far I am very pleased with it!"
5.0,"I recently received the item and I love it. It is whisper quiet, works in both directions, and is automatic. I have seen other winders at 5x this price that don't do the same. Any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winder"
5.0,"Could not have gotten a better deal. It has been working for the last 2 months. Very quite, I leave it in the bedroom. Can't beat the price.

Recommended for those automatic watch lovers, you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model."
5.0,This was shipped immediately and arrived in good shape.  It works as advertised.  I have used it for about a month with no issues.
1.0,"I have owned two of the Garinin double watch winders.

The first lasted a week and had to be replaced. The second lasted less than two months. Rather than return it, I threw it out and decided to find a better product. AT $50, a good buy, but the two that I received did not work, even though I was careful follow all of the manufacturer's instructions."
4.0,"You need an automatic watch winder if you have more than one automatic watch.  This product is very adequate and relatively inexpensive.  I use it 24/7.  It keeps my watches wound so I don't have to reset every time I chose to switch the watch I am wearing.  You could pay more money and get better quality wood and interior fabric.  However this product is attractive, functional and practical.  It meets my needs and I am happy with the purchase."
5.0,"I'm very happy with this watch winder, its very quite. I've only had it for about a month now, no problems to report. I also like the multiple time and direction choices. Well worth the money if you don't mind a plastic winder."
4.0,"I would give this watch winder 8 stars but I have only had it a short time. If it keeps working the way it has,it will be the best winder I own at any price.(I own 3 winders at this time)"
5.0,I had searched the internet for days looking for an affordable watch winder. This little unit fit the bill perfectly.  I have had it for almost a month now and it is exactly what the manufacturer said it was.  I am a fan of BIG heavy watches and this little unit has kept my automatics perfectly wound and ready to wear.
5.0,This winder is very nice and worth every penny. Solid construction (plastic) and even has a magnetic door. The multitude of settings on this unit are only seen on super expensive winders. This winder can handle your Swiss and Japanese movements without issue. It has 2 motors instead of one (like most dual winders)although a single control.
4.0,"After nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away. The mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy.

The only critisism I have is lack of instructions to mount the watches. Maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band. Once I sorted that out - no problems"
4.0,"The product, as i recalled, cost about $36 for a double winder.  The product works quite well and is reasonably quiet.  If one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money--in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. This product is in the tens of dollars and works very well.  I am very happy with the product--as well as Amazon (dot) com."
5.0,owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one......
5.0,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I was really hoping that these potentially lethal (and euphemistically named) ""boot shapers"" would turn out to be at least as dangerous as described. I relished having one (or two, or all six) of these spring-loaded fashion bombs explode in my face, taking out an eye and allowing me to finally wear an eyepatch like my hero,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snake-Plissken/dp/B003O7I6L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snake Plissken</a>, without ridicule. I dreamed of making small talk with a beautiful ER nurse as she picked white plastic shrapnel from my face. I got a Chris Matthews-sized tingle up my leg as I anticipated the angry red welts that the metal bands would give me as they smacked my tender flesh.

Alas, even after inserting and removing these shapers numerous times in three separate pairs of engineer boots, I have been unable to get them to do anything but effectively and elegantly hold my boots' uppers in an upright position.

For my next pair of boots, I'm going to buy a pair of steel-jawed coyote traps. Or better yet, a family of live cobras."
5.0,"Very needed product for not only maintaining shape of boots, but easy storage in closets, rather than piled on top of each other!"
1.0,"I ordered two pairs of these boot shapers and within one month, one pair broke! (The metal piece that holds the two plastic sides together snapped out, and it won't go back in.) I'd return them but it seems like such a pain to wrap them up and mail. See if you can find a sturdier brand out there."
5.0,This is just what I was looking for. They work great. I was surprised to find they also hang. I love them and will order more!!!
1.0,"I purchased these boot shapers because the price seemed very good. As I should have predicted, you really do get what you pay for. The shapers are two pieces of pink plastic connected by two strips of metal. The strip of metal are curved and attached (in the most ineffective way you could ever imagine)to each piece of plastic. You are supposed to squeeze together to place into your boot and then release to maintain the shape of the boot. All of this is wonderful in theory, but the poor construction precludes easy use of the shaper without constantly having to reinsert the metal strips into the tiny little clips cut out for them in the plastic. This is a waste of time and, as some other users have noted, quite dangerous. I think you could seriously injure yourself with these if you got a flying strip of metal in the face as you're trying to put it into your boot. I put them into my boots facing away from me, but the metal strip still flies out and scares me 1 out of every 2 times I use it. Next time I will invest in something better constructed and less dangerous. To be clear, this is a problem with the product, not with the seller, who sent the package promptly and had everything nicely packaged for shipment."
5.0,Got these for my daughters selection of boots that were falling all over the place and collapsing at the ankles. Ignore the pink color - they're great and allow for easy vertical storage
1.0,"I'm surprised there is not a product recall on these things!  The metal
band flies out whether you ""hold the middle"" or not.  They are so poorly
made it's pathetic.  Don't bother buying these.  Look for Boot Trees that
are solid, or at a minimum, not a weapon!!"
5.0,"I purchased some awesome boots made with a really soft Italian leather that I didn't want to crease by just letting them flop in my closet.  I researched all the options for inexpensive, yet effective boot trees and chose Boot Shapers. PERFECT!!!  Easy to use if you compress them in the right spot and they hold my boots in perfect shape."
5.0,"This is a great invention!  Contrary to the other comment these are easy to operate if you have a little common sense... the spring-like action is in the center of the shaft of the boot shaper; therefore you should squeeze the whole thing together at that point while putting it in the boot... duh.
You just pop them in and your boots stand right up like they were on a mannequin... a great idea if you ask me.  They come with a hanger attached to the top loop of each boot shaper that stays hanging down but if you wanted to hang your boots up in your closet the hanger would come in very handy for that.
You really cannot beat the price either.  I hate it is not PRIME shipping available as I am a prime member but I have done business with shoebuy for years under Amazon and outside of Amazon and they are great.  Very fast and friendly.
You really cannot go wrong with these.  I would be nice if they offered more colors.  Hot pink is not really my style but who's going to see these things, right?
I am going to buy another set of 3 pair."
1.0,"These are horrible.  I tried putting the first one into a a boot three times and the metal strips popped out three times.  The long metal strips are what you are pushing together to put them in the boot, and they are supposed to provide the resistance to hold the boot in shape.  I stopped trying because I was afraid it would be hurt to get slapped with those metal strips with that kind of force.  Junk."
5.0,"So great I had to order more. I got all my boots organized and well shaped, they look brand new. The three-pair pack is a great deal."
5.0,Nice for my boots arrived on time and sturdy
5.0,Keeps boots upright and easy to clean shoe while shaper is in. I have bought many pairs and they have all lasted 10 years plus.
5.0,"The product works just as expected.
Not only keeps the boots' legs straight, but its capability of adjusting separately front and rear parts, which allows the front part to insert in the boots' shoes also keeps them from folding at ankle height.
Light weight, yet solid... great product!"
5.0,I am so in love wth my boot shapers! It's a better price to buy in bulk from amazon then to go to like bed bath and beyond. They are holding the shapes of my boots amazingly and I will repurchase more if I buy more boots!
5.0,I didn't realize they have a little hook to hang them as well...bonus! Plus they are super easy to use. Just squeeze and insert in the boot. Also just having them pink makes me happy:)
5.0,These things are seriously life savers. They are insanely durable and I don't really see how the metal part is dangerous at all.
5.0,"I invested in a couple of Frye boots and wanted to make sure that I did whatever was necessary to justify the expense.  So I purchased the weatherproof ""wax"" and leather ""honey"" to help with leather maintenance.  But, guess I should have realized that, after wearing them for a while, they stretch a bit and crease.  I have to say that these don't look like much, but they get the job done.  Now the boots don't sag and I can store them standing in the closet. Definitely worth the money spent."
5.0,Just what I expected and more.  Quality will hold up for years and I look forward to buying more if I need to.
5.0,"I have six sets  of these bought a year ago, and 3 I just received right now.  The old ones are the menace described in many other reviews.  The metal bands that were supposed to stay clipped into each of the plastic sides (which provides the pressure to make them actually shape the boots) did not stay clipped - they spring out on 3 of the 6 OLD pairs.  But, the new ones have a much better system - the metal bands have a very solid latch onto the plastic sides.  Very, very pleased with the new design."
5.0,I have really enjoyed my boot shapers. The ones that I got were pink. The shaper part is a hard plastic material. Only thing is be careful inserting the shapers since it has a metal piece and I have read that sometimes it can snap back at you. Mine have not done that yet.
5.0,These boot shapers work great and are not difficult to use - just slip them into your boots and the boots stand by themselves. They can be hung from a closet bar but even when the boots are standing on the floor the boot shapers hold the boots upright keeping them clean and shapely.
5.0,"Okay I just got these and slipped them right into my boots and they are keeping the shape.  I don't think this was hard at all to figure out.  I love them, plus they are a great value! I'm definitely going to buy another pack of three. They even come with a little hanger if you have hanging space in a huge closet (I don't have that luxury right now).  Great product, great value, easy breezy!"
4.0,I love that my boots are no longer leaning to the side and laying on top of one another.  I bought enough for all my tall boots and the small size for my ankle boots.
5.0,"I was searching for boot shapers just so my closet wasn't piled high with boots that always flopped over, taking up more space than what I was ok with giving up.
These are so simple, and so effective they are a no brainer. I bought several packages .. and now all of my boots are standing tall and in a tidy row. Best of all the price is right!"
5.0,"I received these yesterday and immediately put them in my boots.  They work perfectly.  A little trouble getting them in because you have to squeeze to put them in.  But for the boots with zippers, I unzipped them, put the trees all the way down and then held the boot together and zipped - PERFECT.  Now my leather boots won't get creased!!"
5.0,"This product is light weight, easy to insert into the boot, keeps the boot in shape, and has a hook to allow you to hang your boots off the floor if desired. No down side to this product."
4.0,"Keeps my boots standing up straight and tall in the closet. However, I hope it doesn't stretch out the leather. Will report back."
5.0,These boot shapers are easy to use.  They are just what I wanted to keep my boots in nice shape.
5.0,"Recently, I purchased one pair of Boot Shapers at a big bed and bath store and loved them; but at $10 a pop, I knew this could get pricey buying 10+ pairs (and I didn't want to buy them one at a time with the 20% off store coupon).  I had been using rolled up newspapers, after awhile they get broken down and need to be replaced. I really love these.  They are simple to use and look great in white. Not only do they keep all heights of boots (from booties to thigh highs) up straight, the way they are made, allows for air to circulate all the way down to the toe area.  Without these, the boots fold over and there is no way for air to get down inside and freshen them up, definitely beats my primitive newspaper option.  Also, there is the cleaver alternative to hang them with the attached hook. Love this company, my package was received before the seller's earliest anticipated delivery date. These Boot Shapers are awesome, you'll regret it later if you don't buy more than the one pack of three."
4.0,"Being able to stand up my boots or hang them is such a convenience while keeping their shape. One of the hanger hooks broke, so I just switched it out for another in the set. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I am ordering more of these today, and was suprised to see negative reviews. So- I felt compelled to give them some positive feedback! I have never been pinched or attacked or had any other bad experience with these shapers.  On the contrary- I LOVE them.

I simply squeeze them when I put them into my boots, and then pull the hanger to get them out.  They have been very simple for me to use.

Thanks"
5.0,"Boot shapers are easy to use and keep my boots upright!  This helps to keep the closet neat, but also protects leather boots from creasing when they flop over!"
5.0,I bought some really nice tall boots over the winter and wanted to keep them that way.  For the price these are really a good buy.  They are very sturdy and work great at keeping the boot upright.
5.0,My sister asked for these for a stocking stuffer for Christmas... so I bought them for everyone including myself.  The only comment I have is.... why didn't I get these sooner?  My closet looks great and it makes conditioning tall boots (including riding boots) MUCH easier!
5.0,I read the reviews on this and don't have ANY of the problems noted.  They are simple to put into a boot and then hold them up perfectly.  If you try to fuss with them too much I guess they could cause problems....but I haven't had an issues myself.
4.0,"I bought these to use with the boot rack and it works great. The only problem I have is that the hanger faces the wrong way, and if you turn the boot shaper so it faces the correct way, the boots are not shaped correctly. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, it still works great on the boot rack since the hanger is a flexible plastic. I worry that the plastic may eventually break since I have to twist it to the correct direction to hang it on the boot rack. I also bought the boot bags (from Bootique) but 2 of the 6 bags had broken zippers and it was a struggle getting my boots into the bags so I would not recommend buying the boot bags."
5.0,"I had been looking for this item for several years.  Bought two sets, and they work great.  Highly recommend for anyone with tall boots."
1.0,"These are so poorly made and didn't last a minute. Upon putting the first boot shaper in my boot, I thought these were easy to use and shrugged off the previously reported defects. After attempting to insert the second and third shaper and watching each one shatter, I changed my mind!  Very poor quality."
5.0,"I purchased 6 pairs for the wife who has too many boots, shoes, clothes, etc...  They are made of plastic and the inner tension rod is made of metal.  The rod has enough resistance that the boot is sturdily held upright perfectly.  To place inside the boot you simply squeeze the shapers while pushing them down into the boot.  They may be a little difficult to insert at first but with a little practice it becomes easier.  A hook is also included which allows the boots to be hung from a closet rod; very nice indeed.  The wife loves them so I can't complain."
3.0,"The presentation of this shirt on the website led me to believe that it had french cuffs. It did not.  However since I needed it within a particular time period I had to use it.  The price was fair and the quality is okay. The shirtfront, along with the studs that were included also has buttons. I removed them because they made a slight bulge in the shirtfront with the studs installed."
5.0,"This is a very nice looking shirt for the price.  It arrived quickly.  And even though the sizes are not exact - depending on your neck size they will select S,M,L,XL along with the correct sleeve length - it still was a decent fit."
3.0,"After passing over many cheap tux shirts that were offered in size S/M/L/XL/2XL available on the internet, I chose to take a chance on this one, because the web page offered actual size selections based on neck size and sleeve length.  I need a 16-1/2 35 shirt, which falls somewhere between L and XL.  L is too small and XL is too big.  I was very disappointed when they sent me this shirt in size L.  I contacted the seller and they explained that this shirt is not available by neck size like they advertised.  They look at the size you order, and send you the size they think is the best approximation of what you ordered.  Had I known this up front, I never would have placed the order.  I returned the shirt and received a full refund, but I got stuck for the return shipping.  I think the size selection on the web page is very misleading."
4.0,I was surprised at the quality of the shirt. I halfway expected to get something with scratchy material that looked as cheap as the shirt was. The shirt is comparable to those I have seen in other stores for 2 or 3 times as much...Good buy. I will use them again.
5.0,"As the title says, I needed a tuxedo shirt the week before my friend's wedding.  It was a formal wedding and I was unable to go shopping due to time commitments for work and work functions.  I ordered this shirt and accidentally asked for standard shipping.  Well this shirt was shipped same day and it arrived 2 days later.  The shirt was great for the price and the service was even better."
4.0,"This Tuxedo Shirt with Pintuck (pleat) and Laydown Collar with Convertable Front and Cuff was a sure thing for me as any Tuxedo Product by Neil Allyn is always top drawer. I had previously ordered the Neil Allyn - Wing or Stand-up Collar Tuxedo Shirt with 1/4"" Pleat and it was better than any other Manufactured Tuxedo Shirt that I have ever owned before.  The only problem I had with this Vendor is the Delivey Time was 10 days due to a late shipment and if I had received in 11 days it would have been to late for the Formal I was attending (ordered a Vest and Tie from this Vendor and it was shipped by a Sub-Vendor immediately via the same mail system and I received it in 3 days!!"
3.0,No Comment.
5.0,I like the way the shirt fit. Being that I am a taller Guy my shirt fit as if were tailored just for me. Thanks for such a great product. It getting harder and harder to find what you are actually looking for nowadays. I will shop here again..
1.0,Way too big
5.0,"The pleats are crisp, the shirt is comfortable, and it looked fantastic under my tuxedo jacket. It comes with plastic studs to look good in the package. Remove them to use your own, or use the buttons like a regular shirt. The cuffs require cufflinks. The collar button is on a short elastic so it has a small amount of stretch to it.

I just returned from a 15 day cruise and there were 3 formal nights. On the first night, the shirt fit fine. Half way through the cruise on the second formal night, the shirt collar was feeling tight. On the 14th night, and final formal night, I left the collar button undone and used my bowtie to keep the collar closed. Did you know that shirts didn't originally have collar buttons and ties were used to hold the shirt closed on the top? I paid homage to history to compensate for the shrinking collar (which might have had something to do with all the extra eating I did)."
4.0,as described
1.0,Horrible fit. Extremely boxy and baggy fit. Not Slim fit at all. I'm a size 38 athletic build and purchased a (15 X 32-33) and (15.5 X 32-33) and it fit like a size 48.
1.0,Washed and the fabric did not hold up.  Had to throw away after he wearing.
5.0,Fix perfectly
4.0,Arms on this shirt are very large around bicep area.
3.0,Quality good but that size should have fit and it was too large
4.0,"This shirt was a solid OK, good for the price. My fiance's narrow shoulders didn't fit quite that well, but I'd say someone with more average shoulders would have been fine.

The shirting material was thinner, so the pleated front was very, very pronounced comparatively. We were not fans personally, but in fairness the issue would probably be minimized with a white undershirt.

Construction was nice and crisp, the pleats were sized well and uniform however, so I would still recommend for those looking in this price range."
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,Very nice shirt....I am not a fan of bow ties being a taller dude....but it will fit your purposes.
5.0,great shirt at great price. Fits just right and is very comfy
1.0,"I am not at all pleased with the quality of this shirt, especially the cuffs which are some kind of weird not French but not regular either. Honestly, it is something you would expect to come with some sort of tacky costume"
5.0,as expected fit
4.0,Yes
5.0,"Fits perfectly, great price and quick delivery"
3.0,The shirt fit in the collar but was huge.  A very nice shirt otherwise.  I just tucked it in and hid it with a the jacket.
5.0,"Right price, fast service, follow up email with exchange instructions. Excellent."
5.0,"Great shirt at a great price.  Liked the studs that are included, too."
4.0,Just fine ...it is classy.
5.0,very good quality
3.0,This tuxedo shirt would have been great - especially for the low price - except for the fact that it does not have french cuffs.  The cuffs on the shirt are regular dress shirt cuffs which are not appropriate for a tuxedo shirt and not disclosed in the description.  Disappointed.
5.0,FINALLY A  NECK SIZE THAT FITS.
5.0,i ordered one size smaller than normal and it fit great
5.0,Great value and quality. Black buttons are included.
4.0,"Pros: Comfortable. Finally have a tux shirt that doesn't require me to constantly pull on the cuffs or neckline.
Cons: fabric a little thinner than expected, but that may prove helpful in warm situations."
2.0,"This item is being returned for being extremely too large.  The sleeves are so wide I could fit my fist in it after buttoning it, and the chest could be double breasted there's that much extra there.  The shirt does say the correct measurements as all my other buttondowns, but also has an ""L"" on it.  That gives credence to the other reviewers who say they just have small, medium, and large sizes and not actually exact shirt sizes.  A shame, because A. it was for an event the next day, so I couldn't wear it, and I liked how it came with studs."
5.0,"Excellent quality, great fit, nice value"
4.0,"Nice cut, good quality."
5.0,comfortable and looks good
2.0,advertised as fitted but very loose. material flimsy.
5.0,"Nice price, typical budget Tux shirt"
5.0,Needed in 5 days. Arrived in two. Was exact sleeve length. Fit perfect.
2.0,"Not a good value. I opened up the shirt and was surprised to find that this tuxedo shirt doesnt have sleeve plackets. Good shirts have sleeve plackets - cheap shirts do not. It also had buttons on the cuffs instead of French cuffs! This really means its cheap but I am sure a high school prom guy wouldnt mind. I returned it. If you have pride in your appearance and know that people will look at your clothes closely then I cant recommend this shirt, sorry."
5.0,Was really suitable for the dance costume.
4.0,"Great shirt, great value"
3.0,The shirt looks nice and fabric is fine.  What I found to be a problem is that it lead me to believe that I could chose specific neck size and that is not the case.  I asked for a 16 and what I got was larger-more like 16 1/2.  I can wear it but it isn't the size that I asked for. This should be made clearer when ordering the shirt-that is covers more than one neck size.
5.0,"This shirt is a bargain! Comfortable fabric, excellent sleeve length and neck size.
Sure you could spend more but why??"
5.0,"For the price, this is an amazing shirt. I bought one for my son that was too big, but fit my husband. Bought another for my son. They both looked great."
5.0,Was good quality and got perfectly. We ordered a 16 collar in 32/33 sleeve. Was excellent
1.0,I ordered an 18 neck size and this is at least a 19.  Arms excessively long.  Way too large.
5.0,One of the least expensive nice which tux shirts for my son's band concert.  Very pleased.
5.0,Looks great on.
5.0,"It would be hard to be more pleased.  The quality is much better than the two, similarly priced shirts that the new shirts replaced. I would definitely buy more of these if the need arises."
5.0,Good quality and looked great.
5.0,"Had to get a few sizes to figure out what we needed, but it ended up being true to size.  Had to replace my husband's tuxedo shirt and  didn't want to spend a fortune.  Very good shirt for the price.  Not sure how it will wash, but still better than paying 75.00 for a shirt he only wears once a year."
5.0,"Really like the black formal buttons and the pleats on the front of the shirt give a fashionable and formal look. The fabric is easy care. I compared to other much more expensive shirts - I anticipate not wearing it often, but it is excellent quality and fit."
4.0,Wanted a size 16 got a large but I will be use it
5.0,A really nice fit and comfortable too.
5.0,I would buy this shirt again...and I might!!!
5.0,Good product priced right and fast delivery. Thank you
4.0,"Was very large but I have muscular build, so my waist is smaller than my back and shoulders."
5.0,better than expected
4.0,Nice fit
5.0,"Shirt fits my husband perfectly.  It's often difficult to fit him as he works out and has a big neck, large arms and a very big  chest.  I have already washed the shirt, as directed, and it needs no ironing.  Thanks."
5.0,Great shirt!
4.0,Looked great.
5.0,Neil Allyn Mens Tuxedo Shirt Poly/Cotton Laydown...work for event...
4.0,"Surprisingly good quality for a partially polyester shirt.  The material wasn't as lightweight ""see through"" as I was afraid that it would be.  The fit was very much in line with American standard sizing.  The pleats were sewn evenly, and perhaps more importantly, straight.  The button holes all have provisions for studs and cufflinks.  Overall, good value for nice-llooking formal wear."
5.0,Ok as purchased
4.0,"The fabric is very thin and  it is wide in the waist, but a nice shirt for the money and makes a nice shirt for hot summer nights."
2.0,"Way to big, ordered two for my son for work, same size, two different companies. He was ""swimming"" this one. the other one fit perfectly. Arrived in time, nice product otherwise."
3.0,"Good texture, however, neck size is not posted resulting little too large as to compare to the sleeve length.

Cuff portion on the sleeve should be more firm, this one has a loose end so does not hold cuffs too well.

Otherwise  light fabric, and stylish.."
5.0,Excellent shirt fits great
4.0,good
5.0,"Shirt is a full cut! I was worried about buying a shirt online and fitting to tight. I normally wear a 17-1/2, but I ordered a size 18 to be on the safe side incase the shirt was cut small, but I could have used a 17-1/2. But shirt quality was excellent for the price!"
5.0,great shirt
5.0,"Very nice shirt, fits as expected. Made a nice appearance."
5.0,Excellent.
5.0,"well made, feels good stays sharp"
5.0,"Received it on schedule as promised, fits as expected, ironed up nicely and looked really sharp on.  I especially like the black buttons."
5.0,Just wore it for the first time. Very good quality and appearance. The price was great.
4.0,"The shirt is a little tight around my stomach even though I have purchased shirts of the same size in the past, and they fit comfortably. Otherwise, it is a very nice shirt."
4.0,"A little boxy in the trunk but the pleats, collar and cuffs are perfect."
4.0,Nice shirt for the price.  Wasn't able to find proper size in store but you carried it.  Better quality than I expected.  My Husband liked the feel and the fit was perfect.
2.0,"The quality level of this shirt did not meet expectations.  Numerous construction flaws, in nearly every aspect of the shirt.  I returned it and purchased the 100% cotton version, with french cuffs, also by Neil Allyn.  Now this shirt is what I was expecting.  For just a little more money, the 100% cotton shirt is made well and fit perfectly.  I highly recommend you avoid the poly/cotton shirt and get the 100% cotton version, even if you only think you will wear it once!  It is worth it."
3.0,"A little baggy, but it did it's job in a pinch."
5.0,"19.5"" neck was just perfect . The shirt looks to be and feels nice. I had my Taylor take in the other parts do to neck."
3.0,"Picture misleading , dies NOT come with the biw tie! Very frustrated. Shirt length was way to long for a man 5ft 11inch with a 19 n 1/2 inch neck. Overall happy we got it ontime and my husband looked sharp !"
5.0,great shirt
5.0,On time and as ordered. Thanks. My 1980''s themed prom went great.
5.0,These fit perfectly.  Very well made.
3.0,"shirt was advertised as ""15.5 - 34-35.""  When received, I tried it on and found neck was too large.  Upon reading neck label, discovered neck size was listed as {medium.)  I sent it back."
5.0,"We were particularly looking for a larger shirt for my father. I picked this shirt based on the reviews that advised it runs larger.
Great for fuller men, great quality."
4.0,Have purchased from the same manufacturer before and they have worn very well.
4.0,"Fti my needs, basic pleated poly/cotton tuxedo shirt.  Stretch comfort collar button nice touch.  Would buy again."
5.0,Great shirt.  A replacement for my old one.
5.0,Love it
4.0,"I've been wearing this brand of tuxedo shirt for a number of years, and it is a well-made piece of clothing.  My only comment that I'd like to make is that, in order to receive the neck in the proper size, I have to order an XL -- for which the rest of the shirt is not fitted at all (and is quite large).  To remedy this, it means a trip to the tailor to have a couple of darts placed in the back."
4.0,Material and look are good. The fit is way bigger than other brands. I usually wear a 17 around my neck and it is a nice fit. This shirt in 17 was about 3/4 of an inch too big. I should have bought 16.5.
5.0,good shirt
2.0,"Fit is as expected.  Quality is somewhat disappointing.  Material in the sleeves and back is very thin and shear.  You can basically see through it.  Also, the cuffs are very basic, like a regular long sleeve shirt.  They are not the fold over cuffs.  Would not recommend this shirt."
5.0,"The neck was a little larger than expected, bit shipped fast and was a nice match with my jacket. Great shirt!!"
4.0,"Thin material, but looked fine with a white tshirt underneath it.  Was expecting something a little more substantial I guess."
5.0,perfect fit
5.0,"Quite decent tuxedo shirt.  Fits well, material is good.  It will work well for the purpose."
5.0,Fits great.
5.0,this shirt for the price was an excellent purchas.
5.0,"Awesome shirt, fits as expected.
A little on the large side but maybe that's because I have a large neck and need a large shirt, all good."
1.0,"There are many types of fit. Slim fit, regular fit, but this shirt is awkward fit!! Wide sleeves, extra wide in shoulders and small neck. Try to get larger size? You will get the same proprions but larger. Good luck looking like scare crow!"
5.0,This was a great buy. Fits as expected and was top notch value. I had a good coat already and didn't want to spend much on a shirt since it's mostly covered up. This really hit the spot. Once the whole suit was together it looked supreme. Product Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G01UDA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5
5.0,Perfect for the wedding I attended. Good quality washed and ironed well.
4.0,Very nice shirt.  Fits exactly as expected.  Does the trick for the occasion.
4.0,Great for the price. Fabric somewhat light but still a very nice shirt. Good fit.
5.0,Very nice dress shirt!  Looks very classy and stylish when worn with a tuxedo.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it to others.
5.0,It was a great tuxedo shirt for a great price
2.0,Sized way to small a xl fit like a medium
3.0,The shirt is HUGE. I bought the size I normally wear and it is a lot bigger. Great quality though.
4.0,sharp looking and all day comfortable...great...would buy again
5.0,"Nice item, was super happy with my purchase!"
3.0,Looks a little cheap...
4.0,"Very nice shirt, but waaayyy too big. Sleeve lenght was good but neck and chest were way too big."
5.0,Very good quality shirt for the price. Love the stretchable collar button mechanism. Definitely would recommend as great buy! Mine came with studs installed.
5.0,I have never looked so good in my online dating profile!
5.0,"Great shirt, especially at this price point. The fabric is somewhat sheer but the shirt is well made. I really appreciate that the top button is sewn to elastic! Much more comfortable around the neck."
2.0,"She shirt is a great price, but was very large on my fiance. He wears an 18.5 neck, 34-35 sleeve normally but this selection was FAR too large for him. It's a good price, though."
4.0,Great
5.0,"About one-half inch too large, would like to return the second shirt for smaller size or refund.  Please advise. Thank you delivery was as promised!"
4.0,Perfect fit
4.0,Nice shirt...i should have gotten 1 size smaller.
5.0,Very nice
5.0,"Fit perfect, looked great and arrived on time.  Loved the stretch top button."
5.0,Elegant
4.0,"Had an awards dinner, shirt came in good time, fits good."
5.0,Great value ...fits and looks great
4.0,"It fit great, my boyfriend isn't too picky so as long as it wasn't itchy he is golden. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was see through."
5.0,Great price and fits perfectly
4.0,"I wore this shirt casually (without a tie and top button open) and this shirt fit me well. I have an athletic build so it was a little loose on the waist and stomach area, but that's to be expected from a shirt that isn't a slim fit design.

My neck size is between a 15 1/2 & 16 and I ordered the 15 1/2 neck size. This dropped me into a Medium size shirt as opposed to a Large (which would have been way too big). The collar button extends a bit and when I tried it, I was still able to close the shirt comfortably. My advice is if you're on the border of 2 neck sizes, go with the smaller neck size, because the shirts come in a size S,M,L etc., with the appropriate arm length."
5.0,"Perfect for me. Maybe a bit roomy, but I never remove my tux jacket. I'm 5' 8"" and 188lbs. Recommended."
1.0,Arrived in adequate time but was much too big.  Had to go out and buy another shirt that fit me for the event.
4.0,"Good shirt for the price.  Pintuck pleats are nicely stitched.  Fabric is not particularly heavy, but not bad."
5.0,As expected
2.0,"I ordered my exact neck size 17""and sleeve length 34-35.  The shirt arrived in a plastic wrapper clearly marked 17"" / 34-35"".  However sewn inside the shirt was a label reading simply XL.  I tried on the shirt and the circumference of the neck was way too large.  Curious, I measured it with a tailors tape and it was a size 18.  Disappointed, I had to return the shirt."
4.0,Great product fast delivery
5.0,"Ordered as 16.5 34-35. Received a Large 34-35 which fit perfectly. Neck button is expandable, but I didn't need it. I'm somewhat out of shape and a 42 waist but there is room across the chest, at the waist, and under the arms. The shirt comes with perfect looking black plastic studs-you can use them, or your own, or the buttons and buttonholes built into the shirt(invisible if you use studs). The cuffs are button only. The pleated front and collar are perfect, as in the picture. As some people reported, the body of the shirt that is invisible under the jacket is somewhat light/see-thru but the fabric is strong. I wore a white teeshirt under the shirt which allowed me to take off my jacket when things got late and informal and I looked perfectly acceptable. I wore this to a high-end event at the Arizona Biltmore which is as sophisticated as it gets and looked as good as anyone (I have a portrait photo made at the event). I recommend the shirt without reservations."
3.0,Good tux shirt for a waiter. No so much for a ball.
5.0,Everything one can expect in a tuxedo shirt and arrived as promised. Who could ask for anything more?!
5.0,"My husband is a big man, and this tux fit perfectly!!"
4.0,Very nice tuxedo shirt. Used by my son for concert band.
4.0,"This is not something to wear to the Academy Awards, but it's perfect for that one-time wedding use or the annual holiday party. The material is not robust, but not tissue thin like others and is comfortable even on a warm summer day. The pleats held up through washing and it took an ironing well. No complaints really."
4.0,Good price and quality.
1.0,"Designed for fat American men.  You need to offer tapered shirts like European stores have.  The shirt is size 16, but it's made for someone with a size 42 waist or maybe larger.  My waist size is 33."
5.0,Shirt is great!!
4.0,Would have preferred in Wing Collar...
5.0,Nice shirt and a perfect fit!  I've already purchased two since they fit so well.
5.0,"Great texture, fit quite well"
2.0,poor quality
4.0,Showed up on time.  Fits great.
5.0,Very nice shirt. Fit well. Confusing because the picture shows a bow tie on the shirt but it doesn't come with the tie.
4.0,As expected.  Would order from them again.
5.0,The shirt fit good .Was ship on time I was very happy.
5.0,Excellent buy. Good fit. Excellent quality. Shipped ontime. It is everything as was stated.
5.0,Excellent fit
3.0,The sleeves are too long
4.0,works for my husband
4.0,nice shirt but it's a little bigger than my others of same sizing.
4.0,Great value!
5.0,Excellent quality
5.0,"We kept this shirt, since we bought another type as well. It looks great and wears well."
4.0,The shirt fit great. Material was a little thin. If you are wearing with undershirt and jacket it will work fine. We bought this shirt with the understanding that it would worn a handful of times before he outgrows it.
5.0,Great shirt.
5.0,Excellent Quality!
4.0,nice shirt
4.0,A little larger then i was expecting. But a pretty nice shirt
3.0,The cuffs are not true double french cuffs
1.0,No stars. Fits way too small returned to vendor. Had to pay for shipping almost as much as I payed for shirt.
4.0,Nice shirt.
3.0,I ordered size 17 neck and 32 sleeve which ways one of the size selections. I received a size extra large. The shirt is nice and roomy. It works for what I need it for.
5.0,nice to be able to get a shirt with choice of shorter sleeves.
2.0,"Neck size fine, shirt is to large, very thin poor quality material
Robert"
2.0,The shirt fits good however the material has flaws in it. 4 different areas have a flaw or a small dark thread woven into the material. Will not buy another one of these shirts under this label.
4.0,No problems!
1.0,Very good
5.0,Brand new and fits great!
5.0,Quite a nice shirt.
5.0,Perfect fit on time arrival
5.0,I'm amazed at how nice a shirt this is for so little money. Our local formal wear shop wanted over $100 for similar 60/40 blend tuxedo shirt. I especially like the buttons and button holes that allow use of studs and cufflinks when desired.
4.0,Great shirts from this company.  Always top quality.
3.0,Neck was too big
5.0,"Nice and soft, feels great and looks great. Great feature with top button, it stretches."
5.0,perfect fit.
4.0,For the price a nice shirt. It did not need ironing after washing.
5.0,inexpensive but great Tux addition.
5.0,Fits great. Just what I wanted.
5.0,Worked out great
3.0,Shirt was about 4 inches too long and huge.
5.0,Fit as stated on the size for the shirt. Going on my second year of using it with my tux.
5.0,Fit well. Delivered on time. Nice shirt.
5.0,"I was a little skeptical at first purchasing formal wear online without being able to try it on or touch it.  I can say that my skepticism went right out the window as soon as I received this shirt. High quality fabric, the fit is perfect, the neckline was my main concern, but it fits as though it was tailored just for me.  I have already told a few friends about it.  Really love this shirt and the price isn't bad either."
5.0,"My husband has to go to many black tie optional and black tie events for work throughout the year.  We finally sprung for a tux and I was looking for a formal shirt that was nice, yet not crazy expensive.  This one fit the bill.  I was not expecting much due to some of the reviews but the most recent reviews looked positive so I ordered. On Amazon, I always go by the most recent reviews because that carries more weight to me than one from 2009 or so.  My husband  is  5'8, 42 inch waist and wears a 20 neck 34/35 sleeve, so I chose the 20 34/35 on Amazon as the option.  When took it out of the package, this shirts tag just says ""4X' on the inside (but their sticker on the onside of the package said 20, 34/35). He tried it on and everything was perfect but the neck was a little large (before adding a tie). Just a little bigger than he liked, leaving a little gap.  However, sleeves, belly area, everything fit PERFECT besides the neck being a little too large.  So, I washed the shirt in hot water and put it in the dryer and the neck is now absolutely perfect. Fits him 100% now.  The shirt looks great and fits like a dream.  The quality is great for the price.  Also, I took the advice of another review and bought these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cufflinks-and-Studs-Set-for-Tuxedo-Formal-Black-with-Shiny-Silver-Trimming-by-Men-s-Collections/dp/B004NKD3J8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cufflinks and Studs Set for Tuxedo - Formal Black with Shiny Silver Trimming by Men's Collections</a>&nbsp;button studs and cufflinks.  The button studs that come with the shirt are very cheap plastic and on the small side (as you'd expect for free) and you could get away with them for a one time event like a wedding or formal event, but if you will wear the shirt over and over I'd go for nicer studs. Also, I had no quality control issues.  All the stitching is just fine -- the shirt was not thin as one review said. We are very pleased. This was a FAR better buy then going to big and tall shops here all over town looking for a tux shirt that would #1 would fit and #2, still spending $75 or $100 on it locally."
1.0,Horrible quality. Material is so this you can see you skin through the shirt.
5.0,"I wore this for a home event recently, and everyone said that I looked sharp in my tuxedo!"
1.0,The quality of the shirt is rather good but the sizing is way off. I read this comment from other reviews but decided to take a chance as there were sufficient positive reviews to substantiate making the purchase. This is something which I believe the seller can easily correct. It was a bit frustrating to have to go through the process of doing the return and having to go out and look for another shirt at the mall.
4.0,fit great and looked very nice with a tux.  is not worn alot but even once or twice a year the price was great.
5.0,This is a Great shirt with very Good quality. Great fit. It Arrived at the perfect time for a formal function.
4.0,I purchased this short notice for a wedding and got it promptly.  The fit and quality was good.  No complaints.
3.0,"Shirt is bit baggier than I expected. I would look for a slim fit in the future, but other than this the shirt is good."
5.0,I needed a formal shirt with a down turned pointed collar.  Found this one on Amazon and ordered it.  It arrived promptly and fits just right.  Material is good quality and just what I wanted.
1.0,"fit well, but one of the sleeves wasn't sewn on (stiching missed the fabric).  Good thing we decided to iron a few weeks prior to the event.  Apparently you get what you pay for."
5.0,"Although the shirt is a poly cotton blend, it does not look like a cheap shirt and looks really great."
5.0,Just perfect with the tux I bought and beautifully made and looks so elegant -- my hubby was GORGEOUS to the point of my tears.
4.0,"After reading some other reviews, I was concerned.. so as soon as I received it, I unwraped and tried it on.  It fit very good, the neck size was just right, and the sleeve length was perfect.  I was very pleasantly surprised and happy with the purchase so far."
5.0,Shirt fits well and I'll probably buy at least one more.  It's also has very comfortable collar compared to my previous tux dress shirt of the same size.
1.0,The Neil Allyn Tux Shirt fit OK but the workmanship was shoddy and fabric felt cheap. Quality control was AWOL.
5.0,"I wear this shirt on formal nights on a cruise ship.  The pleated front is classy.  The price was good and the fit was just fine.  I don't need to iron it, if I get it out of the washer quickly and dry it on the permanent press cycle it looks good enough thanks to the Poly/Cotton blend material."
2.0,"The body of the shirt was somewhat too wide.
I'll probably find a friend to pass it on to - not sure how to return it."
2.0,I like a more slim fit so I did not like the fit of it.  The shirt studs are cheap plastic so I would recommend buying some nice studs for the shirt if you want to use them. I ended up returned the shirt because one of the regular shirt buttons (not stud) was broken in half. No problems with the return.
5.0,"Bought a few non-Neil Allyn shirts before...MISTAKE! Stick with the best! As inexpensive - yeah, under $50 is inexpensive for a tux shirt - tux shirts go, Neil Allyn is the standard. I have the wing-tip and this arrow-collar version. Both fit the same. XXL 35...perfect for me. I'm pushing a 48/50 chest at this point, so... the XL is not quite there. 35 fits my just under 35 arms perfectly. There's good room - it's NOT a trim fit..it's comfortable. The shirt lays well and looks great. Button holes are slightly under-cut, so you may have to press to put studs in, but otherwise, it's made well and holds up to the workouts."
5.0,There was nothing wrong with the shirt it 2 sizes too large due to my weight-loss. I reordered a 18.5. 34/35 it's a perfect fit.  Due to many singing engagements I use six to eight shirts a year. A first time ordering online and what shop in getting the shirt in four days. Superb styling with impeccable quality.
2.0,"After getting proper measurements, I spent hours shopping and trying on various shirts that were available in nearby stores. When that came up short, I went to Amazon and other online stores and began my research based on availability, quality, reviews, and value for money. I was confident when I ordered this shirt. However, when it arrived, the neck size was perfect but the arm length was off and the body of this shirt was HUGE! As another reviewer stated, ""I was swimming in it."" I did not expect it to be tailored but I expected better quality than what was received. I should have given more attention to the one review that said ""they look at the size you order and send you the best approximation of what you ordered."" I have since purchased a better quality shirt at another store I found. I had to spend a bit more money but bottom line is you get what you pay for. I can't work with generic sizing. Shirts like these need to be exact. This shirt is going back."
1.0,"I got my measurements from a Men's Warehouse prior to buying this shirt and I felt confident in making a purchase using their figures.  When this shirt arrived, I was frankly swimming in it.  The piping on the arms was atrocious and the length of the shirt was about mid thigh."
3.0,"I ordered a size 15 32/33 and received a size ""medium"". The shirt is high quality and obviously well made. It fits well except for the collar size which is I/2 size too large. The sizing issue should have been indicated in the advertising."
4.0,"Shirt was of good quality for the price. I purchased the 14 X 30-31 size as a 140lb 5'8"" athletic build and the shirt was somewhat large but still a good fit for not being advertised as slim fit."
5.0,"The shirt was very good, met all expectaions, look good, fit good, felt good.  Have nothing but good things to say.  Thank Yout"
5.0,"My husband and I really looked around for good Tuxedo shirts at a decent price.  When I saw this one on Amazon, I thought it was worth a try because the price was so good and it was easy to order my husbands size.  It is a very nice shirt.  My husband has trouble with his neck being large and this shirt came in his neck size and also it has a piece of elastic at the neck that will expand for comfort.  Very nice looking shirt.  Fits a bit larger than shirts that size he normally wears, but it does fine.  I would recommend this shirt to any of my friends."
4.0,"I ordered by neck size, what was sent was x size and they do not come close to being the same. The shirt was of good quality,but the size was wrong."
5.0,I paid very little for this shirt and was expecting a cheap low quality shirt but was surprised at what I got.  would recommend this over any top quality shirt.
2.0,"The shirt is thin and poorly made. And as another reviewer pointed out the neck size is only used to determine if they are going to send you a small, medium or large shirt. Do yourself a favor and splurge a bit and go to The Men's Wearhouse Macy's and get yourself a quality formal shirt."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. This shirt is usable, thin material and OK. The button holes were frayed but for the price, not a bad buy."
2.0,"I purchased this item and received it with a few blood stains from manufacture. Looks like when the ""floor personnel"" were assembling the shirt with the ""bobby pins"" the blood stains marked on the shirt. YES kinda yuck but shirt quality was good and shipping was fast.  The OTHER IMPORTANT thing is that I am 5'9"" and 160LBs and usually run as 32-33 with 15.5 or 16"" neck. WELL this shirt runs HUGE so I would recommend Medium I had the Large cause I ordered 16 as neck so automatically ran to the LARGE dept.  Hope this helps......  I am not a product hater but this time was pure bad luck with my order. :S"
5.0,"perfect for the occassion, and it traveled well.  Looked good and was just as described. He looked good in it and I may use it for a night shirt."
3.0,I was really surprised that the bowtie did NOT come with the shirt. For the price I paid I wasn't really mad about it.
5.0,"I needed this shirt for work on a fine dining dinner boat. It was exactly what I needed, and has served me well for almost a year now. I find the material to be of good quality, but almost 1/2 the price of Men's Warehouse."
1.0,"Item was as stated, and of good quality.
However, the size shipped was not correct. Tried to contact vendor, by email and phone to exchange or return my purchase but received no response.
Now I am stuck with a shirt I can't wear."
5.0,This shirt washed nicely and fit well.  No problems with size of neck.  We needed a 16 1/2 neck and ordered a large shirt and it was perfect.
5.0,"This is a shirt my husband ordered.  It wears & washes well, and he's very pleased with it.  Good value for the money, as these shirts are very hard to get..."
5.0,This shirt looks very nice and fits well. It is an excellent buy. The same shirt is twice as much in a department store!
4.0,"Great quality slacks, I love the fit, length, sturdiness, etc.  Too bad Carhartt changed the front leg velcro-ed pockets.  They used to be full cut velcro across the top -- easily to slip my mobile or a pad into.  Now the pocket is a weird slanted-3/4-cut velcro, and it's trickier to slip my mobile, etc into.  Maybe more resistant to being nicked, but I preferred the older style.  Still a terrific slack, and my favorite."
5.0,My husband is very happy with the comfort and practicality of these pants.  I am happy that they wash well and they look good on him.
5.0,"After brand jumping for years, I've settled on Carhartt for everything I wear. My only regret is that I don't live in a colder climate to wear their winter outdoor gear. This stuff is SUPER well made, and will last a long time, even on a farm."
5.0,"Once you know your size, getting them via Amazon is great.  These pants are durable and fit great."
5.0,I wear a size 38x34 in levis and the 38 carhartts fit me perfectly. These pants meet every single one of my expectations as a contractor that works on home repairs and maintenance all day long. I couldn't ask for anything more and the five pairs I own are all I ever wear to the job.
5.0,Excactly what I ordered. If you know your carhartt size already then you get what you order
4.0,Ok first off these run a size small(tight for loose fit). And yes they are the thinner fabric which is what I wanted. Other than the size thing I like them.
5.0,"Lightweight, durable, they fit well and are very comfortable. I can wear them all year. The side pocket fits a cell phone and the loops fit a paintbrush or hammer. If you are looking for the heavy-duty pants, get the 12 oz. duck with the double-knee. These are more the weight of jeans."
1.0,"Like the previous reviewer noted, these pants are several sizes smaller than what you'd expect.  Since they're not any sort of standard size, I have no idea what size I'd need to order.  Makes ordering clothes online impossible."
1.0,First-these pants do not even come close to the Carhartt's I have purchased in the past.  It really makes me wonder if they are real Carhartts.  Second the sizing is not even close!  If you take a 36 waist and you order a 36 be prepared to send them back.  Even though they will be marked as a 36 they will seem more like a 32 waist
5.0,"Good work pants.  Pretty durable and comfortable. This is my third pair.  I wish Carhart would make a version of these pants with more durable knee patches, like out of ballistic nylon, thin removable knee foam pads would be great too."
3.0,Too large for my son.
5.0,"I wear these almost everyday of the year in Alaska. I do a moderate amount of outdoor labor. They'll last about a year. Wear them every other day, they'll last two years. Worth it."
5.0,Comfortable and good looking.
3.0,Very happy with this product..
4.0,I followed an earlier review and ordered a waist size larger. Perfect fit. Very comfortable.
5.0,Fits great. Getting compliments at work!
2.0,I thought they're going to be the heavyweight heavy duty car hearts but they were not you're still good if you have to read small print next time
3.0,"Same fit, but they have gone to a much lighter weight fabric. I don't expect these to hold up like my previous pair."
5.0,"Jusr what we hoped for. color, fit, weight are perfect."
3.0,They are ok I have dickies carpenter jeans from Walmart that are thicker and more durable. I ordered 2 pairs the exact same size- one fit perfectly and the other was very tight in the waist. So be aware of the inconsistency
2.0,Sent back. Too large.
4.0,"I was looking for a fairly lightweight work pant that was a relaxed fit. These fit great and don't bunch up when I have to squat down. As I live in the deep south, they feel fairly light and not hot. I plan on buying several more"
4.0,These are the only pants my hubby will wear. I like that they last a long time even when he works in the shop
5.0,as expected
5.0,Washed well. Comfortable fit
5.0,Very satisfied with product purchased.
1.0,"I wear Carhartt all day, every day  Various models, all blue or duck.  I wear a 34"" waist (way too loose, but I wear many layers) and a tight belt.  Bought these in my usual size because I needed something a little more formal (this is as formal as I get) with ""normal"" colors.  I laundered with confidence, as I always do - cold wash/delicate dry - and was shocked when I put these on.  Way too tight in the waist could barely breathe.  I had two days of business to conduct so I wore them, regardless.  Have not worn since and will give to charity.  Had I not had some unexpected business, I would have returned.  Terribly disappointed."
5.0,These are great pants for work or casual wear. I would order up one size if you are on the fence as to what to choose.
5.0,Perfect in every way.  Quality - fit - shipping.
5.0,Great pair of pants.
3.0,"You never know how they are going to fit. I bought one pair a little to large and they fit great, next pair same size and I had to have them altered to fit in the waist. At forty bucks a pop (40) you would think quality control would be better!"
3.0,Very loose fit.
4.0,great pant
4.0,Very durable & comfortable.
1.0,"Ordered two new pairs, one pair was used with dog hair and no tags."
4.0,buy 1 size larger for these
4.0,"Good fit, good quality. I will be ordering another pair, like the variety of colors too."
5.0,The relaxed fit allows for extra room so order true to size or smaller as they don't shrink a whole lot.
3.0,"Got 35/32. Waist fine, legs very long. Nice quality."
1.0,Fit good
4.0,Fit as expected.
5.0,These pants fit perfectly. You choose your size and they come exactly the size you want them to be.
5.0,"Been wearing these jeans over a year now, so I can say they really last through countless wearings and washings. Comfortable, no loose threads, tough, and lots of pocket space. Will definitely buy again."
1.0,too small but not their fault
5.0,"Fit great, look great, feel great. I bought a couple other pairs and work with for my needs. Material is tough flr outdoor use but on pair got snagged on a corner and ripped a small whole quite easily but hasn't ripped further and still holding together quite well."
5.0,"Fits great, looks good. Handy pockets."
5.0,Perfect pants! Will be buying more for sure.
5.0,"These are great general purpose pants that I don't have to worry about abusing that I wear at work. I have another pair just like it that I use for home improvement projects. Light weight, comfortable, and according to my wife, easy on her eyes..."
3.0,Very low grade canvas.
5.0,The pants are great. I work in them daily and they hold up really good.
5.0,They're a little baggy but I'm going to wash them a couple of times then review again.
5.0,Like the way they fit
5.0,Great Jeans
4.0,"Good Pants, Seem pretty durable and still some what professional looking, depending on the seting."
5.0,Nice. Go Carhartt
1.0,Sizing is not  accurate.  The waste is 2 sizes to small. Seller return policys is very short.
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,Great jeans. Very durable.
5.0,quality as expected..
1.0,Sorry material cant believe these Carhartt
5.0,This is my second pair and I will be getting more. These are very comfortable and fit great. I have bigger athletic legs and they fit just fine.
3.0,My Husband loved these. Looked and fit great. But after only wearing them ONE day the rivet button on the pocket broke off.
5.0,"Nice work pants, medium weight, waist I little tight when first on but loosen to a perfect fit, waist also a little higher which is nice, length slightly long but acceptable, comfortable fit throughout the legs and seat.  Bought two pair of different colors both fit exactly the same.  Heavy duty seams, pants appear to be holding up well in my world of construction. Best all-around work pants for me currently, will buy again."
5.0,Been a carhartt person for many years.  Love them
5.0,Quality trousers.
4.0,"i am a 32 waist and i ordered a 33 just in case... and i have to say 33 still a little tight, nevertheless pants are good quality"
5.0,gave as a gift.  Apparently fits well as we haven't heard!
5.0,"Great fit, Good quality"
2.0,They look like his other Carhartt pants but the waist is an inch smaller.
5.0,Other than being too small
5.0,Love the way they fit and look on my husband.
5.0,These are my go-to pants for work. They present a nice product to wear in the office and also in the field for the construction industry. They are very comfortable and hold for decent for the amount of wear and tear I put them through. I continue to buy different color options.
5.0,Hubby loves this brand because it comes in a 35 waist.
1.0,"Material is cheap and the sizes are not accurate. I have 4 other pairs of work pants in both denim and canvas that all fit perfectly, but those exact dimensions in this product are too short and too narrow, both in waist and thigh. If you like loose fit,  I wouldnt waste time or money with this product, it fits like a regular/slim, especially in the thigh. Completely disappointed in this name brand product, I expect more."
5.0,"Summer pants! Thin (but durable) material. I got these for hubby for winter work pants. Nope! I am saving them for spring/summer. Thermals would be uncomfortable underneath as well. They fit nice and he looks pretty sexy in em, too!"
5.0,Great fit!
4.0,will buy again
5.0,"Husband who is a town worker loves them. They've been worn so much, you can't even see the original color in them, but not a single tare"
5.0,Product was dad described and was exactly what I was expecting.
5.0,"I have to wear khaki colored pants as part of my uniform for a construction company. As a big man, (61 & 275) Ive struggled to find pants that fit well. These have plenty of room the legs and thighs, seek to be pretty durable, and they come out of the dryer with no need to iron. These are now my go to work pants and I plan on ordering more next pay day."
5.0,Very high quality and super comfortable to work in for hours. Durable and well designed pockets for the tradesman...
5.0,Always the best.
5.0,Should have ordered a size up! Was a little tight!
5.0,Love these pants!  Bought two more pair. :)
3.0,"little high in price, stiff material but hopefully that will change after several washes"
5.0,"My husband really likes the fit of these pants and the fact that they are not as heavy as the regular ones.  I think they wear out a little faster,but not enough to complain about."
4.0,"Nice pants, good fit."
4.0,had to return.  pants were to small.  I am ordering again larger size.
5.0,"Very nice fit.  Comfortable,  rugged, durable.  Love these pants."
5.0,
1.0,"Ordered a pair of 32/34 pants and the waist was no where near a 32, more like a 26.."
5.0,"I have to wear these for work. Pretty durable, very comfy and the side pockets are sized just right. I usually get a year of use from a pair of these. Only complaint=very rare to find these on sale"
5.0,Had a pair of these that were at least 4 years old with holes and couldn't find a better brand so ordered these. Got the new pair today and fit perfect! Would definitely order again!! Thanks
5.0,"Comfortable, well made and looks to be tough and long wearing. Useful number of pockets. Nice color."
4.0,Not as sturdy as their ripstop version but much softer and the style and size are consistent with other Carhartt pants I've purchased.  Will be good for  light duty jobs and for heading into town to the hardware store.
4.0,My favorite
5.0,"The fit is just right ,and the cell phone pocket is a good size. I will oder more"
5.0,"My husband LOVES these Carhartts.  They last and last and last.
I usually buy him some of these pants, albeit in different colors, every year for his birthday and Christmas."
5.0,Really like these for casual wear. Fit as expected and not too tight through the seat and the legs
5.0,Great pants
5.0,The fit is perfect.  Husband loves his new pants.  Will order more.
1.0,One sizes bigger than you have the right size
5.0,Super comfortable work pants with a good amount of pockets.
5.0,Great fit!
3.0,Light duty work pants would be 5 stars except zipper seems to constantly work itself open
3.0,Returned because they didn't fit but no problems with the return process.
3.0,great pants but sizes are off. in every other pants I've had I'm a 34x32. in these I'm a 36x30.
5.0,Very durable and look great. I work in construction and they hold up and fit very nice. A little tight at waist because I ordered a size smaller than needed.
1.0,"I ordered a 34 waist and the fit was closer to a 32 or a 30. Also, the fit was not ""loose"" as the description would lead you to believe. The upper thigh and seat were far too tight, and the knee/shin area was far too loose. It seems like that should be the other way around. Don't be like me, try these on in a store before ordering."
4.0,Works great. Use them while doing tree work and landscaping. No issues. In good rotation they will last a year + of hard work
5.0,Great quality and fast!
3.0,"Bummer. Nice pants. Comfortable. Fit well. But... my iPhone 6 Plus is about one inch too long for the ""cell phone pocket"". I sat down and my phone dropped out right away. Total deal breaker. These will be returned. Hey Carhartt, a couple inches of material added to the cell phone pocket would make these useable for a whole lot of people who use larger sized smartphones."
5.0,"As with most Carhartt men's clothing, you have to be careful on sizing and these pants are no different. If you normally wear a 32, you will have to go with a 33. 32 will be too small, and 34 too big! Other than that, Great pair of work pants."
4.0,"Quality is good, but the fit is too small around the waist."
5.0,I bought these for work in an industrial setting. Nice loose fit let's me move easily. Grey color is good for hiding stains.
4.0,Husband loves these. Comfortable and durable. Likes the pockets.
3.0,Loved the quality & ordered 5 pants & 1 lined overall that are all too small?! They run small & its incredibly inconvenient.
5.0,Fits great. Got another pair for work.
5.0,Excellent pants
2.0,"Watch the fit! Measured against a pair of Gap pants that fit well. These were way too small in waist, way too long in length.  I wear a 34/30, in these, would be 37x27!"
5.0,Durable and comfy work pants. Fit as expected.
5.0,my husband won't wear anything else. They last a long long time before they are wore out.
4.0,The loose fit we're tighter than the regular fit
5.0,These are a little lighter weight than the original carhartt- so they are great for warmer weather but still the durable rugged material.
5.0,"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length."
4.0,They seem pretty durable. I like them. They fit good.
5.0,Wonderful fit.
5.0,Best pants around for a tall skinny guy. Ones of the few brands that has a variety of sizes for people over 64.
4.0,After reading other reviews order 42 waist instead normal 40.  Glad I did 4 stars cause apparently the 42 or like a normal 40
3.0,"THE WAIST AND SEAT FIT PERFECTLY, THE LEGS  WERE WIDER AND A LITTLE LONGER THAN I,M USE TOO. WIILL WERE THEM IN THE WINTER WITH LONG JOHNS."
5.0,Bought for my husband and is exactly what we expected!
1.0,The baggiest pair of pants Ive ever had.  These pants are like acworking mans bell bottom.  No tailoring or trim look.  Not what I expected. I won't get these again
5.0,"good material, durable feeling."
5.0,Love these pants
5.0,"Great pants, just a bit long,"
3.0,Much too baggy for my liking
4.0,They are as presented.
3.0,Did not fit like expected.
5.0,I bought these for my father in law and he loves them bop
5.0,Great product. Fits exactly. Rugged material.
5.0,Love these pants. More $ than what I usually wear but I wanna buy a shi$ton of them. So comfortable and pockets are good size. Side pocket fits can of grizzly perfectly. Cheaper and better than the bro brand Duluth trading.
5.0,Comfortable work pants
4.0,A little tighter in the waist than expected and pretty baggy legs overall. Great quality though for work pants.
3.0,The pants are some what more baggy than expected. But when I opened the bag for the pants it smelled like poop.
4.0,Nice pants!
5.0,Very nice men's work pants and so much cheaper to purchase here on Amazon then at the local Tacoma work wear Store but I highly recommend if you wear a size 40 then get 1 size bigger because even though it's a really nice pair of pants it runs small and unfortunately I'm having to send back mine and having a place a reorder of the correct size so it's unfortunate because it's a inconvenience but as we all know it's simple to letting Amazon know the status and issues and getting a refund and then having to Place another order for the exact same pants just a size bigger.
5.0,I love these pants. Very sturdy and not too heavy for California weather.
5.0,They are awesome. They fit great. Durable and light weight. I love them
5.0,If you need loose pants then these are for you.
3.0,Going to have to return these. I'm not sure if they were labeled wrong or just run much smaller then my other pant but these came no where near to fitting me. Carhartt has been a quality brand in the past and I've never has this issue
4.0,Little longer than my size. I'm normally a 34x34 but the pants feel like a 34x36 (little too long)
4.0,Fits as expected and delivered as promised.
4.0,Great pants.. really hold up! True to size
4.0,I expected the knees to hold up a little longer that 6 months before getting a hole in them. I guess that's what the double knee is for......
4.0,"These are my first pair of Carhartts. They fit a bit snug at the waste, but loosens a bit after some wear. The fabric is strong, but not harsh to the touch. Beware of the technology pocket! The hammer loop rests just above the technology pocket. If you are not looking, you might mistaken the loop for the pocket and drop your phone."
5.0,"Very comfortable, room in the legs to move, lighter"
5.0,The right fit for the job. Somewhat thinner than other duck pants but very good quality. Comfortable to walk around in.
5.0,Great stuff...
5.0,These pants fit as expected
5.0,Fits great
5.0,Very satisfied with the product!
5.0,Fits as expected
5.0,"just right fit and great brand, always a good buy with carhartt"
3.0,Waist is smaller than labelled size
3.0,The pictures are deceiving these pants fit  too loosely.
2.0,Way to big in the waist
5.0,They don't make my butt look big
5.0,Baggy like the 90's jeans.  will buy again!
5.0,Husband loves them and there holding up nicley?
5.0,"Its Carhartt, Quality work pants that lasts for years."
5.0,Love these Carhartts. This is my favorite material. Not too stiff. And the pockets are great for your cell phone etc. I wear a pair to work everyday. I buy 3 pairs every year and toss them out when they're done. Perfect for hard working guys.
5.0,Really nice pants. Fit just right.
5.0,"Great work pants, wear them every day while working in tough conditions. Couldnt ask for a better pant."
5.0,I have the same pants in Tan too.
1.0,it's a shame that they still is the name Carhartt.
3.0,I returned these as the fit was too loose in the legs. Waist was spot on.
4.0,My son purchased
1.0,This is my second pair. The first time I bought my size and they were too tight. The second pair I bought I ordered one size too big but then after the wash they also became too tight. I really wish I could use this pants but I'm afraid to buy 2 sizes up.
5.0,"We live in Las Vegas, my husband prefers these over all other work pants.  To keep him cooler in the desert heat."
4.0,"Pants seem put together well. I'm 5"" 11"" and 180. medium build. Pants seem a little droopy in the crotch. Guess it depends when you where them on your waist. Would be nice to have a flap over the cell phone pocket. It just feels a little loose and could fall out when riding bike or motorcycle. I ride and I don't feel comfortable leaving the phone in the cell pocket. Need a secure flap with some Velcro or button. Other than that ... good pants. I bought 2 pairs , mushroom and coal."
5.0,My husband liked these so much that he bought more! Great product!
3.0,"Great pants however when we received them along with 2 other pants we washed them.
They did not fit. When I measure them instead of a 42 waist they were a 36 waist.
I suggest you measure them before washing. The maker put the wrong label inside- not the sellers fault."
5.0,Perfect fit. My go to work pant.
5.0,My husband loves them for work.
3.0,Loose fit cut not as generous as expected. 36 waist more like 35.5.
4.0,Nice pants but runs small!!
5.0,Best Pants great price!!
5.0,Great fit
5.0,"Love these pants, I'm a big guy, 6' 1"" 290lbs and these have lasted me a year so far and construction is not easy on clothing"
5.0,Bought for my son and he loves the comfort and fit of pants.
5.0,Setting a goal to fit into.
2.0,To long
5.0,Nice fit
1.0,I've ordered several pairs of these pants over the past few years. These recent ones are smaller than the rest and have no tag. They also feel like a different material. Took them to a local store to compare them to the ones they stock and they are very different. Showed a employee and they said they looked like knock offs. Further online research and they were indeed knock offs. Sending them back.
5.0,"My hubby likes this. He is very comfortable working in a construction doing the squatting, bending, and stuff. I didn't regret I bought this as a gift for him."
5.0,I have seven pair now and they're a great fit and feel.
5.0,I use for work and it is very comfortable.  I will continue to purchase the Carhartt brand for work attire.
4.0,Carhartt pants run very small in the waist. I wear a 38-40/34 and I got 42/34 and the still.are snug
5.0,Everything as expected
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them for work...he is a welder.
5.0,"...and reasonably stylish.  Fit is pretty much like a normal pair of pants in the waist/hip/thigh.  By my estimation the ""loose fit"" part is the legs which are very roomy starting at the thigh through the bottom of the pant leg (this aspect of the pants doesn't seem obvious in the product pictures).  Anyway makes the legs kind of breezy/comfortable plus plenty of room for work boots but they also look fine with just regular shoes."
5.0,I love the beige it is perfect the fit is perfect couldn't ask for a better pair of jeans then this.
5.0,"These work pants are not only super comfortable, but they are also durable, & light
Weight. I'm a union Electrician, & they are my regular wear! "
5.0,"Great fit , very comfortable"
5.0,Great pair of summer work pants light but strong enough for the job.
5.0,I love these trousers -- very comfortable fit.  I have already bought a second pair.
5.0,"Bought for light work pants, they are not as heavy as original Carhart material. Perfect for light work, may not hold up well if you have to crawl around or have a tendency to wear jeans out quickly."
5.0,Great price. Saved $10 per pair versus local store. The paints do run a little small so it would be smart to buy one size up in waste size .
5.0,Great pant for casual dress work and play. The hammer handle is fairly understated so they look nice and wear well.
5.0,"can't really blame the sizing. i ordered the same size as a previous identical pair that I've had for years. thought i might need a little more room in the waist being that these are work pants. also I'm pretty sure that I'm a little bigger than when i ordered the last pair. ordered the next size and everything is good, great to work in in warmer weather."
5.0,I bought 4 different pairs of these pants in different colors. Carhartt pants tend to run a bit small in the waist so I would recommend getting one size up. I wear a 34 waist but got these in a 36 waist and they fit perfectly! The length is perfect. Great work pants!
2.0,"These are by far the worst five pocket jeans that I have purchased. There are two reasons for my decision. One, the cell phone pocket is placed such that in  a siting position, you are sitting on your cellphone, two, the front pocket depth is 2 "" shorter than other jeans,  say the 151."
4.0,"Standard carharrts but extremely baggy, especially around the thighs.  Nothing wrong with product, but returned because I was looking for a different fit."
5.0,Ordered wrong size
5.0,They fit well and are the quality I always expect fro Carhartt
5.0,"Look good, fit well and they're comfortable. Very durable"
4.0,"Waist size was perfect, but the length was longer than expected. Overall very nice pair of jeans."
5.0,Prefer them to Levi's.
5.0,Carhartt
5.0,Well made
5.0,I use these for work. They fit great and are a good balance between comfort and durability.
5.0,"Fit perfect, great color, know they'll last long."
5.0,Great work pants.  Fits as expected.
3.0,"Seems like they would be nice pants, but they are also cut much smaller than normal. I wear a 34 waist  and I couldn't even zip these up all the way, let alone close the button. So I'm returning them."
4.0,"Wore them for about a week now, working in a high volume kitchen. For the most part, they're a great pair of work pants so far, the cell phone pocket is a very nice addition seeing as I need to be in touch with a lot of people throughout the day. Hammer loops aren't necessary so I ended up cutting those off to reduce the risk of them getting caught on anything in the kitchen. Only gripe I have is that they do run a little larger, used my Levi 501 size and these feel really baggy and I have to roll the legs up a bit. But it's not a major detriment to the pants. I'll probably be buying a couple more pairs, just a size smaller then normal."
5.0,"Great quality, fits as expected."
3.0,The waist is smaller then my other  pants
5.0,He loves them
5.0,"I'm 6'3"" and about 160 lbs.  The 33x36 are perfect.  The material is great, too - a lightweight canvas.  It will hold some wrinkles from the laundry spin cycle, but I just fold them carefully and they're fine.  The right-hand utility pocket is big enough for my cell phone + case, which is 6.4x3.5x0.6 inches."
2.0,Did not fit as expected.
5.0,"Great pants, I have purchased these before from a local work-wear shop. HOWEVER, since the last time I bought a pair, Carhartt has changed their sizing. Old, beater pair of 38's still fit fine, new 38's were snug until washed, too tight after. Returning the 38's (Amazon's return process is incredible), and re-ordering 40's. There's a blow to the old self-esteem, but the pants are too good to let ego stand in the way. Cell phone pocket holds a Note 4 easily, other pockets very comfortably sized, and fairly wrinkle resistant."
4.0,"Extremely comfortable .  Move around easily at work.  Lighter than regular jeans, so good for warmer weather."
2.0,Ripped probably day 2 of having them. I was being wreck less but not overly wreck less at work so it kind of sucks to be in the trades expecting a good pair of pants and they rip off a splinter sticking out.
3.0,I'm sure they would have been great but they were way to long. I ordered a 30 length but they were more like 33 or 34.
3.0,5 stars if it was sized correctly.  I got the same pair in a different color and those fit perfectly... these ones run a bit small in the waist.  I wear 33W and I need 34W with these.
1.0,"I bought several carhartt jeans, two online and one in store. All of them fit except for this pair, at least 2 to 3 inches too small in the waist band."
3.0,Little bit full thru the legs almost baggy
5.0,Always been a diehard carhartt fan.
3.0,"Pants are great. Waist runs kind of small. I wear a 34 (which is big on me), these were pretty tight in the waist, maybe I got a misprint?"
4.0,They are a little longer than expected but overall my hubby still loves them and wears them. Very good quality.
5.0,"Fits me nicely, offers great range of motion, durable, comfortable as far as work pants go, and still presentable when not dirty. What else could you ask for in a pair of work pants?"
2.0,Large. But good quality pants.
5.0,"Very happy with my pants, I've been wearing carharts for 10 years, they beat Levi's hands down"
5.0,I'm a diabetic that takes insulin shots in the thigh so I've been searching for a reasonable pair of pants that I can pull up fairly high for taking injections in public. Taking a shot in a standard pair of jeans is an absolute pain in the ass so these things make my life much easier. Plus they give my balls some room too so they're not constantly being squished. I returned and bought 3 more pairs. Normally I wear 34x34 so after reading the sizing comments I went with 36x34 and they fit perfectly!!!
5.0,"great pants, fit well and high quality.  I will buy these again for sure."
2.0,Nice pants. At least a size smaller than i ordered.  Also they are flat fronts
5.0,Best pants ever & highly recommend!!
5.0,Good price for good work pants
5.0,Going to order mo re
5.0,First pair came defective. Second replacement pair are great. Very easy return process.
4.0,"If you want quality pants to work in, there is no better for the price."
5.0,"These were for my son who wears a 32x34 He said these were tight in the waist, and is hoping that these will loosen up with wear. The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit. I would recommend keeping the packaging and getting a size up as there has been a rash of too small Carharrt items lately, and with that said it is still worth the trouble to get ahold of these canvas slacks.
5 Stars A++ RECOMMENDED
VOTE thumbs UP IF YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL"
5.0,good work pants or casual wear if you want to look like a stud
3.0,"Before I ordered these pants in charcoal grey , I read some reviews and was advised to order a size ' up ' and it's a good thing I did. I wear a size 42 in the waist and ordered a size 44 and although they fit , they fit snug....very snug. The canvas material feels very , very thin , so keep that in mind if you're looking for a tough pair of work pants. For me....they'll be okay for casual wear."
5.0,My husband loves these for summer time working! Jeans are too hit for him but he says these are great!
5.0,"I have a hard time finding pants with the correct combination of fit in the waist and room in the thigh. These fit me just right. I own several pair and they hold up well. I have a difficult time finding them in stores, so Amazon and done."
5.0,"Just a little long.  Other than that ,  perfect."
3.0,Looks fine.
5.0,Carhartt is the best in class
3.0,not a medium duty canvas work pant
5.0,"Fit just like I wanted. Love these with the cell phone pocket and hammer loop. I don't need the tool bag as much with these pants. Built tuff, I have a hard time wearing them out. I just wish they were a little cheaper but in this case you do seem to get what you paid for."
5.0,Fast delivery. Got these for my husband to wear at work. Great product.
5.0,"Great pants, we will see how durable they are in the future."
5.0,Great
4.0,"Great work pants but as a 155 lb 6'2"" skinny dude they are a little baggy. Should fit well for people bigger than myself."
3.0,"31 too small around waist, there are better carhartt pants."
2.0,"I am a 32x32 in all shorts and jeans. I ordered this at 32x32 and couldn't even button them. I then ordered a 34x32 and they fit good but too tight for a belt. Now, I need to re-order them at 3532!!! Very frustrating..."
5.0,I'm a big fan of these pants. I have several pairs and the origin of manufacturing of the last few pairs was Mexico. The two best things about these is the fit and the cell phone pocket which is below the normal pocket a fair distance away from your gonads.
2.0,"Sizing is way off, smaller, significantly, even without washing, than existing Carhartts I have with the same nominal size. Unfortunately, I left them sitting, unworn, in their bag and missed the 30 day return window. Buyer beware ....."
5.0,Husband is a logger. This is the only pants he will wear to work! He gets extremely dirty and works in the woods everyday. Pants hold up wash after wash! Great for men who have heavy duty jobs!
5.0,"Been wearing them for the last 5 years. I'm a maintenance supervisor and they wear well, takes punishment and in the wash and they come out good as new."
4.0,"Nice pants, probably should have ordered a size down"
3.0,Nice but the waste seems like a 34 and the length seems like a 36
3.0,"Great pants but order 1-2 waist sizes larger. Yeah, I know. Also, if you can magically shrink your man hands to the size of a six year old girl's hands, it'll help in getting your keys and wallet out of the pockets."
4.0,too wide
5.0,husband's favorite pants - ordering more
5.0,Great product as always
5.0,"Hi!! I'm Stephanie and work for Doug, a plumber.  I found this style of work pants for him and ordered them many years ago and now he won't wear anything else but these!! Nothing even comes close to them.  He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these...it really made my day! :) Everything about them...he loves but the pockets are the real deal for him!  He loves the way that they curve! So over the years, I've continued to purchase these pants for him along with the same style shorts with the same pockets.  It really breaks my heart that the shorts are no longer available to get.  He worries that he won't be able to get the pants one day as well... so please keep on selling them.  If anyone knows where I can get the Carhartt Men's Canvas Utility Shorts....please let me know!! I've searched the whole internet and still have not been able to locate any of them anywhere :(!! My boss is very upset about that too! I've even called Carhartt head quarters trying to see if they would just make him several years supplies for him but they could not do it! :( I pray that these pants will stay in stock and not be unavailable because my boss will not be a happy man and neither will I because I will have to listen to him complaining everyday about his work pants like he is already complaining about not being able to get the shorts anymore because they are not making them anymore!  Thanks for 2 great items and hopefully those shorts will be made available to purchase again very soon so that I can be happy and my boss can be too! :)  Thanks and have a great day! :) By the way....We both give this product a 5 STAR!!!! *****"
3.0,"Hmmm. Well the pants fit great. I have a problem with the pant legs pockets layout. I'm used the right pocket holding my spare pencils, instead that's the pocket they designed for a cellphone. Then they put the hammer loop right above it, so every time I went to get my cellphone my hand would get slightly entangled in the loop.  I solved the problem with the loop by cutting it off. Only giving three stars because of the leg pocket layout,  which is not a big deal, but it could go up if they hold up to the wear and tear of my work."
1.0,They wear like pajama pants
5.0,"the best, in spite of the price. my daily work pant for almost a year......  3-5 days a week.... fully loaded pockets, all stitching has remained intact."
2.0,"I bought the same size as I do other pants but this fit snug before washing.  If you buy these, get them larger than normal."
2.0,"Bought one pair and fit great , ordered 2 more and didn't even come close to fitting"
5.0,Awesome jeans will buy again
4.0,"The pants are unbelievably durable, yet lightweight and somewhat stylish. Great for different uses and different climates. The side pockets on carpenter pants are very useful, without the pockets sticking out like cargo pants.

I'm docking one star because the sizes are all wrong. I have size 36 waist pants from other brands, that are a looser fit than the 2 pairs of size 40 Carhartt pants I bought. Size 40 fits fine, but Carhartt's ""36"" would have been impossible for me to wear. The company should really look into correcting their measurements. Just a head's up."
4.0,Very durable and comfortable.
1.0,Too
5.0,Love it!
5.0,"Man I love these pants. I highly recommend ditching the blue jeans for work and getting these.
I will be sure to update this as the months past if they become defective or unusable in anyway.  If this review has helped in anyway please hit the helpful button. Thank you."
5.0,"Would take these canvas pants any day over jeans! Way more comfortable, easier to move around in, more breathable, and they last longer! As with all Carhartt pants they fit a little slim compared to other brand pants."
3.0,These would be great pants if it were not for the damn fool hammer loops. Don't suppose one in one thousand use them for a hammer and if it is a fashion statement that would be incredibly lame.
5.0,he loves them
3.0,"If for everyday wear, you will have to be buying more very soon..."
3.0,Ordered a 33 waist maybe got a 31
5.0,The fit is just right for me.  I will buy another pair when I need them.
5.0,Fits perfect better then I thought
3.0,"Great fit in the leg (I have large legs) and as others said the waist is a bit tight so I ordered the next size up, I normally wear a 34x32 in Carhartt denim pants, so I got these in 35x32. These are noticeably tighter in the waist and I probably should have gotten a 36. The inseam was a bit long too; these are at least 1-2 inches longer when compared to the denim. Also, the seat feels a bit cramped when sitting.

Size aside, these are noticeably cooler (temperature) than denim. The leg pocket is a perfect fit for an iphone 6 without a case. They feel really well build, however the sizing is greatly different from Carhartt's denim sizing. I'm not certain I'll be ordering these again."
5.0,A little big at first but once washed they fit exactly like another pair of carhartt pants i have
3.0,Waist fits good legs baggier then expected
5.0,Best work pants ever!
2.0,Small stain on the front of the pants :( right out of the package. Not sure if these were a return item that someone else stained or if they were damaged in storage. The pants were in a sealed package with the stain
5.0,"I like these pants for working in the yard or working on the truck. I ordered a 36"" length because I am 6'5"" tall but they are about 2 inches too long. Either I am getting shorter or they are making pants longer. These pants are very comfortable and would recommend to others. I am going to buy another pair but will order a 34"" inseam instead of 36"""
5.0,these pants are comfortable and durable. Great for warm weather working.
5.0,"Love these so far. Fit great, lots of useful pockets, very comfortable. Hammer loops on both sides for us lefties. I'll report back in a few weeks to see how the knee area is holding up. That's usually the first to go on my work pants."
5.0,I love these pants they last forever!!!
4.0,Fit better than expected.
4.0,I didn't realize that these pants have rivets on them near the pockets. I constantly get my finger nails caught on them. The material that they're made out of is good for working in hot environments.
2.0,Ordered 1pair dark jeans 36X32 fit too loose.  When measured with tape inseam 33 in.  waist 37 in. left side  18 in right side 19in. Its like a 36 side was sewn to a 38 side. Had 1 hammer loop or right side.  Ordered light pair - the same except hammer loop on each side.  Both pair the rear seam is off center.  Ordered 34 hoping for good fit....nope 34 was a perfect 34 had to return them.  No more Carhartt for me...
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,My husband loves these for work. Fits great
5.0,Just what I hoped for...and lots of pockets! !!  Ordering another pair
5.0,"Very comfortable work pants with quality stitching and deep pockets.  Are a great pant for the summer since they are a thinner, cooler material than regular blue jeans.  Also the lighter color material doesn't get as hot in the sun and makes it easier to find crawling ticks."
5.0,"I'm 6'3"" 200#. They fit perfect"
2.0,"When they say loose fit, they mean loose fit."
4.0,Buy the next size bigger for the waist or they won't fit. Length is a touch long as well but ok.
2.0,"Legs are too wide, flapping wings or bell bottoms"
5.0,Very comfortable and light weight.  Lighter than B11's.  Good quality and durable.  My go to casual slacks
5.0,Great work pants.  Phone with protective case fits in deep pocket nicely. Washes  well.
3.0,"Comfortable, durable, well constructed.

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

Disappointing. I'm not going to through the pants out but I can not wear them for work."
5.0,Fit better than my levi's or wranglers and the material is great. Gonna be a great work pant. Yes Sir.
5.0,Good work pants. They last long and don't get torn easily
3.0,Definitely a loose fit.
5.0,Great pants to brew beer in. Not as tough as the double front variety but not as expensive.
3.0,Sadly don't last very long before starting to rip best works pants they just don't last i have gone trought 3 pairs of these while I'm on my first pair of dikeys that Are still going strong
5.0,Just what we were looking for. Perfect
5.0,These are amazing!  Bought for my son and he instantly had a smile on his face when he put these on.  Very comfy!!
5.0,Good fit.
4.0,Tighter in the legs and crouch areas then the other types of loose fitting paints that I have bought.
5.0,"This is about the 10th pair I have bought for my husband, no complaints."
5.0,The best feature of these pants is the ability to put an iPhone 7 Plus in the lower right side pocket. I wish more manufacturers would make pants like these.
5.0,good quality
5.0,Great work pants
2.0,My son loves all Carhartt clothing for work but he is a 28x32 which is a hard size to find. He has three pair that fit him well. These did not. Too long and too big!!
3.0,"The waist, butt, crotch fit fine, but the length is short for me.  I have other Carhartts and they are fine for length, these just don't have the length I want."
5.0,
5.0,"Great pants, comfortable and looks great."
2.0,"generally, fit was good. However, unless you have tiny hands, you'll never be able to use the front pockets. My hands are about average for my height, I usually wear a medium large glove,so I cant understand this oversight in design."
3.0,"The pants looked great, but were tighter than the shorts of the same waist made by Carhartt. I have had cheaper denim jeans that have lasted longer without tearing in the crotch. The material was thin and was easy to tear. These work pants barely lasted the winter season."
4.0,I already had a pair of these from a year ago and the new pair is a bit different.  The side pocket is a little bigger and they fit a bit tighter around the waste than my original pair did (and no I didn't gain weight).  Great pair of pants tho.
4.0,Ordered wrong size.
5.0,My boyfriend is very athletically built and has a hard time finding pants that aren't too tight in the thighs and too big in the waist. These work great and look good.
3.0,"They r made small like the old hip huggers years ago. How can I return them to get regular jeans.
  Ron"
5.0,"I've gotten these pants in the past, and my work is pretty rough on clothes. Definitely worth the extra money over other work pants, or just an old pair of jeans"
2.0,"As stated in other reviews, sizes are off.  Mine are marked ""made in Nicaragua.""  I usually wear a 36 in other Carthartt.  Bought a 38 because of reviews.  Still too tight in the waist.  Lots of room in the legs though."
5.0,Bought these for my husband and they fit perfect.
5.0,"Nice, durable. Quick delivery."
4.0,"Nice pants, they are sized small in the waist and long on the length. They still fit but I wouldn't call them loose fit"
4.0,Legs to large
5.0,A great pair of pants!
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,"love these pants! perfect sized pockets in perfect locations. I conceal carry and I found the pockets are excellent for extra magazines/knives/multi-tool. super comfortable and durable. They feel stiff when you first get them but, like denim, wear in nice and provide comfort and toughness"
5.0,carhart quality as usuall.u can find cheap immitations but that's what they are cheap.i am a welder and no other pants hold up like these.
5.0,Perfect for my son who is 6'5.  They fit perfectly and wear very well.  He wears them for work on the farm.
1.0,Did not fix as expected. Very short and shrunk terribly
5.0,Awesome fit and super comfortable. Hands down the best pair of work pants you will ever own.
1.0,too small and I was too lazy to return
5.0,I really like these pants. Fit loose and hokd around the waist nice. Good Durability.
5.0,very well made nice fit
4.0,"A little snug, recommend getting one size bigger"
5.0,"Comfortable, durable nice looking work pants. Fit is true to size and very comfortable."
5.0,Perfect fit and great quality as always.
4.0,Good trou.  Feel good.  Look good.
5.0,Carhartt sizes seem a bit on the smaller size. Tough to find the in-between perfect fit. I do like them though. Try them out.
2.0,"These are my ""go to"" pants for everyday wear. Sometimes I can't find them locally, so I thought I'd try through Amazon. The fit was very poor. They were too tight in some places and too loose in others. When I buy them locally, the fit is fine. I don't know where these pants were made, but I suspect that has something to do with it. The material also turned out to be very different from what I wanted. These pants were a heavy duck material, and I prefer the lightweight khaki material. When I returned them, I got a note suggesting that the post office wouldn't deliver.....odd!"
5.0,my favorite work pants
4.0,Was good
2.0,did not fit me right
1.0,Received the pants + Too large + Send it back + Get $6 less than paid for in a refund = 1 star review
2.0,Too baggy
3.0,I like these pants.  Been buying them for years now. I probably have 15 old pairs and every single pair has a hole in the right knee. They only last about 5 to 6 months then bam!  Hole in the knee. Like clock work
5.0,He loved them! Will be ordering more!!!
5.0,"These fit as expected, I like them, I like the pocket for the phone another for the wallet another for the knife, etc"
5.0,Glad they fit perfect and didn't have to send them back.
4.0,Good fit
5.0,Good pants not as thick material as the older ones but still good.
4.0,"comfortable, lightweight"
3.0,Ok but not loose enough in the legs and seat.
4.0,The color looked more gray online
3.0,Ordered my proper size against best advice. Way to small. Had to reorder larger. Pants are fine. Just figure out your sizing carhart.
5.0,I bought these for my husband. This is the second pair I bought him. They are great for work on hot days.
5.0,I knew what size I needed already so the fit is perfect!
5.0,"Great work pants, well made with good weight fabric. All the pockets you need."
5.0,"Great product,"
5.0,Love these pants:)
4.0,Good quality.
5.0,These are the only pants I wear anymore.
5.0,These are the best fitting work/casual pants. I'm tall and thin/athletic and it's hard to find a pant that isn't too baggy or tight and that's the right leg length. I like them so much I bought another exact pair.
5.0,love them
5.0,Best work pant I've ever owned!  Comfortable and durable!
4.0,Order three inches larger than your waist size.
5.0,"Good pants, hate there not made in the USA anymore."
5.0,Awesome work pants. Very durable but looks sharp and professional.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted in two days!
4.0,I like the pant. The large range is sizes is great as I wear a 34 x 36 which are hard to find.
4.0,"I like the pants but these were shorter than my other Carhartts 30"" inseam and seemed tighter in the waist"
5.0,"love the pants. construction and build are of quality, but the waist is a bit on the tight size. i will probably only be able to wear for a year."
5.0,"I wasn't sure how I'd like the navy color, but I like it a lot"
4.0,NICE
5.0,"Fast shipping, and great product!"
3.0,Run a little bit smaller. I barely can close the button.

5.0,fantastic pants.  love the cell phone pocket and durable fabric.  wears well
5.0,Very comfortable. Fit as expected.
2.0,Ordered my regular size. Way to small. Ordered once size bigger and i'm swimming in them.
5.0,fits just right!
5.0,husband loves them.
5.0,"These look nice enough for a casual day at the office but are rugged enough for camping, yard work, etc. As comfortable as an old pair of jeans. Big fan of the side phone pocket. My iPhone 7 fits perfectly. I wear a hard to find size (33W x 36L) and these guys make it very easy to find my size in whatever style I'm looking for."
4.0,"Other than fit in waist, I really like the pants.  would order an inch larger if I had it to do again."
1.0,"Horrible. Ordered a size larger and still did not fit.
Sad... carhart was my favorite but not anymore.
AVOID.!!"
5.0,"Great pants, use them a lot working in the garage.  Cell phone in one side pocket and pliers,or knife, or some other tool in the other.  Hold up great, this is my 2nd pair, still using the first pair... just needed another for when they are in the wash."
5.0,Great pants
4.0,"The only thing I did NOT like was that the very top & one side of the cell phone pocket was NOT sewn to the the pant leg!! VERY annoying when walking around on job site all day, had to take to my seamstress & she FIXED the problem for me!! CARHARTT, the very BEST work clothes made but there is always room for improvement. So this is the reason y'all didn't get 5 stars. This is the second review I've written to y'all & if I don't hear back it is the last cause there will NOT be a strike Three!!! This is what y'all get when your clothes are made in MEXICO, PLEASE BRING BACK Y'ALL'S FACTORIES TO AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,thinly made but super comfy
4.0,Just a lil bit tight of the waist.
5.0,Will buy again
5.0,Great work jeans.
4.0,"I had to return, they run small in waste but true in length, for example, I wear a 34/32 I would have to order a 36/32 to fit in waste. I wear Levi jeans hope it helps someone in sizing"
5.0,Tears  easy. Won't last thru the season
5.0,fits exactly the way I thought they would.  Good quality clothing
4.0,Great pants. Just too snug. very durable
4.0,"Great pants, loose around the thigh. Waist runs a little small. Order one size larger than you normally wear and you'll be good to go."
4.0,"Great work pants. Or all around pants, really. Lighter than the other carhartts I own. Good fit."
5.0,Have several pair. All are very comfortable and fit well. Lighter weight than some of the other series.
5.0,"FAST SHIP, GREAT GIFT"
5.0,Great pants
5.0,"Okay so I originally bought these in a 32 30 and they were too short, so then I returned and bought a 32 32 and they were too long. I think Carhartt has weird sizing so it may take a few tries to find what fits you right, but its great quality and worth the money."
5.0,"These are the only pants my son has worn for a couple of years.  They are a heavy weight, but not as stiff and heavy as some of the other Carhartt pants.  He is picky and he thinks they are very comfortable."
5.0,Great pant love the color fit perfect  shipping fast
5.0,Perfect for my husband
5.0,Perfect fit  and material.

5.0,"Great color, fit and style for work."
5.0,Fit great. Look great.
4.0,"I am usually size 36 waist (32 unseen). I ordered 38x32 to be safe and am glad I did. They fit with no room to spare. I have bigger than average legs, and these pants are very comfortable in the legs. They are thin, but feel well made. I'm happy with them."
5.0,Sent to my son in the AF in ND.  Came in in time and fit perfectly.  Heavy material and rugged.
5.0,"Fits well, good pockets. I'm a commercial electrician and since buying my first pair a couple years ago, there has been no reason to try other work pants."
5.0,Great pants and live up to the brand name well
4.0,"Nice, comfortable pants for work or casual wear."
4.0,"Pants are great quality and very nice pants, only negative is that Carhardt must run small because every other pair of 34x30 are loose fitting but these are snug. Yet still a great pair of quality pants"
5.0,The first pair were a little big in the waist. This pair fits perfectly!
5.0,So far so good
5.0,"Great pants.  Durable, look good, super comfortable, big pockets!!"
3.0,"I wear a 34 waist in my Levi's so I bought the same in these pants, they arrived and feel just as durable as the rest of Carhartt's products however the 34 waist was quite smaller than my Levi's, I returned them and got the 35 waist, they arrived and they are still tighter than my Levi's. I bought 2 pair but may return the second pair after testing the first pair further."
4.0,"they do not have 37W-31L, so I bought 38W-32L and tried to shrink.  still a bit large."
5.0,Perfect fit. Perfect length.
5.0,"Perfect weight, comfortable and durable."
4.0,I would have to go a waist size larger to fit an inside the waistband holster.
5.0,"Solid product, good service, thank you."
5.0,All good!
1.0,ordered 5 pairs... one was the wrong color. who would buy these pants if in bulk if they were not for a job or something.. why sub the wrong color. now i got to deal with a return.
4.0,Nice
4.0,"Not as heavy weight material as I expected, but they look good and fit well."
4.0,Satisfied
4.0,I have some older Carhartts and ordered the same size as those pants and these ran a little bit smaller. I can still wear them but they are more snug.
3.0,Length is a bit short. I'll order 30 x 32 next time.
5.0,EXCELLS.
5.0,excellent quality durable and better than the rest
4.0,"Love them, I've bought many pairs just wish the would last longer"
5.0,"This cut is for below the wais by design by Carhartt - and as such they fit as expected. Nice loose fit on the legs.

Do remember to check Carhartt's guides as the ""Regular"", ""Relaxed"", ""Loose"" aren't just the diameter - they affect where the belt sits. Above, at, or below the natural waist.

With a few more chest pounds than I'd like I need the belt just below the natural waist . This ""Loose Fit"" is designed to sit right there."
5.0,Perfect fit great work pockets
2.0,These pants certainly are not loose fitting. Very poor representation by Carhartt.
5.0,I love Carhartt pants on my husband! They fit better than any other brand he has worn. Great quality! Highly recommend!
4.0,It is always hard for me too find a pair of trouser that fit right.  These do just right.
4.0,"I normally wear a size 42x30 in jeans, however when I received my pair of these Carhartts they were much too small. They couldn't be buttoned, so I was forced to send them back and get a size larger. I'm currently waiting for the replacements now. However, I do like these pants, quite a bit. Its obvious that they are really well made, and are sturdy for day to day work. I was a bit bummed that they didn't fit, but i liked them enough to re-order another pair. When I receive them, i'll be sure to give my final verdict. Until then, Four stars all the way."
5.0,Soft and comfortable.  Will purchase again
5.0,The best work pants I've got! Worth the money for sure! Better than dickies for sure!
5.0,I bought these for my son  for his work and  had them sent directly to him.  He said they wash nicely and are very sturdy ...fit was pervect..
5.0,They seem to be well made. Will buy another pair.  They seem to run small. I take a 34-35 bought a 34 and returned them and got 36 waist.
5.0,Great
5.0,Purchased these pants to replace a worn out pair of carhartt pants that were my husband' s favorite work pants. He was very happy with the fit- true to size. Will be ordering more of these. Satisfied customer.
5.0,Cool
2.0,Fit EXTRA loose
5.0,"Excellent fit. Love the fabric. It's a great everyday pant. If I worked outside everyday in the summer, I'd go with these. If I needed something to work in colder weather, I'd look for something a little thicker."
4.0,They're pants and they fit correctly.  Is that enough for you?!
5.0,"Nice pants, easy through the thigh, multiple hammer loops, cell phone pocket."
5.0,Love these pants
4.0,These were slightly smaller than the same thing I purchased 2 years ago.
5.0,Just what I  wanted!
5.0,"always wrinkled after drying, but they are just work pants so I don't care"
4.0,I ordered one size bigger after reading the reviews that seem to work out about right
5.0,Great
4.0,"Typically I would assume pants like this would be fairly heavy and not practical for wearing in the summer. These are actually quite light weight, to the point I do wish they were somewhat thicker as I am afraid the thin material may affect their longevity. All seams are triple sewn so should hold together fairly well however."
5.0,"Pants fit great and look even better, expected to last a long time"
5.0,I love the style but the waste is too small.
3.0,fit somewhat small in waist compared to other pants of same size...maybe they will stretch...or shrink with washing
5.0,"love these pants they are now the only ones i rock at work, play, and the occasional riot only kidding cause i'm working for a living WORKIN"
3.0,These are comfortable pants. They are 100% cotton so I'm not sure how long they will last if you are doing outdoor work or looking for a pant that will be rugged. I'm also not sure where they get these pants sized because they are far from correct. I wear a 32 waist jean and 32-33 waist in slacks. I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans. The length seems to run about an inch or so long but you can shrink them. So length isn't really a issue. I suggest if buying to be prepared to way over size the waist size by at least 3-4 inches.
5.0,"GREAT pants!  Carhartt makes a great pair of pants.  Wear like iron, pockets everywhere I need them."
5.0,Perfect!
4.0,"Decent work pants.
Good price.
Carhartt makes a few different pants some seem a bit more heavy duty but these are good late fall early spring pants for the  job sight."
2.0,Had some 32's from a friend I liked but were a tad small. Tried 33's and felt like I was swimming in them.
5.0,"The comfort of these pants is perfect and the size was spot on. The material seems soft but durable, and the color is pretty much what I expected. These are for work and I can see these lasting for a few years easy."
5.0,"These pants are the only pants I wear to work, they take a beating!"
5.0,Looks & fits good
5.0,"My favorite work pants, been wearing these for years. The quality and fit keep being great and the pockets are used on a daily basis!"
4.0,Wearing them right now. No regrets.
2.0,"I have a closet full Carhartts in the exact same size and cut, but these were both too small and too short."
5.0,Fit as expected-perfect for work!
5.0,They're great
5.0,My favorite style and fit of pants
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,Good product
5.0,Great pants! Could wear these everyday.
2.0,"Returning back, size is way smaller than it says.  But Amazon will refund your money very easily!!!"
5.0,"Not many pants work for me in the field I'm in, either don't fit right or they're too uncomfortable. Until I found these. Fit great, feel great, I'm happy!"
5.0,Nice and cool good fit
4.0,No surprises.  A good pair of pants for work.
1.0,too big
5.0,"great , no more levis"
4.0,"The waist size is about a full size small, I bought a 36 waist and fits me like a 34 (tight).  The legs and seat are loose and provide good freedom of movement.  The front pockets are a little small at the top; I have big hands (wear XL gloves) and they are tight getting them into the front pockets but not a huge problem.  The cell phone pocket holds my iPhone 6s with Lifeproof case with some room to spare.  I've only had them a few days so I can't comment on durability yet."
5.0,Good pants
4.0,Nice pants. It's hard to find pants with a cell phone pocket that aren't jeans. I carefully cut the hammer loops off for a nicer look in the office. They do shrink over a few washes. I had to re buy at the next size up on waist and length.
5.0,My hubby loves them!
5.0,For my son only complaint I have heard is that when he is out in the woods the briars go right through the fabric.
5.0,"Great looking pants, good buy for the price."
4.0,They fit fine. I like them
5.0,As expected....Great looks and feel. Carhartt has always done well with my purchases and this is no exception. I'm hard on work pants and these hold as well or better than most.
5.0,Awesome
5.0,Great pair of pants. Phone pocket is big enough to fit a large smart phone in a case. I am buying more in the near future.
5.0,"Sizing is perfect, love the dual hammer loops, very roomy fit and light weight but seems like they will hold up....also very cool leg pockets. These are great pants..... Also reasonably priced.... Great job Carhartt!
Also want to note I'm glad they are not a very heavy weight fabric...
Who wants to walk around sweating all day??"
4.0,"These pants are typical Carhartt quality, durable and comfortable."
5.0,Durable for my husband work
5.0,Yes satisfied with all my purchases.
3.0,Not crazy about the fabric
4.0,"Everything to be expected out of a pair of Carhartts.  They hold up well to a hard day of work day in and day out.  The color I have hides dirt and grease very well.  My only complaint if any would be that the buttons on Carhartts don't go far enough past the zipper,  my zipper is constantly creeping down as I stand and crouch."
5.0,great pants; normal styling; sturdy fabric; nice color; good value
4.0,Size ran a touch small. Front pockets could be deeper. Phone pocket needs to be deeper. Also should add a closure on this pocket to hold phone in. Will probably purchase again only because they closely match a uniform pant that I am required to wear.
4.0,works
4.0,Felt like I was forced to order a size larger than I expected based on the reviews. I feel like a 36 would have been perfect. But I am making do with the 38s. It ensures I have plenty of room to move around for rock climbing. If I had dropped down they may have been to restrictive.
5.0,Comfortable and lightweight.
5.0,"love these pants. i am a female and wear a women's size 6, i buy a size 30x32 in these and they fit great. wash and dry in the dryer well, no shrinking."
5.0,Great pants. Very light and durable too.
1.0,"So they fit, they're nice enough... but I use these pants for work. These pants are noticeably thinner than the other three pair of the exact same Carhartt pants I have. I have jeans thicker than what was shipped to me . I'm not sure why you're buying Carhartt, but I'm buying for durable work pants. What I received are cheap thin ""canvas"" pants which read 100% cotton made in Mexico. I understand ""canvas"" is now double woven cotton but these pants feel like gap khaki's which are very thin compared to all of my other Carhartt pants. I actually have Dickies thicker than these. I'd avoid these unless you are aiming at some sort of trendy hard worker look."
5.0,These pants are great work pants.
4.0,good fit
5.0,Very pricey for work pants but they do last. So you get what you pay for.
4.0,"Material and quality is great as I would expect from Carhartt. However, I wear 34W 32L on all pants and these were small on the waist and long on the leg in a 34W 32L."
4.0,Perfect fit. My cell phone (with case) fits perfectly in the the pocket on the right leg. I've been buying these pants for years. They get the soft feel after the first wash.
5.0,Had to return the first pair as they were a bit snug.  Not sure if they run a little smaller than other brands loose fit?  But they are high quality work pants.  Very happy with the purchase and the return process was a breeze.
5.0,I wear a 36 in most pants but this time I went with a 38 waist and Love them. Very comfortable....
5.0,"I own a pair in every color. I wear every day to work. I have several that are 7 years old,they take a beating and come back for more, I'm in the concrete business and nothing comes close."
4.0,A bit short in the leg length
5.0,Fit great.
5.0,Quality perfect very baggy though.  Still 5 stars for my mistake.
5.0,"This pants are excellent. They feel strong, yet not so stiff. Can't wait to work in them this fall!"
5.0,"Really like these pants.  While new, I will dress them up a bit. Later I will work outside in them.  38 x 36 fits as it should on me."
4.0,Good small for the size
5.0,"My husband has been wearing these for years, he won't work (farmer) in jeans anymore. They are very comfortable."
5.0,"Might as well call these pants bullet proof. Rugged, durable, and sexy as hell while doing mainly shit around the house. Owned a couple pairs like this that I still wear today,  and those pairs have to be over 10 years old. Those carharts still haven't faded, torn, or shrunk.

Solid purchase and will continue to buy.

Please send me some more ;)"
2.0,"Arrived promtly, but 34x32 size, my usual, was too small in both dimensions. Will probably replace them with ripstop cotton carpenter's pants, if still available, which fit fine when bought several years ago.  Carhartt needs to standardize its sizing!!"
4.0,Length was longer than expecting
5.0,"Great pants. My husband finds these much more comfy than jeans. He likes all the pockets; they're symmetrical pockets, so if he's carrying, say, small heavy tools, the weight can be balanced, and he claims that the pocket (and fabric loop) placement prevents stuff falling out. He wears these with Hold-Ups suspenders."
5.0,good work pants.
5.0,Wow. My legs are big for my waist size. I need pants with a loose fit to be comfortable. These are perfect. I washed them cold and did not notice any shrinkage. Material is strong yet light. I will be buying a couple more pairs. Love 'em.
5.0,Love these pants. Last pair I had lasted me years so had to buy more. Would recommend them to anyone else that I's looking for work pants that breath and last years. Worth the price!
3.0,"when i first opened the package, my first impression was ""they are really thin!"" but i tried them on and it works on slacks. im a size and i have to use the very first hole to tie around my hips. but it looks ok. im keeping them because i get a lot of colors for a good price. its a good way to add detail top an outfit."
5.0,Great pants. Get one size larger.
5.0,Awesome work pants! Most comfortable I've ever used! Never wearing jeans to work again you can feel the weight difference at the end of the day! And my wife says it looks great on me!
3.0,Great pants but sizes run small.
5.0,Nice thick fabric!
5.0,They are awesome all the way around.
4.0,I have been looking for pants that will work for my husband at work. We searched many many hours both online and off. When we got these he was kind of sceptical about them. I washed them of course and there was a little shrinking but nothing like others I have bought that were made out of the same material. They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more. This is a regular family purchase for our family.
5.0,Worth every penny.
5.0,Great quality pants that look and feel wonderful.  Has a pocket on the outer thigh that fits my cased phone perfectly. Shrunk only slightly with the first wash.
5.0,Great fit.
5.0,"High quality, durable work pants. My son works with masonry/stone/brick/block. These withstand a lot of abuse."
3.0,Ordered 3 pair 2 fit as per label the other pair seemed to be a size smaller even though it was labeled the same size
5.0,They may say Men's but I'm a relatively average size woman and they have been perfect for me. Great yard work pants with all sorts of pockets for the tools I need.
5.0,Ordered these for construction and wood working. Very comfortable and they don't hug your legs/thigh such as jeans do when you sweat. If you work outdoors these are perfect for you.
5.0,"Nice Pants
Fit is better (not as baggy as regular fit)"
5.0,The fit is comfortable & fast shipment
5.0,Very comfortable and durable work pants.  Well priced.
4.0,I typically buy these at the farm store and pay more for them. But found them on here and I can save between 5 and 10 dollars on them!
5.0,great!
5.0,These pants can take some serious abuse! After 50 washes they still look and perform well.
5.0,These jeans are truly superior compared to other big names.
5.0,Yep pants that fit
5.0,Great pants were someone long at ankles tight at waist but I ordered a size up on the waist like reviews recommended  and it worked well for us .
5.0,Yes
4.0,Nothing
5.0,"I like them, they are longer than the last pair of Carhartt's I purchased, so that is good as I'm 6'6"" and really need a 37"" inseam which nobody makes.  But all my other 38"" waist pants are a little looser than these.  I'm hoping they will loosen up after a few wears.  They aren't too heavy, they're ok for summer wear."
5.0,"I LOVE these. I recently got a tear that would have ripped my jeans apart, but months later the fear is still tiny, and completely wearable. Love these"
5.0,Great pants. Durable. Still wearing them after a year.
5.0,"very nice fit , very comfortable"
4.0,Standard brand that is built with high quality.
3.0,I expected the canvas material to be more course.
2.0,"I have bought these pants at a retail store, and they fit well.  However, these were too small."
4.0,New favorite work pants
4.0,Very durable and confortable
5.0,"Perfect fit, perfect fabric weight. These are a favorite in the shop. Durable and comfortable. Will purchase more."
5.0,Love these pants. Pockets are in the right spots. Pants fit great
5.0,great light work pants for summer
3.0,"I have owned several pairs of these pants throughout the years. I have often purchased them through local stores as well as Amazon, using the same serial or model number-whatever you want to call it. The material Carhartt has started using is rougher and stiff, probably more durable but the old kind was soft and more comfortable. The fit is still the same which I like, but the texture/rigidity of them is annoying."
5.0,Very nice quality.
5.0,Husband loves these pants.
4.0,These fit the bill for what I was looking for. The size was right on for me.
5.0,Good everyday working pant that is comfortable
5.0,Another win for Carhartt!
5.0,I guess we'll be looking for a suitable replacement. My husband loves these pants and we are very disappointed that Carhartt seems to have discontinued making his size (40 x 36).  He wears them everyday on the farm and they last very well.  They have more give than blue jeans and wear just as well.
5.0,My husband loves them. It is all he will wear to work.
5.0,Great pants to work in
5.0,husband loves these Carhartt pants for work
4.0,Great work/carpenter pants! Found them to be a bit smaller than expected. Especially after the wife washed them and put them in the dryer. Don't need a belt for them now! Probably purchase another pair but one size up to allow for additional craft beer consumption.
5.0,"Just ordered my second pair. Great work pants that are comfortable and loose around the legs, for room to breathe and move around! Sizing was perfect"
4.0,Good
3.0,Ordered the same size as several other Carhartt jeans that I own and for some reason these are snug in every dimension and too long in the leg. Extremely durable just like every other Carhartt product. I have not noticed any color fade. Just wish they had a little more room.
5.0,"Great pants, nice fit good price  will be buying more"
5.0,put on a pair of carharts and your sex appeal doubles!
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish. Use them for work and play. Very high quality and stains come out very easily
5.0,Great fit
5.0,"I recently purchased a pair of the B151 Khaki pants and wanted to try a little different style. These are the Loose fit and they are comfortable and fit just like they should. I have had problems in the past finding the jeans that fit my 30"" inseam. They always seem to be just a little long. These loose fit Carhartt B159's are great. They fit my inseam perfectly when I put on my boots. They don't drag the ground behind my boots. Perfect Fit!"
1.0,Fit too small once finally received.
4.0,Good
5.0,I bought those pants for my boyfriend. He's 1.80 mt and 70 kg. Fit perfect. He will buy another one in other color. The quality it's excellent. Very happy with the purchase.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Honestly, the so-called ""loose fit"", to me, isn't ""loose"". But it does fit, and I'd definitely buy again.  The right side cell pocket holds my Samsung Note 4 in its TPU protective case, leaving about 1/2"" of the phone peeking out the top of the pocket, convenient to reach for when needed, yet secure. The look passes easily for business casual (probably why they're always out of Golden Khaki, and have good sales on 'Mushroom').  And the comfort and strength of the fabric means it'll be around for a while."
5.0,"My husband wears these for work and they hold up really well in comparison to other cheaper options that last only a few months.  They are slightly baggy, but he says they move really well and with his job that is very physically active, movement is a must.  Definitely worth the money."
5.0,"My favorite pair of work pants. Durable and comfortable. I'm 6'3 and these were perfect for me at 34x34, which is rare when you have long legs."
5.0,"Love these pants so far, I mostly wanted the cell phone pocket, hate have my phone in my front or back pocket"
5.0,Definitely pleased with product. Company super efficient
4.0,"Comfortable pants, lot of room to move."
5.0,"I work outside almost everyday in humid Northern Florida. If you work outside, get these pants and never wear jeans again. They are super comfortable have a generous fit. Again, if they can make it down here in the summer they can work anywhere. Stop sweating and upgrade. Great price. I never write reviews but I had to on these pants. Thanks Carrhart"
4.0,I'd say that they run 1.5 inches smaller on the waist and 1 inch short in length.
5.0,I typically wear a 34 length (which is what I ordered) but these are just a little longer than expected. I would order another pair of these in a 33 length and I think they would be good.
2.0,"I love the Carhartt , some haw this particular  doesn't fit will . I looking to purchases more on the deferent brand thanks your costumer JLOPES"
5.0,i love it
3.0,fit seems off
5.0,Nice pants not as heavy as regular Carhart good for summer.
5.0,"Great pants. A bit thinner than the duck pants, perfect during the hotter months."
5.0,
4.0,"Good comfy pants , long days at work I'm hard on clothes  , if I get a year out of it I'm happy , and I get my year?"
5.0,"I hate to admit it but I used to wear skinny jeans. But i have found the light! These jeans are comfortable and can take a beating. Ive taken them hunting, shootingand camping dozens of times. No wearing or tears. Fair warning it looks weird if you ware your carheart jacket the same color."
4.0,"I love Carhartt pants; they're comfortable and mostly long wearing. However I'm disappointed that I can only find my size under the men's sizes. I know Carhartt carries womens jeans but the quality just isn't the same and they don't seem to go any larger than a 38"" hip. I'm willing to pay brand name prices for these because I know they're durable but is it too much to ask to take the mens carpenter pants and add a little bit of ease in the hip? Leave everything else the way it is but just make it easier for women to wear. Either that or make mens and womens sizing the same by putting the waist, hip and inseam in inches in the description instead of a single vague, arbitrary number."
3.0,"Not nreally permanent press, very wrinkled coming out of deyer"
4.0,Fits right. A little long but about right to size. Material seems thin compared to competitors or older carhartt products. A plus is they are nice and light and the phone pocket fits an iphone6
5.0,Very nice
5.0,Awesome pants fit well awesome features with the rip stop fabric!
4.0,Sturdy and actually look real good. Can't go wrong with carthartt products.
5.0,thanks
4.0,Nice fit. I love it
3.0,Fit was to tight in the waste
5.0,Comfortable and look nice
4.0,"love these pants, good work pants or to wear casually. they do fit small so whatever your waist size is go up about 2 sizes."
4.0,"Have several pairs because the pocket design is what I want. Wear a little easy, but maybe I'm a little hard on them."
2.0,"Two stars because I've owned and currently own multiple pairs of Carhartt pants over many years and these run small in the waist. I cannot wear them without undue discomfort therefore are worthless to me. I don't understand why the same company would vary in size? I have heard of this happening with other brands needless to say, a review is a review, just that. Furthermore I own other brands in the same size with no problem for fit and comfort. These are actually waste size 32"" or possibly smaller not 33"" Loose Fit Canvas Carpenter Five Pocket pants. Other than that no complaints, they're pants."
5.0,Great price for a great item
5.0,finer
5.0,Just what I needed. Great pants.
5.0,Great pear of pants for the office or mill
3.0,Not to size ordered. I have other carharts that size and they fit fine these are tight in the waste.
4.0,the inseam seems to be a bit longer than past purchases.
3.0,I need to return them for a larger size
1.0,"These pants fit as expected which is a miracle in itself.  Hard to find 35"" waist.  Will be ordering more in the future."
5.0,"Great work pants!  Thanks! They fit great and do the job!  Excellent customer service, fast shipping too!"
5.0,They are comfortable and hold up well.
5.0,"Bought one pair for my husband who is a landscaper, he loved them! We bought another pair."
3.0,I fit in a size 40 on all other oants however Carhartt pants always run small
5.0,Great work pants for summer time heat. Nice and light!
4.0,GREAT PANTS
5.0,"They fit very well, and are loose enough for larger thighs. The cell phone-sized pocket is a really handy feature, and the wide openings at the bottom to cover boots are nice as well.

The canvas feels durable, and the stitches appear to be strong and well done. I would expect these pants to hold up well over a long period of time and use. I was deciding between these and the Columbia ROC II pants, and have been very happy with these so far."
4.0,Yes fit well and comfortable.
5.0,Great product
4.0,Nice pants will have to see how long they last
5.0,I ordered these for my husband who loves Carhartt brands.  He wears Carhartt daily but needs something lighter during the summer months.  I have been looking for something other than the standard colors and these were perfect plus he loves the lose fit and carpenter style.
5.0,Happy with the fit and look!!
3.0,"Love Carhartt products for my husband, but these pants weren't what we expected. They were too tight in the waist, not loose fit at all. I returned them for a different Carhartt style pants. Got my fingers crossed they'll fit my husband the way he wants them to."
5.0,great pants! fit amazingly very comfortable and durable!
5.0,"These pants fit like they should. They are durable enough, but not if you're working on your knees a lot. I like the khakis because they look sort of dressed up for those times the CEO comes to town. The right side leg pocket is large enough to hold my iPhone 6 with a metal Verus case securely."
5.0,"Love them durable, comfortable.. I guess sizes run alittle big though.

Will defiantly buy again"
5.0,"If you want good work pants, buy carharrt."
5.0,Just as described
5.0,Excellent fit and regular Carhart quality
5.0,"Couldn't find the ""loose"" fit in the store. Fit perfect."
4.0,"Amazing fit and look. Very comfortable.  Only drawback is they are easily wrinkled. Solution is to add extra water to them after wash,  smooth out wrinkles,  fold,  then throw them in the dryer facing their tumbling direction. It's an annoying process,  but they are easily my favorite pants."
4.0,great
3.0,"Material is good. I always wear a 31x34 Levi 505, which is what I ordered. They were way too long. I tried washing them since they're 100% cotton and they did shrink length-wise, but are still a good 2"" longer than my Levi's. They are also definitely baggy."
3.0,"We're picky about work clothing and have been using Carhartt for years.
Why do these not fit true to size? They are a little small in the waist, necessitating an unbuttoned top button for comfort.
The next larger size would probably be too large.
Not sure if this is a fluke. But don't have time to go through the exchange routine.
*sigh*"
5.0,Love these pants for work. I'm and engineer in a manufacturing company. These pants are comfortable and a little more dress-y than jeans. That's why I have 4 pair!!!
5.0,"Very comfortable and fit well. Durable material should hold up to daily work wear. I did have to order a 30 length when I normally wear a 32 in every other pant Ive bought. Ive found Carhart's sizing to be a llittle difficult at times, I tried them at my local Carhart store before ordering."
5.0,Perfect
3.0,It's a little tighter than I expected.  I wear 36x36 of Carhartt's Loose Fit jeans and that fits perfectly.  These 36x36 Loose Fit Carpenter pants are a little too tight.  I'm not going to return it.  I'm planning on getting skinnier anyways.  So at least I'll have something to wear then.
3.0,"I think the pair that I received
are irregular because the outer
right leg seem crosses over my
right shin. I therefore have to use
those pants strictly to mess them
up! I also paid full price for that
defect. The ones pictured on the
Model look perfect."
1.0,"Too small. Did not fit. In fact, I sent it back."
5.0,These are the best work pants ever.
5.0,would use again
3.0,Definitely order a size or even two sizes up
5.0,Carhartt makes the best work pants. Period
5.0,Good pants. Just make sure to go up one size on the waist. For some reason the canvas carhartts always run small in the waist
2.0,The pants that I was wearing for work all day was 44 X 30.  When got home tried these on.  Could not even get the button close enough on the waist to fasten.  The length of the pant leg almost covered my foot.  Pants were marked 44 X 30!  And do not know how ended up with these.  Was looking for the cargo pants.  The pants did seem to fit in thighs and hips but can not say for sure as was not able to get buttoned to bend and squat.  Needed for my work.  Was first pair of Carhartt pants I had tried.
2.0,Nice plants but they run small and shrink incredibly.
5.0,Carhardt is always high quality
2.0,I have a handful of Carhartt pants in several different styles. I have two pairs in this style. All of them fit consistently.  I tried to replace my worn out charcoal loose fit 5 pocket canvas carpenter jeans and received a pair that was far too small through the waist.  I returned them and ordered a replacement and got another pair that was far too small. What do I do? Is it just this style that has shifted sizes? is it just this color? This is a huge pain in the butt.  I need to replace my favorite worn out pants and this too much work.
3.0,"These run small.  I typically wear 32"" jeans with a belt and found the 32"" waste to be too small.  They taper up towards the waste quite a bit which makes them run small."
5.0,This was a gift
4.0,Nice pants. If your into that sort of thing.
2.0,"The material, quality, and construction is all great, however I've had to buy three different pairs all the same size to get one that fit right.  I wear a 34x30 and first pair the waist was waaay to tight, second pair waste was perfect, length was too short, and third pair fits just right.  Love them when I find ones that fit, but easier to buy them in store so you can try on  multiple pairs"
4.0,"I didn't realize how loose ""loose"" meant. Waist and hips fit good but the legs don't taper even a little. They feel too roomy, like having your legs in paper bags. If they have them in a straight leg I'd prefer that. Quality is top notch though. If you can confirm these haven't been dyed in anything containing formaldehyde or any other known toxins I'd give them a 5."
3.0,Nice pants but size runs smaller than Carhartt jeans.  I ordered Carhartt jeans along with these and the jeans fit fine but these are too small.
1.0,Too small in the waist. Order one size bigger
5.0,I wear these pants at work because they are comfortable and fit me better than the uniform pants that we are issued.
5.0,These are the ideal pants.
1.0,Sizing is a mess with Carhartt pants. Both waist and length are off and can be either too large or too small. After trying three different pairs I gave up.
4.0,"Great fit, great wear, and great for work and play."
5.0,I'll never go back to denim. These are much more durable than any blue jeans. It was awkward getting used to how they sit kind of low on the hips but they're the perfect work pants for me now.
4.0,"I got the 32 Waist x 34 Length.  I'm 5' 11"" 170 lbs and it fits me great but the ideal size probably would have been 33 waist just for alittle breathing room.  Look great too, love the gray color."
1.0,"it is the same model number as the pair I own, but the material is thinner and the waist size is smaller.  They should be identical,"
5.0,Great pants. Fits perfectly.
5.0,It's the only pants I will buy and haven't purchased any other brands in the last 10 years!
5.0,"Great pants, but run small."
2.0,2 pairs of pants same size one fits good the other to small
5.0,Excellent pair of pants
5.0,great
5.0,"Perfect fit from the start. I like the subtle design of the cargo pockets that are a bit more to the rear of the leg and less obvious as other cargo pocket pant designs which gives the pants a sleeker and dressier look. The material feels rugged without being overly stiff -- a good compromise. Nice moss color, too."
5.0,Great product as expected. Great product as expected.
3.0,"I bought these pants to wear something not like regular casual ""khaki"" pants, but also similar to jeans but not blue. I chose the charcoal color. The material seems sturdy, but as expected, the pockets are not deep and spacious. Trying to get something out of the front pockets feels awkward. The so-called cellular phone pocket is large enough to stick a phone encased in an Otter Box, but I would prefer not to carry it in a leg pocket without a button or zipper. It doesn't completely conceal the phone."
5.0,Good fit
4.0,Too long
5.0,"what you would expect from carhart. comfortable, breathes good, looks good"
3.0,"I ordered 32x32, which is the size for all my other pants including one from carhart I bought at the same time. It fit more like a 30x32; the waist was too tight and the length was appropriate. I have exchanged for 33x32 and will see how it fits. The material feels good, and I anticipate these lasting me for a while on work sites."
1.0,Size is not the same get two size bigger
5.0,"Perfect fit, nice and comfortable. Great cell phone pocket to boot (iPhone 6s) fits a little loose which I like."
3.0,I had to take the jeans to a tailor  to be fitted correctly.
4.0,Nice quality!
4.0,"I've been wearing Carhartt Carpenter pants for years, and have always been happy with the fit and durability."
5.0,As advertised
2.0,"Not too pleased with product I use them for work and they seem to attract dirt and anything else you make work with such as insulation dust,etc.not easily dusted off like denim they also wrinkle very easily and make them less attractive,I like the fit and comfort,if possibly made from different fabric like denim or similar would be perfect."
4.0,"My hope is that with the Canvas rather than the twill these will last a little longer.  Have the twill pant and while very comfortable were not as durable.  These should be a good addition to my work wardrobe for winter when a heavier pant is needed.  will still wear the twill in the Summer, as these may cause some unnessesary uncomfortablity with the weight of the fabric"
5.0,5*!
4.0,I am always satisfied with my orders
5.0,This was tough they almost fit as expected but they are a bit loose at the waist. The quality is excellent as expected from Carhartt.
4.0,Great pants
4.0,Great looking pants but was bigger than I thought.
5.0,Very easy care and durable lite comfortable
5.0,Great fit !!
5.0,My huhusband loves them the only problem is they are a tab bit longer than most pants that are 32 in length
5.0,MY HUSBAND LOVES THE PANTS. THEY ARE JUST WHAT HE NEEDED. HE WORKS OUTSIDE SO HE LOVES CARHARTTS
3.0,they are a little short for being sold as 36x34.
3.0,SO far so good. I have washed them now like 4 to 5 times and they have a smell to them. Maybe it's just me. I'm going to try the Dickies because they cost 10 to 12 less. Lower the price on these and I will buy more.
5.0,My husband loves these jeans.  He is very rugged on his clothes and these seem to be the only ones that hold up well.
5.0,Love em. Perfect in the Arizona heat.
4.0,"Well constructed, good material, nice loose fit through the legs and rear. Only wish they were flared more for boots."
4.0,Good pants
4.0,I love Carhartts. They are the only pants I buy for work but these are not my favorite. The waist is a much tighter fit and the legs are really baggy. I look like MC Hammer in them. I bought 3 pairs in one color and two pairs in another color and they all fit the same. At least they are consistent I guess. Other than that they are of good quality material and made well.
5.0,super nice and very comfortable and they fit well great work pants and casual pants.
5.0,Great work pants.
5.0,Must order a size up. They run a little small
5.0,great
5.0,"Fit just a tad bit snug compared to most 36x32s but still fits well enough. Definitely recommend, great pants, great quality, fast shipping"
4.0,Fit as expected. He really likes them!
5.0,Love these pants!
5.0,"My husband was very pleased with these pants, he is 6'0 and weighs about 190 - so a 36/30 fit him great! Carhartt has great products and these pants did not disappoint."
5.0,Just what I've come to expect from carhartt. Little bit more slim in the legs but still good to go!
5.0,"Carhartt makes the best pants for working that I've ever found. I use these for yard work, as well as any moving/lifting/etc that tears up nice jeans. My first pair of these lasted about 6 years and are finally wearing through, and I'm betting these will last even longer. Great pants!"
5.0,"These are the best work pants ever.  My boys, age ranges teen to twenty-something to hubby, wear these for work and camping.  The material is sturdy and washes very well.  I do not use dryer sheets, as they can damage clothing.  These pants last forever and take a beating!  Hubby does alot of work on his knees, so after several months, the knees do wear out and rip, so it's patch time and they last and last and last.  They offer great protection when hiking through brush or working in the woodshop or with tools.  I highly recommend this brand.  The fit is really comfy too - who wants tight work pants that you can't bend in?  They're not baggy even tho they're loose fit.  They're just right!  You won't be sorry."
2.0,At first the pants were great. They fit perfectly and were comfortable. Now almost 6 months later they have shrunk to the point that I cannot wear them anymore. I'm really bummed because I was hoping they'd last for a few years.
2.0,Too baggy and too long in size 42 waist 32 long. I have returned them. Could not find same item in a more traditional fit.
5.0,Pants arrived in good packaging. Fit well according to chart. Look good feel good nice and loose easy to work in.
3.0,Dickies fit better. No more Carhart for me
3.0,"I normally wear a 36 size waist and they said it ran a bit small so ordered a pair of 38 thinking it would give me a bit of room, they were kinda tight and they fit snug"
5.0,To small
4.0,"Only getting a 4 star rating due to the waist fitting a little tight. The length was fine though. I typically wear a 34"" waist in jeans, but the reviews said it fit somewhat small so I bought it in a 35"" waist to be safe, but it is just a little too snug. Next time I'll buy a 36"" waist. Other than that I have no complaints, feels and looks great everywhere else."
4.0,lovely
4.0,"They are just a little tight in the waist.  Overall, love the material and color."
5.0,Waist is slightly smaller then expected but still a good fit. Length is good with enough room for my work boots. Still very high quality pants.
2.0,said 34waist but more like 33 for sure
5.0,I love it.
5.0,Love these pants!
2.0,These run small.  May husband wears a 38x36 and he couldn't even button these.
5.0,Most comfortable.surprisingly more so than dungarees
5.0,Not as stiff as other pants from Carhartt. Great color!
4.0,I like these jeans a lot. I own 4 pair now. I wish I could find this style in a little less canvas feeling material. That is the only thing I would change.
5.0,Good bye
5.0,Excellent pants at a great price.  Fits perfectly and held up well after washing and drying.
4.0,this brand always runs small
4.0,They fit fine for me and meet the needs of the work I do.
5.0,Perfect fit. Very comfortable.
1.0,Small at waist and huge everywhere else. B151 fit alot better
3.0,product quality was good...but the waist was too small for me.
5.0,Great work pants
5.0,I like the loose fit better than the relaxed fit. Waist size was perfect. I don't see how so many people mention in they're reviews to buy larger waist size. I recommend you buy your normal pants size.
4.0,purchased as a gift and he said all was good.
4.0,Very nice fit and comfortability for work pants.
5.0,Great!
4.0,Little more baggy than I expected but other than that they are very comfortable.
2.0,"I've had other carhartt pants usually a size 32. Those fit pretty good but we're starting to feel a little tight after washing. So I ordered these in a 33 and before washing them they are tighter than my 32s?!? Worst part is, because I already ripped off the tags assuming they would fit fine like my other ones I can't return them..."
5.0,Fit as expected!
5.0,"Great fit and durable fabric.
 I love the cell phone pocket."
5.0,Nice pants  just what we expected
5.0,Great work and casual pants.  My only thought is that the gray color can fade somewhat quickly if you work on your knees a lot as I do.
5.0,LOVE these pants!!!
5.0,Please.
5.0,Fit well
1.0,"Tried twice. Started with my size of 32/32, way too small in the waist, got a 34/32. Still too small. 36 would have been too big... I give up."
1.0,"These are not the old Canvas pants Carhartt used to make!!
I've been wearing Carhartt canvas pants about 20-years. These pants are not the same by a long shot. The pants have a very thin material and the thread in the seams was a different color than the pant! That made it look like I was wearing stripe's and the pockets highlighted. ""Totally Ridiculous""

Sadly my old canvas pants are seeing the end of their days, and now I think Carhartt has too, for me anyway. Low quality & higher prices have ruined an age-old name. Immediately returned them for a refund...
.
I do not recommend buying these pants!!"
5.0,Great
3.0,These are too small.  How I send them back and get a bigger pair??
5.0,Was excited to get a hard to find size and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Good fit
4.0,Run a little large but for work so he is fine with them.
4.0,Just as i was hoping. Fits just right
1.0,Very unhappy with the purchase
5.0,Good
5.0,Great item
5.0,I had a pair prior to this pair and literally worn them until I had holes in the knees.  The fit is exactly what I had expected.  Also a very durable paint.
5.0,"Everything carhartt is so nice. It's always the best quality and durability. Super nice pants, i perfer this material over dikies or jeans anyday. and they look good. True to size, not large or small, don't assume because its Carhartt it will be big. Totally worth 40$."
5.0,love them
5.0,"comfortable, tough and help keep the cold out. I love them. I wear them pretty much everyday to work as a construction manager."
5.0,Great fit
4.0,"Great pants, slightly loser fit and thinner material than traditional Carhartt pants.  Very nice for more casual wear."
5.0,"Great. Wearing them right now. Comfortable and solid. Wore them to work in as a teacher, but they will start being used for work outdoor pants. I might even like them more than my Riggs pants, which I really like."
3.0,I had ordered the exact size that my son-in-law already had but these were too small and I had to return for the next larger size. The new pants were fine but wish the sizing was more consistent.
5.0,"Exactly what my husband wanted, but cheaper than in the store. Great pants. He wears them everyday to work(as a carpenter)"
5.0,Love these!
5.0,I love these pants. They fit a iPhone perfect and look good too.
5.0,very good quality. Ill be able to really beat these up
5.0,"Awesome pants... Recommended, and will buy again."
5.0,Great
3.0,ok
5.0,Great pants! Comfortable and lightweight but durable!
5.0,Nice
5.0,These are my favorite work pants! Light weight and very durable
3.0,"Pants run smaller in the waist, just go up a size. Comfortable to work in. My only issue with these are after the dryer they need to be ironed every time, these wrinkle like crazy."
5.0,Good quality and plenty of extra pockets.
1.0,Ordered a 34X30.  They ended up being 30X34.  The legs are HUGE and you can fit both your legs in one of the pant legs.
5.0,Perfect work pants. They even have a cell phone pocket on the leg. Awesome.
5.0,great pants!
5.0,Margaret..  need I say more?
3.0,"not true to size, did not fit."
5.0,"Carhart is always a great purchase.  Delivery by UPS was not great, but with no other options offered you're stuck."
4.0,Pretty good. The only problem is that this is not really a jeans. It really wrinkles quickly and requires ironing daily
4.0,"The blue is... very uniform style. I feel like a policeman or nurse whenever I wear these. They are starting to fade a bit now, but same good quality and build."
3.0,Love these pants but sizing was way off. Waist was way too tight and inseam was way too long.
5.0,Husband's favorite work pants
5.0,Product runs longer
3.0,"Nice pants just a little baggy, when I put these on my wife says ""what up gangsta"" to me lol I love them just wish they fit better also I bought a 42""30"
5.0,Fit great
5.0,Looks good
5.0,great pants
5.0,Great work pants
2.0,"Rough and fabric is too crisp, for a lack of better words. Not comfortable at all. Have washed and worn several times, going to donate to goodwill."
1.0,Totally mis-sized.  Love brand but who is in charge of sizing?  Tired of having to return 75% of Carhartt orders.
5.0,well made
5.0,Live in these. All winter.
5.0,Great product and fast shipping.
5.0,"I ordered the size that I normally wear as far as jeans go, 35/34.  I'm 6-1, 210 labs and they fit great.  I've worn the s&*t out of these things already and have not been disappointed yet.  The pockets are deep enough to fit my hands up to the wrists and the back pockets fit my wallet well.  The thigh pockets are just the right size to fit my cell phone (iPhone 5) with a slightly bulky case on it.  The pants feel good and look pretty good too.  I have gotten all kinds of crap on them and they seem to wash well.  Dried joint compound came right off with my fingernail and the residue washed right out.  They don't wrinkle too bad and I haven't had any shrinkage from the wash yet.  The bottoms fit right over all the boots and shoes that I've worn with them without any bunching at the hems, but the cuffs aren't so big that they drag on the ground behind the shoe either.  I will definitely purchase one or two more pairs if these start to fall apart, but I don't have a feeling that they will anytime soon."
4.0,"I ordered my normal size, and it ran small. Still a great product"
5.0,Best work pants ever. I use them all year round.
3.0,"These pants run small, period,"
4.0,"Very comfortable and well made. Like the heavy material, deep pockets, and the xtra pockets."
5.0,Great pants all around.  No complaints.
5.0,Very nice fit. 34x36 fit me well. I'm 6'4 208 lbs. Comfortable pants. Not super heavy duty however. Just right for regular work pants.
5.0,Would be looser fit if I lost a few pounds. Lol
5.0,"I own three pairs of these pants and have been wearing them for years instead of regular Levis. They're rugged, attractive and fit great. I couldn't be happier."
5.0,good quality
5.0,"I tried them on, and they fit good....."
4.0,"""Slightly, on the small side."""
5.0,Everything was perfect and delivery was earlier than expected at time of order.
5.0,"I, a woman, love the fit of these jeans!  The lower rise is much more comfortable, and all the pockets are very handy.  This is my 2nd pair of these -- the 1st pair had just the right amount of Loose Fit (loose, but not baggy), so had to get another."
5.0,Excellent fit!
4.0,love 'em.
4.0,"Great Pant except the length is suppose to be 32 and they puddle at the floor.  :( not happy about that, now I have to get them altered."
5.0,Had to exchange my 38x36 back for fitting somewhat small.. I was sent 40x34  which fit very nicely
4.0,"Great pants, but I either put on a few or the waist is just a tad smaller than expected.  I'd recommend ordering one size larger in the waist for good measure."
5.0,Great
5.0,"Love these pants for work. Bought 4 pairs, have lasted 3 months so far."
5.0,great
4.0,"These were a little long.  I used the tag on a pair I had and bought these online - using these measurements.  They came in about 1"" too long."
5.0,Good
4.0,"Good fit, bit on a thinner side - material, compared to the other Carhart pants I have. Actually going to order couple of these right now."
4.0,"I love the fit, comfortable, and enough pocket space for my type of work."
5.0,Look great and fits perfectly. Very comfortable and practical pair of pants. I would probably buy a light color next time though since mine seem to attract white lint.
5.0,Nice pants. Wear well and fit nice.
5.0,My husband loves these pants.  He says they are like a thin cotton duck.  He got two pairs one in navy and the other in mushroom.  They look great too.
2.0,Very tight waist. Didn't fit into what I typically fit into - runs very small.
5.0,Work pants for my husband look good and sturdy
2.0,"This item fits very nicely around the waist. However, the length was supposed to be 30"" and is much longer than stated. Somewhat disappointing as we do not have time to send them back."
5.0,Excellent.
5.0,Ran a little small but other then that they are perfect!
5.0,Great pants
5.0,love it
5.0,"I ordered these 4 1/2 years ago and, sadly, today I had to lay them to rest. Shift work in the paper mill was a hard life, and now they're done. Good thing I ordered 6 more pair to share the load."
5.0,Perfect fit. Very nice quality
5.0,Good Quality and lightweight. Comfortable
5.0,it is hard for a fat man like me to find good quality pants that fit and these fit great so thank you !!
5.0,"Fairly lightweight pair of pants, meaning light in weight not quality, good for warmer weather.  Side pocket will fit an Apple Iphone 6 plus smartphone, but a little tight."
5.0,Fit great. Like'm.
5.0,These pants are great. My husband works in construction are very durable.
5.0,I tend to need a slightly more generous cut in the legs than most pants that fit my waist would give. The loose fit Carpenter pants fit very well. I'm only wearing them to work around the house so they are plenty durable for my needs.
5.0,"Carhartt makes some great pants, but for me their fit is really tricky. Some of their pants ride up too high on the waist. Some are too tight if you have big thighs like me. These B159 loose fit seem to be the best fitting of all for me. I like the material of these pants - they are canvas, but feel more like smooth denim. And best of all, they are classy enough to wear to work, yet durable enough to wear while doing yard clean up.

One tip - always order one inseam size longer than you normally would, because with all Carhatt products, they shrink a lot after repeated washing & drying!!"
4.0,"Nicely made pants that fit true to size. For someone in construction, frequently crawling around doing hard labor, they hold up fairly well. I have had to use some patches on the knees occasionally, but all in all Carhartt offers some good  quality products."
4.0,"The description states:  Loose Fit - and that is what these pants are.  They fit perfectly as expected.  Lots of room to work in them and be comfortable.  This is my 2nd pair.  For work, I love these - feels like the loose coveralls without the bib and the suspenders."
5.0,The pants were just the right fit.
4.0,"My husband really likes pants, but he is a huge Carhartt fan.  The only complaint that I have is that the color fades faster than I would appreciate.  Otherwise, these are an excellent work pant."
3.0,"I am a fairly skinny guy, and very tall as well so it is hard for me to find pants. The pants fit fairly well around the waist, but I just felt like they were too baggy in the leg. I know that they are loose fit, but to me they just felt too loose. I loved the material feel and the 5th pocket is great for carrying around a multitool or just for extra pocket space."
5.0,Fits perfect and excellent quality
5.0,"Since I started wearing these I don't ever see myself going back to jeans. I have 4 different pairs of these plus 2 in the older style and fabric. The pants are tough and stand up well, very practical to wear, and the pockets are great for my every day carry items."
5.0,Great work pants
5.0,Got these for my son to ride trails on his dirt bike. He loved them said they wore great for his rugged trip.
5.0,Soft and broken in feeling out of the package.  Lightweight pants good for warmer weather working.
5.0,Only pants my husband will wear to work!!
5.0,"Great fit, they seem pretty similar to the canvas work pant.  The legs are pretty roomy but they're still ""stylish"" enough to wear to work or around town.

This material is almost identical to the canvas work pant and is substantially thinner/lighter than the washed duck, although still quite durable."
5.0,It's a good quality pair of pants
4.0,"I love Carharrt's quality, but for some reason each color pant fits differently even though they are the same model.

UPDATE: I contacted Carhartt about the sporadic size differences for the same model (but different color). The representative was very friendly and helpful. They offed to inspect the pants and if there is an issue they will replace with new. If you want to send them back to corporate make sure you have all the details. Size, Model, Color that you will be sending back to them.

From experience the darker the color the tighter the fit. I don't know why this is."
5.0,great pants just too long. Needed shorter in legs
5.0,Got these for my husband; I will be replacing all his jeans with these. Said they are better than any of his pants!
5.0,Excellent fit!
4.0,Very comfortable.  Like the cell phone pocket
5.0,These pants are the best ones that I've owned for my landscaping job. They offer the proper protection and they damn near fit perfectly. Recommend.
5.0,Legs are way baggy but waist fits as expected
1.0,Too thin.
5.0,Fit great and are comfortable
4.0,"Fit is true to size, Carhartt always has quality products."
5.0,Great fit and color as shown.
5.0,My hubby loves them and they fit perfectly!
4.0,"Only qualm is I couldn't find my size (32x34) so went a size up on the waist, still fits decent though, and it's a nice weight fabric."
4.0,"The fit is great and exactly as expected.  I just wish that they sold other pants with the ""loose fit"" style."
5.0,"I work in an office, but we occasionally move heavy equipment around and visit industrial spaces. I like Carhartt since they are rugged yet look more ""professional"" than jeans. Ordered one pair in 38x34 which fit perfectly. Ordered three more in different colors, and all were a great fit."
5.0,Fantastic pants. They fit great and they're rugged for construction site work. Awesome.
5.0,Excellent
2.0,does not fit as expected
5.0,"Carhartt pants are great, sturdy and comfortable."
4.0,Runs long
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,Best pants ever! Too bad this model was discontinued by Carhartt.
2.0,Tight around the thigh
5.0,"Great fit, delivered on time."
5.0,Good pants for carpenter
5.0,Fit great. They have been durable thus far. As expected from a quality name
1.0,It makes no sense at all. I have always used and still buy 32x34. Tried the pants iy barely fits me. Really disappointed.
4.0,"Seems like people tend to think these pants run smallish ... they seemed fairly normal to me.  And the Amazon return policy is so easy, if you do need to exchange them, it's no problem.  The waist is a little higher than I expected; nothing too dramatic, just a little different.  Nice casual pants."
5.0,Great pair of work pants. Has few key pockets for a few tools and a hammer holster. Great overall but run alittle smaller.
4.0,"A miss-order that I'm super happy with! Thought I was ordering the denim version, and am much happier with these. Better style and just dressy enough. Would be five stars if they made the double knee in these pants."
5.0,"Very happy, great fit"
5.0,Great
4.0,I can't give a proper review as i couldn't even get the pants over my bum.  However. I will give a 4 star rating because i know Carhartt makes quality clothing.
5.0,Son liked the fit. I will reserve opinion depending on the way they wear.
5.0,good quality product. reasonable price.
5.0,Good comfortable pants.
4.0,Fits as it should. Light yet sturdy pants. Have several pairs. Great for work as they are not too hot and heavy.
4.0,"I really like these pants.  My only issue: in the past carhartt pants have had issues shrinking lengthwise, I usually ordered a 36"" inseam and expected them to shrink down to 34"".  I did that with these pants and they did not shrink at all in the inseam so they are a bit long.  Other than that these are great pants.  Comfortable and durable."
4.0,"I've been wearing  this model (159) of carhartt for several years. Like the fit, like the pockets."
5.0,Very pleased
5.0,Fit right and seem like they'll be good work pants.
5.0,Good quality as always.
5.0,Durable work pants
5.0,Love them
5.0,My husband loves these
5.0,"good stuff. us made or chinee made don't matter none.

it still good stuff. and i have sears with a lousy selection......so hoorah to amazon!"
1.0,The size was supposed to be 31x32 but was 33x32
4.0,Love these jeans. After a few washes they are the softest and easily the most comfortable I've ever worn. But they aren't the strongest. They tend to rip out on the front thighs after several months. These are the only jeans I have that do that.
4.0,great pants
5.0,"Being a customer for many years, you know what to expect from Carhartt, and you get it!"
5.0,excellent as usual for carhartt
5.0,"Quick shipping, good price, happy customer."
1.0,Run Way too amall
5.0,"Great looking, durable work pants for my millwright man!"
4.0,"Love the look and love the product, but they are just a bit smaller than I expected."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised. These pants are so nice that they could be worn into a managerial meeting and then walk outside and frame some walls. I really like them.
4.0,Just what I was looking for
5.0,"Fit is great, material is a medium weight, so it is durable for Spring and Fall weather."
5.0,"These are great summer work pants. I have two pairs of 38 waist but the longer I wash them, they get slightly smaller.  So ordered a size 40, I need a belt but really like the extra room.  I would recommend ordering one size larger than you usually wear."
5.0,Love these pants...so comfortable.
4.0,Very happy product
5.0,40 waist was a bit tight. Could be my fault. :0
5.0,Great pants
4.0,"Good pants, size large"
4.0,A little small for the size 34 waist
5.0,"Excellent, love these pants!"
5.0,"Great pair or pants, comfortable and good looking pants, I like the pockets."
5.0,Love them
5.0,Pants fit perfect. Durable and comfortable.
4.0,Good
5.0,Husband loves them!
5.0,Very comfortable and well made.
5.0,My son loves these!
5.0,This was a good choice.
3.0,"Bought these pants for work. I wear a 33x32 for most everything. These pants are way big in the legs, the waist is too big and they're too long. I thought they would shrink up a bit but they didn't. If I had to buy these again I'd go with a smaller size because these ended up being too baggy on me. They've been in fairly consistent use and are now starting to wear out after about a year. Overall, they're good pants but I would definitely order the next size down. Others have said they run big or run small so go try them on in a store before purchasing. Carhartt stuff seems to have a lot variation in it's sizing."
5.0,No
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants. I work with 20 to 40 dog's regularly and these pants hold up to everything. That includes muddy paws and catching nails. They are extremely comfortable while kneeling or squatting too. If I had the money, I would buy 3 of each color."
2.0,Hard to buy certain items and brands online. These pants would qualify.
5.0,great fit very durable
5.0,"These are great work pants!! And so  convenient To order online but, I tried a pair on before I ordered more. Very happy with them!"
3.0,prefer relaxed fit
5.0,Works great for my note 4.
5.0,Fit my brother well
5.0,"Fit well, feel better"
5.0,"Fit perctly my husband who is 6'1"" and 230 lbs.  These pants have a nice loose fit on the legs.  Nice enough to go out too."
5.0,Excellent quality
5.0,"I have a hard time finding pants that fit. Often they are way to tight through the thighs so I have to go up in the waist to get pants that fit. These had plenty of room for my big legs to fit!  And they are good looking too!  I'm 6'4"" 280#s"
5.0,These pants are durable and fit great.  They last a long time and are very well made.
2.0,"I have purchased other Carharrt products that were exceptionally well made and study.  These pants fall short.  The material is not wearing very well and the zipper has a bad tooth after only wearing them once.  I do like the pocket for the phone.  My 6+ fits great.
Dissappointing."
5.0,Great fit...Good quality...Ordering one more pair...
5.0,My boyfriend loves these. I'm going to order him more!
3.0,"its ok, i like it"
5.0,"Excellent fit, quality material, fast shipping.  Will get again."
5.0,Fit perfect
5.0,Couldn't ask for a better pair of working jeans !!!!!!
5.0,As promised no problems
3.0,The loose fit is a little baggy on me. I would prefer a casual fit
4.0,"Love em, but after 2 months there's already holes in the knees. Super comfortable though."
5.0,Great deal. Arrived in 2 days free shipping. Fit perfect
5.0,Best looking most comfortable casual / work pants I have ever owned.  They are light and keep cool on hot days.  I plan to add several to my closet.  Great product.
5.0,Great pants fit as expected!
5.0,Great
5.0,They were a little tight in the waist
5.0,"I've ordered additional pairs of these.  You can get them here with a 35"" waist - no where else for selection and value received!  And they're Carhartt's so they're rugged and last a long time."
5.0,The fit was perfect. A lot of pants these days seem to be designed for skinny dudes with scrawny thighs and no butt. The loose fit of these pants makes them among the most comfortable pants I have ever worn.
5.0,"Was looking for work pants lighter, cooler than denim, they are a bit reminiscent of bell bottoms, but much better fit than other Carhart pants I have bought."
5.0,Great purchase....can never go wrong with the Carhartt brand!!
5.0,Comfortable.
5.0,"The quality is good, the price is right"
5.0,I bought these pants for my son and he thinks they're great.
5.0,Fit Fine after one washing. Pleased!
3.0,To bagy
5.0,Great fit as expected
5.0,Great pair of pants
5.0,"great work pants, mid weight for warm weather, good fit, a little thicker than the b151, so they should last a little longer."
2.0,"I bought two pairs of these because I know my exact size which is usually enough to buy without needing to try the pants on.

The first pair I got, Mushroom, were much longer than the listed inseam, I'm stepping on them every step, so either I return or pay for the them to be tailored.

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?  It costs me a lot to have these tailored and they aren't worth it but I need pants and I already lost enough time on this."
5.0,Love these pants for work. Pockets are great for tools. The fabric is rugged enough for work but light enough to be comfortable and cool in temperature.
5.0,Very lite material. Perfect for warmer days. Not the heavy canvasy ( if that's a word ) carhartt material. Run a bit small
5.0,Like the fit good quality.
5.0,"Was actually looking for a slightly different style, similar weight, in an indigo. Beginning to think they don't make that style anymore. These feel terrific."
5.0,Great purchase
5.0,A good summer work pant.
2.0,"I bought this pant, but I recieved it with six pocket and the legs were too big, like a rapper, I don't like this item."
4.0,I like it!
5.0,comfy and fit well.
5.0,great
1.0,To tight
4.0,that u so much for helping me get it right
4.0,Nice pants. A little long for 32 inseam.
4.0,was a little long even though I ordered my usual size. Good quality though as usual from Carhartt !
4.0,Item as described good value nice quality fits well would buy again
5.0,Love these pants for work light for warm days and very comfortable
5.0,To start off I first bought a couple pairs of these for work and they lasted me a couple years which is what I expected. I must say I really am happy with these pants. These fit perfect and exactly how I was expecting them to. only reason I need to buy new ones is because after having them for a year or two a hole started tearing in the crotch.
4.0,"Very good quality. I expected them to shrink a bit in the wash because of the material, but they did not shrink at all. I'll order proper size next time."
1.0,Logo on  shirt has partially worn off after just a few washes.
5.0,Great pants.  True to size listed.
5.0,Nice work pants
5.0,"Excellent pants. I've worked in Levis for 30 years...and I have to say these Carhartts are much more comfortable to work in. The Levis are now saved for weekends, like the rest of the white-collar world :)"
5.0,"Carhartt never lets me down! Great fit, very durable, and not too hot on long days landscaping in the sun."
5.0,"Pats fit great... Have been buying several Carharts pants, however this particular one has been showing a couple of holes on the top leg... maybe the material had a defect...?"
3.0,"3"" too long"
5.0,Fit great!
3.0,"I purhased a size 30 inseam, but they seem much longer. I roll them up."
5.0,Nice paint for the price fast shipping
5.0,Perfect weight for the summer
5.0,They are Carhartts so you get what you expect. Great deal. Came promptly. Good job.
4.0,Good quality
5.0,They were a birthday gift for my son. Carhartt never disappoints.
3.0,"The rise of these pants is incredibly high. Walking was uncomfortable because I couldn't take full steps which made me look like I'd just messed myself. Additionally I need to be able to straddle roof ridges for wok and without hiking these up over my belly button there was no way to accomplish that.

Love the material and Carhartt has such great customer service I hate to complain but if they could cut these like the #101118 jeans that'd be awesome & I'd buy 4-5 pairs and wear them to work every day. So far I've found this to be a problem with Carhartt's products designed for work. Very tight in the pocketed area and very high cut. Different material but basically cut like mom jeans."
2.0,They are OK. Kinda flimsy construction. I've had them for about 6 months and they are already pretty worn. The right thigh pocket re-inforcement gets all bunched up and annoys the crap out of me. I do like the way they fit and the overall design. These are not even close to a pair or arborwear pants or a pair of heavier duty Carhartts though.
5.0,"Fits good, fast delivery"
4.0,Great quality
5.0,Husband only wears these- I buy 6 pairs every summer.
5.0,Great
5.0,Great pant perfect for work
4.0,They sit a little higher than I would like but they are nice pants. I docked them one star for saying they sit a little lower when they still sit fairly high.
4.0,"I needed one size larger, but overall satisfied"
5.0,"My husband loves these pants, so we bought three pair.  He wears them for work as an electrician."
5.0,Very nice. Beautiful product. Fits perfectly. They on appearance look like khaki's but with work horse materials and longevity. Will buy again for my husband.
5.0,"I own 2 pairs of these already, they are my go to pant once the weather starts to warm up and I can shed the coverall.  Awesome hot weather work pant."
5.0,"very comfortable fit and wear as expected, return customer."
5.0,"I love these like all my Carhartts.  I'm glad I listened to other reviewers.  I normally wear a 32/32 or 33/32.  I ordered these in 34/32 and they fit PERFECTLY.  I love the fit, perfect for work.  They are not baggy but definitely plenty roomy for moving around, bending down and getting the job done.  I will definitely be purchasing more of these pants."
5.0,"These pants fit well, and loosen up slightly as they are broken in. They are lightweight but durable. I have worn  them everyday for work for the past few years. I own several colors"
3.0,Good but too small
5.0,I bought 3 pair of these.  Awesome!!!!  My go to  pants from now on.
5.0,Look great. My man wears a 36/30 should've gone 38/30 they shrink a little in dryer
5.0,"I ordered next waist size up per the reviews, fit comfortably.  She may or may not be right..."
5.0,THEY REALLY ARE NICE NOW I AM WAITING TO WASH THEM AND SEE HOW THEY DRY AND HOW MANY WRINKLES.  I WILL LET YOU KNOW.  THANKS
3.0,"I have always worn carharttt. I order 36 x 30, and these are way too tight and short. I would guess they are actually 34 x 28. I will still stick with Carhartt"
4.0,"Just like the others say, it runs small in the waist. I saw this and ordered larger than I normally wear. It still fits too snug for my liking and I need to go up two inches in the waist for comfort - which is going to be almost 3-4 inches above what I wear in other clothes. Also the zipper is not very long so there is not much room for the stuff down there...and I am a very average sized guy but I can tell before washing these pants that we are going to have a problem with the lack of room in the zipper area.
Now the pants look and feel great, nice and light, good length, they are sort of baggy in my opinion but not much at all, just loose fitting. So I will try again with a larger size or try the regular fit."
4.0,Son-in-law loves them.
5.0,AWESOME!  Great pants with a perfect fit for work or play...just bought another pair in a different color
5.0,"Carhartts are sized one size smaller in the waist and one size longer in the leg as compared to jeans. I remembered that, and they fit perfectly."
5.0,"Cant say enough about them, They're quality pants that fit like they should.  I am very pleased."
5.0,"Carhartt is my sportswear of choice for rugged good looking and pants that fit.  When I could not find the style that I wanted in the color I needed I turned to Amazon.  It did not take me long to find what I wanted in the size and color that I needed.  The price was great, the service excellent and when I am in need again I will be coming back."
5.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend, he loves them and they fit him great!"
4.0,Great pants will repurchase
5.0,"These are the only work pants that I buy. They are comfortable, durable and reasonably priced. The extra pockets come in quite handy for my cell phone or tools as needed. They also look good enough for a night out! I recommend these pants!"
5.0,"Great buy, quick shipping !!!"
5.0,Perfect! Husband loves the fit.
5.0,"Very happy, I will be buying more!"
5.0,Very durable and comfortable
5.0,Bought these for my hubby. He loves them and fit perfectly. They are great quality and wash well.
5.0,Great as usual
2.0,I order Carhartt for my husband all the time and this product fits completely different.
5.0,Love them
5.0,I finally had to get another pair. I'd been wearing the same pair for at least 2 days a week for 4 years. I still wear them but just to rough around the feet and stains. I will say that an iPhone 5s with life proof case does fit snug in the cell pocket on new carpenter pants.
5.0,"Great pair of pants, fit good. Wish they were a little but cheaper but you pay for quality"
5.0,"Hubby loves them, and wants more !!"
5.0,Good price! Very pleased with the pants!
5.0,"Every pair of jeans I own is a 40 waist (which for me is about a half size to big) and I like the way they fit. I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead. (A little side note to the big men. I have also found that Wrangler 20X style 33 ""extreme relaxed"" jeans also fit me and my bigger thighs well)"
5.0,My husband is one of the pickiest people I have ever met when it comes to the comfort of his clothes. Whenever he finds something comfortable he buys 5-6 pairs of them. These pants were true to size and my husband says they are extremely comfortable. They look very durable for work. We bought 5 pairs
3.0,"We purchased another pair of Carhartt pants the same style just the more recently sold version and the same size in the store and they fit perfect, these are a little on the smaller side..."
4.0,Great material. We ordered a bit large because previous pants from Carhartt had shrunk. I had to wash & dry on high several times to shrink. Still a bit long in the crotch & legs.
5.0,"Lite, great for warm weather, comfy fit"
4.0,Cool pants but I lost so much money buying Carhartts other garbage that I don't even want em ...
3.0,Same size I have purchased before. These fit larger.
5.0,"Great work pants. Fits exactly as expected. Roomy enough in the seat and the thighs, but not baggy. I'll be ordering more of these for sure."
5.0,Great work pants this is the 4th pair I've purchased for my husband he couldn't be happier with them
3.0,"Ok for casual wear.  Can't see them holding up to everyday outdoor work as they are pretty lightweight.  They were too small in the waist  and zipper would not stay closed, so I am returning them for the next size up.  I have other Carhartt's same size in the Relaxed Fit style that fit perfectly."
5.0,"Just what I expected from Carhartt pants at an awesome price!!  These are at least $15 - $20 cheaper than our Carhartt retail outlet.  They fit just as I expected them too.  I have big legs and have to have a loose fit pant and these are perfect, not baggy and not tight."
5.0,instantly comfortable and easy to wash so far it has been very durable
5.0,"Love these pants. As I've noticed for all Carhartt products, they run small. I normally wear 34's, but in Carhartt 36 is the way to go. They are stiff while being broken in, but they get quite comfy after a few washes. The pockets are huge, in the most excellent way."
5.0,Good work pants
3.0,"Good quality though, I will be ordering a bigger size."
4.0,"The pants are made with thin cloth, don't feel protected"
5.0,Good pants!
5.0,GREAT PANTS.  BUY THEM.
5.0,Very satisfied with this purchase!
4.0,I wear these to work and they fit sort of loose which I find more comfortable for all day use. I got a hole in them somehow in the first week but no issues since then.
3.0,"Very comfortable pants, not stiff like the canvas ones. How ever i own 9 pairs of these pants all the same size and they all fit different some are loose and baggy while others are short and slim their pants size really vary."
5.0,Great transaction - simple & right
5.0,I've purchased these before fit good comfortable and they have high back. Sick of low cut any thing. As a builder you put things in the pockets and pulling your pants up every two seconds gets old. These stay up.
5.0,"Should have bought these before I ever started landscaping. Best pants on Earth. Hold up to anything. Fit incredibly comfortable - no restriction of movement like jeans. I've got muscular legs that normally don't comfortable fit jeans, but these are great without being baggy.

You can wear them for days at work before having to switch to the next pair. I have 3 pairs now and never run out doing laundry once a week. Just hang them up after a day of work and put them right back on the next day with a little dirt on them, but these colors make it hard to see. Once they're noticeably dirty or get wet, I wear the next ones.

Have yet to notice any wear to any of my pairs after a few months of use."
1.0,I was charged $5.00 handling for something I could not use.  They were too small & the material was too thin.  It was a bad experience.
5.0,My favorite work pants
3.0,"Pants look fine but I am done ordering Carhartt pants on-line. Stupid me. I have tried on 3 different occasions now and every time have had to return them. I'm a 33"" waist so ordered 34"". I couldn't get close to buttoning them. I'd probably need 36"" waist for them to fit me. Be very cautious of size on these pants. I've given up."
4.0,Carhart pants are great!!
5.0,Absolutely fit perfect the cell phone pocket even holds my iPhone six which I didn't think it would it is larger than most so phones. Will probably order two more pair
3.0,A little tight but i guess if anything it just means now i have to exercise bc aside from being a bit tight in the waist there isn't any problems with the pants
1.0,Legs are to wide
5.0,"Great fit, got delivered fast!"
3.0,Fit ok at first. After the first wash in cold water and drying them low. They shrunk big time.
4.0,Carhartt products are the best for long lasting and durability. Love the side pockets.
5.0,great pant.  My husband loves these.
5.0,This is a replacement as my husband has almost worn out the others. He loves them.
3.0,"I love some aspects of these pants and hate others.
The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this. I believe there are fabric treatments that can greatly help this and are not too costly."
5.0,My husband loves these pants. Nice fit. Looks good on him.
5.0,Great all around!
5.0,Love these jeans.  Great fit.  Great Quality.
5.0,Great Pant.
5.0,"I was nervous about the sizes on these pants due to many reviews, but I still ordered my usual size and they fit perfect.  They are very comfortable and feel very durable. They fit over my work boots without any issues and the pockets are deep which I like. Ordered a second pair because I like them so much."
5.0,"I cut the hammer loops off because I don't like them, but otherwise these are great pants. The side pocket on the left outer thigh is big enough for just about any 5.0-5.5"" screened cell phone (even with case if the case isn't extra bulky.)"
5.0,"I was a little nervous buying these after reading some of the reviews. They fit him well and he loves them. Not sure where they were made. He is wearing them now, so can't exactly look at the tag."
5.0,"These paints fit better then I expected. They look good meaning they don't look like your typical carpenters jeans, people have said that I like your slacks. They are tough enough for everyday hard work. Furthermore, you can wear out dinner, church, ect..."
4.0,Very comfortable... I normally wear 32 waste but had to purchase 33 to fit properly though they do stretch a bit after wearing them. I did not notice any shrinkage from washing.
1.0,I don't understand why these fit much too small - my son has worn and continues to wear the exact same jeans in 34x32 - but these he can't even get on.
3.0,Fit small in the waist and inseam.
1.0,"Who makes these pants? They are NOT canvas, as I usually wear from Carhartt, and I can't see them lasting more than a month!
These are very light weight- made for summer months, perhaps. And they would still wear out fast. Lighter than denim.
I am very disappointed, as I need real work clothes right now for the winter months. First time I received anything sub-par from Amazon.
RRRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!"
5.0,"Good quality jeans , arrived on time and fit well , would Definayely buy again for my husband."
4.0,as expected
3.0,"These pants run small in the waist. I ordered the same size of the Levi jeans I wear, but these pants were much too small."
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants.  They are lightweight, comfortable, have the perfect amount of room in the seat and thigh, quick drying, and most importantly, they are incredibly tough.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and these are my new go-to for work pants."
5.0,Very nice!
5.0,nice jeans
5.0,"Holds up well! Nice and cool pants, I don't sweat as much in these as other work pants. Full range of motion. I have very large calves and these pants fit great. I have since ordered two more."
5.0,"Pants came as expected, but unfortunately we're too small. Need to exchange."
5.0,"Love the color, love the fit. Some of the best, rugged work jeans ever made!"
4.0,The pants are wonderful. My husband fit them so well.
3.0,material is lighter then expected
5.0,I can not find these in any local store and there great work pants
5.0,Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved them! A lot cheaper too through amazon!!
5.0,fit as expected  My husband really liked them
4.0,"look great, feel great, sized right."
5.0,delivered timely and intact
5.0,Fits him perfectly with given measurements.
5.0,"Great pants, tough and durable."
3.0,"Quality seems very good however these jeans are carpenter and loose fit and you really can't have both. They ran about a size too small when compared to true (just stated) carpenter jeans.
Shame because I was excited about this gift."
4.0,they good for work
5.0,Love these pants
5.0,"I was worried by some of the reviews that the size would not be correct, not so. Perfect"
5.0,They were marked 36 W 32 L but they were 36 inseam. Had to have a seamstress cut them off.
4.0,My husband is tall and sometimes difficult to fit.  His inseam is 34 inches which can be hard to find on the shelf with his waist size--I won't reveal that to prevent him getting upset with me.:)  The fabric is a sturdy weight yet flexible and moves with him.  He's very happy with the multiple pockets too.  We will definitely be purchasing more.
4.0,Pants are great.
5.0,perfect fit at great price
5.0,Great fit!
5.0,I bought these for my son and he loved them
5.0,Good durable fabric. Fits perfect.
5.0,My husband loves these pants.  Very comfortable fit.
3.0,"Loose fit I found out is bigger down the legs than I anticipated.  I feel like I'm wearing bell bottoms.  The ""relaxed fit"" is actually tapered a little bit and fit me great.  I bought two pairs of pants from Carhartt not paying attention to the style.  I'm not sure I'll like the ""loose fit"" (they will be washed & dried before I wear them) but I know I'll like my ""relaxed fit"" carpenter jeans."
5.0,These pants I ordered  fit very well just as they said  loose fit cell phone pocket very soft and comfortable would buy again priced wright.
5.0,"It is quite difficult to find pants that fit what I would call a normal man, they all seem to be incredibly tight around the thighs and crotch area it's as if man hating women design pants for men these days leaving us real men with no room for our man parts with all of these ""skinny jeans"" NO real men wear skinny jeans. We need a little room.
Well guys, look no further, I have found the quintessential work pants for the real men that are left with their parts intact.
Very comfortable in all the important areas, and great for carpenters (of which I am one) hammer holsters, a few pockets for a utility knife or other hand tools and they appear to be tough, time will tell.
Do yourself a favor and try a pair."
4.0,"These look reallly nice, and wash and wear well.  Very popular with the young men!"
5.0,Good fit and great pants
5.0,"great fit, fast shipping"
4.0,They fit and are comfortable
5.0,I have had this brand before but they discontinued the style I liked. These were the closest I could find to my old favorites. These are just perfect for me and my day to day life.
5.0,"I work in the construction field, and I'm constantly having trouble with jeans tearing, especially now when even good old reliable Levis are thin as paper. I used to wear Silver Tab Levi's, but the cut of the jean is now so messed up I can't fit into them and feel comfortable. So I ordered two pairs of these Carhartts, and I couldn't be happier. Just remember, like others have said, get the waist one size bigger, and the length one size shorter, and they should fit you as expected."
5.0,Great
5.0,Pants are excellent and fit great
5.0,"These pants are awesome, very durable. Bought some other colors after wearing them for a day."
5.0,"Timely delivery, fit better than expected, lighter than dickies but somehow seems tougher"
5.0,Christmas gift.  Just what I wanted.  Hard to get in the store.
5.0,Best work/outdoor pants I have ever wore. Rugged but stylish with plenty of room and pockets
5.0,Green jean that fit
5.0,I've been wearing these pants for years now...you cant go wrong!
4.0,"kinda long , measured them at 33in not 32in length."
5.0,I ordered these for my husband & they are great quality & pricing was as good if not better than the stores.
4.0,Sharp looking jeans and color. Great fit from a quality company and name !!
5.0,Very comfortable and sturdy
5.0,The fit and feel is fantastic!
3.0,"They fit, they clean up well and they have a cell phone pocket! just one problem it is easy to confuse the hammer loop on the right side with the cell phone pocket and the results can be disastrous! A simple change in the loop or pocket position would make a big difference!!"
5.0,bought a couple pairs last year had same problem they run small other than that my son & son in law luv them
5.0,Very nice
2.0,"I've bought a few pairs of canvas pants from other brands and have been really happy with them.  So I figured that spending the extra money on a pair of Carhart's might be worth the extra money, I was very disappointed in the quality of the fabric, very thin and cheap feeling IMO.
Most of the other pairs of canvas pants I've bought have been around $25, these were $40...I'd much rather buy two pairs of other brands for only $10 more than the Carhart's.  I feel like I'm spending $15 on the Carhart name and not for added quality or craftsmanship.
I'm going to return these."
5.0,these are a great pair of Jeans
5.0,good work pants for a tinknocker!!  well fitting  and constructed
3.0,"Like the waist fit ,but the length was about an inch to long. Loose fit is loose for sure, Will wash in wear for the season. Then post update on comfort and durability."
4.0,As expected
5.0,"there is not much to say abt this product bt they are as I expected,love the way they fit I will be ordering more."
4.0,"I hate trying to find pants that fit, a size 40 is always too big and a 38 always seems to be too tight even relaxed fit but, these size 38 loose fit we're just right. I was nervous buying them online without trying them on but, if you have the same problem as I do when trying to find pants that aren't as tight as a 38 original or relaxed and not as loose as a size 40 try these out."
1.0,"OH my goodness, my first Carhartt that my husband hated. It runs WAY small, he is definitely a 38 waist and has trim legs and is tall. He couldn't get these past his calf! Loose-Fit, in what universe? Had to return, thank goodness the refund was quick."
2.0,"I've worn Carhartt's my whole life, excellent pant. This version is *not* their ultra tough version so don't expect great durability. These are more for going around town, not working.

The one problem I found is they're HUGE! Both in length and width, these are far too big compared to other Carhartt pants I've bought in the same exact size. Make sure to drop one size if you buy these."
5.0,"Great product, great deal!!!!"
5.0,"The limiting factor on pants is crotch room.  If it ain't there, it ain't gonna work.  These are not absurdly baggy, but they do give just a bit of extra room there so I'm not squeezed.  Very comfy.  The material is a little stiff at first but softens nicely.  Like any cotton pants, the pants length shrinks a good inch or more, but the waist (and crotch length) remains unchanged.  I bought a second pair."
5.0,"Tough, comfortable and great all around jeans. At this price, you should have a closet full."
5.0,Fantastic work wear. Great fit. Delivered on time.
5.0,"For the last 10 years I have bought all my work clothes from Duluth Trading, sadly each year the prices went up until finally they priced themselves out of my life. I bought these pants from Amazon at a great price, and I will tell you I love them. I have been wearing them 10 hours a day for two weeks, they are the right size and very comfortable for me."
5.0,"This is my second pair. After reading reviews at first I ordered one inch larger in the waist. Fit well but a little large in waist. This time I ordered my size. The same size I wear in Boss, Levis, and everything else. Fits perfect!

To those that say these pants are small, I'd took a look at the bathroom scale. Then head to the gym."
1.0,"For the price, I expected better quality.  After a few washings, the color runs off the thigh areas and mostly at the knees just like a cheap jeans.  This undesirable effect is much more pronounced in the darker colors (e.g. Navy blue or black).  The pants looks old after just a few washings because of the inconsistent color loss.

After a few more washings, the material starts to fray, tear and deteriorate along the edges of the pockets and at the bottom of the legs.

If you are looking for a heavy-duty durable pair of pants for work, this brand is not for you."
2.0,"I purchased these to be work pants worn as a DIY'er home renovator.  The fabric is just swiss cheese after about a dozen wearings.  I have never had fabric just open up all over the place like this.  It is not the seems, the fabric itself doesn't hold up."
5.0,These pants fit well. A good price for Carhart pants.
5.0,"Love these pants perfect amount of pockets for all my things (tools, Cell phone, etc.). Love the color and the durable feel. They are lighter weight then some of my other pairs but I prefer this. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants the great quality products that Carhartt makes."
5.0,Great quality.
5.0,superb fit in waist and legs. length was just right!
4.0,"Pants were as descibed in product description, size was good, fit loose in leg all round good work pants."
5.0,Recommend for men.
4.0,Fit is closer to what size I would wear for khakis. I thought they would be closer to jeans.
5.0,Very comfortable
5.0,As always a great product been wearing them for about 10 years
5.0,Always quality pants with a good fit.
5.0,great pants
4.0,LOVE THEM. NEED ANOTHER COLOR
5.0,"Soft and comfortable but still a bit too big, going to swap out for a smaller size. If your buying these get your size or smaller"
5.0,"It is hard - so hard - to find pants that hold up well and also look good. You find straight leg this, ugly blue that, skinny jeans, baggy jeans, dad jeans. It's frustrating.

These pants from Carhartt are not only functional and durable, they're damn good looking. The colors they come in are neutral, but attention grabbing. I've already had a few people ask me where I got my pants from. They go good with pretty much any shoe/shirt combo.

I've got kind of a thing for Carhartt ever since buying the best cold-weather hoodie I've ever owned from them last year, and the fact that these pants are as good as they are has solidified my business with them I think."
5.0,Like the way they fit and feel and the color.  The side pocket is good for a cell phone.
3.0,These pant started slightly small and shrank further on washing  Length is short.
5.0,"Fits perfect, nice sturdy material!!"
5.0,These pants are very well made. The fit is as expected. I am pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Just what I wanted
5.0,Pants fit as expected and they are extremely comfortable.  I removed the hammer loops and I love having a small pocket on each side of the pants.  This is one of three pairs of Carhartt pants I have purchased and they are all wonderful.  I wanted to get away form cargo pants and these definitely hit the mark.
3.0,Kind of tight
5.0,"Very nice,  amazing price!"
5.0,Love these pants! I don't wear anything else. If they had more colors I would buy more
5.0,"I've been looking for a good pair of khaki pants for work. I have finally found them! I teach middle school technology and need a durable pant that can withstand tools, but still look professional. The loose-fit provides plenty of room, but not baggy. I love the small side pocket for my phone without making these pants look like cargo pants. The sizing was spot on for me. At 40 dollars, it's a bit more than I'd like to spend, but I find these are worth it. I like these pants so much, I bought 3 more pair."
5.0,Good deal. Couldn't find this color locally for the loose fit.
5.0,"I love the way these pants fit for me. I have larger than average thighs and butt (thank you powerlifting), so it can sometimes be a challenge to find trousers that fit comfortably. I appreciate that these have the room that I need without my having to buy a bigger waist size and cinch it in with a belt.

The fabric seems more durable than other brands of demin I have tried, but magically, it is softer than expected. I will certainly buy these again before I buy another pair of Wrangler or Levi."
5.0,Great pair of durable pants
4.0,Fits perfectly and great quality
5.0,"These fit better than expected and are very comfortable to work in. The pockets are good. I'm 6'7"" tall and these had plenty of length."
4.0,Slightly tight at the waist but I may have ordered one size too small.
5.0,Very good pant
5.0,"These are my favorite ""office casual"" pants. They look good and are incredibly comfortable.

They may be a little thinner than jeans, but the fabric seems pretty durable. I now have three colors and can't find anything to complain about.

Wife says they make my butt look good, too. Score!"
5.0,Good
5.0,Of course these are great workpants.  They're Carhartt.
3.0,Legs and thighs are comfortable but the butt area of the pants is a little tight for a loose fit
5.0,Nice color and fits as expected
5.0,"These quickly became my most comfortable pair of pants. Arrived more quickly than expected, too."
5.0,Great pair of pants - - I've been wearing them for years now and they are still well made and comfortable
5.0,"Gosh, they look good!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,"Good sturdy canvas fabric. Lightweight for summer. I am a carpenter, and these are loose enough to all me to easily bend, squat & move. Good array of pockets, and my iPhone easily fits in the side-leg pocket. I'll be getting more of these."
5.0,"hubby loves Carhartt, wears them everyday."
4.0,like all carhartt pants and shorts i have had these pants have to be ordered at least one size larger.  this has not been the case with their shirts but always with pants.
4.0,Will buy againg !!!
5.0,"Love these pants.  Can be hot in the summer, but super durable."
2.0,I have purchased Carhartt pants before and they fit comfortably.  This pair was too long and I had to pay a local seamstress to take them up an inch.
4.0,"Not as loose fit as others in the same size and category, but wearable.  They seem well made and durable.  If they last, I will buy again."
4.0,"Size fits spot on but in a loose and comfortable way.  Legs are a bit big at the end, like bell-bottoms, but not bad.  Quality is good, yet another solid buy from Carhartt."
5.0,"My husband loves these pants but they are kind of hard to find. We found all the colors here and the size fits exactly as the ones he bought in  the local store. We purchased the navy blue, and were kind of worried it would be too bright, but it is a true navy blue and looks great. The pants are durable and wear well. They do become softer with repeated washings but do not look worn out. Now that I can find them, I will be buying more for my husband."
4.0,Great shorts and fit well but shrink with every washing and drying.  Order one waist size larger.
3.0,"The pants are sold as ""loose -fit""  which they are not.  I just returned a 36 waist for a 38 waist size (that makes me feel good:) . As for the rest they look and feel good- and that would get the product more stars.  I would highly suggest getting the next size."
5.0,Will order more pairs
5.0,great quality and feel. I bought the pants a size larger for comfort and with the loose fit they are quite baggy but they are of great quality so its a menial problem
5.0,excelente
5.0,I have looked or a good place to buy Carhartt jeans in all colors and sizes at a good price with no luck. UNTIL NOW !!! all th colors you want and sizes you need awsome
5.0,Favorite work pants of all time.
5.0,"Good product, good price!"
5.0,Great pants. Room to move and work pockets are awesome. Comfortable for larger built men
5.0,Very comfortable.
4.0,"The first pair were dead on, fit in the waist. The second pair..not so much. But that seems to be true in all clothing. And other brands wear just as long"
5.0,"Great looking pair of pants! Fit as expected. And even though they are described as loose fit, they are slimmer than the regular fit B151. Great pants for work and casual wear."
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants. They fit so well and they are really comfortable, light weight and plenty of leg room. They do run 1/2 size smaller in the waist but fit me perfectly, I don't need a belt. Will be buying plenty more of these pants real soon."
4.0,I bought these for my husband. They fit great on him which was great after reading some reviews regarding sizes not being accurate. My husband requested that I buy another pair for him.
5.0,good
5.0,"Length was great. Waste was just a little small but not uncomfortable. I have never ordered my clothing online before  but anymore in order to find my size thats what I have to do. 36"" inseams are not readily available in stores. The pants feel great. Will definitely order again. This time I ordered 5 pairs."
4.0,"im a big guy that needed some khaki pants and carharts last so that's what I went with, they work like a charm"
4.0,Really comfy nice loose fit I usually wear the B11 but their a little heavy for summer these are about right for the hot summer months. 4 stars because I like them on the waist and these are little below. Will buy again.
5.0,"My husband loves these pants. He said they were the most comfortable pants he has ever worn, as a matter of fact- I am going to order another pair of them for him.  They look good for work casual wear."
1.0,I ordered 31x32 and the length was more like 34. Really baggy as well. I will definitley return these and order the relaxed fit.
4.0,"I have a waist size of 39, so the fit is just a little large.......but I love the style and fit because it's comfort personified. Just make for the in between sizes and instead of four and a half it would have been a clear five."
2.0,"MENS CARHARTS/WHY. always liked them,but it seems that they make the pant legs just too too wide look at other makers and you will see the different in them size wise,although i love buying from amazon they can use some tips and advise about clothes i take my clothes really serious,and always make sure i look nice even if im not going anywhere thank you"
5.0,Great looking and fit. I'm a young guy and still care how I look but wanted a pant that would hold up to repeated punishment. I would rate these as rugged as jeans and a good alternative.
5.0,"Material is lightweight for summer, but tough. I purchased one pair to check the fit and cloth. Found the pants to be of high quality and comfortable. After two weeks of use I bought two additional pair of the same size and found the fit to be consistent for all three pairs."
5.0,All i wear are carhartt pants. I wish they made this canvas carpenter design in more than 3 colors because I have 2 pairs of each. These are the most comfortable pants that I have ever owned. They are breathable and not rough like the typical work pants. This is my favorite color as well.
2.0,The pants arrived with a giant stain on the knee area.  They are work pants so im not gonna go into the trouble of returning but was still pretty upset
5.0,"I bought a khaki pair from a retailer but they didn't have the grey in my size.  These came on time and fit as expected. Good price as well. Bonus, the wife loves them on my as well ;)"
4.0,"The legs are a bit long for my size but overall I like it. The color is just fine, thanks"
5.0,"These pants are excellent quality and exceptionally well-made.  They are perfect for any occasion, and they are a comfortable fit."
5.0,"I'm a large 36...and they fit me perfect. I really like them. I haven't worn them to work yet so I cannot give a total review but...plenty of room to move around.
I still like them although...the fabric on these last 2 pair leaves a lot to be desired...by 11-1-16 I have holes in both knees on both pair.
I will not buy again (I have ordered 4 pair in the past and it took quite a bit longer to develop holes)
I will try the double knees 1 time and see it it is better...if not...no more"
5.0,"Lightweight, durable, looks great, has plenty of pockets, and is not too hot when it heats up but provides enough warmth in the winters in southeast Texas.  Will be buying many times over when my other pants are wearing out."
5.0,"My husband liked these carpenter pants even better than previous ones that he had in denim - excellent weight, fit and quality of material - and excellent service by Elite Hero!"
5.0,"Excellent pants.  Roomy, comfortable.  Seems to be a lighter version of regular types of blue jeans, consequently, not as hot as regular jeans.  I normally take a size 33 waist pants, but this pants was way too tight and for the first time in my life,  I had to order a size 35 waist, which fit me perfectly.  Liked the pants so much,  I ordered another pair.  Perfect for hot hard work conditions.  Moss green hides dirt stains really great also."
5.0,"Lots of subtle pockets on both hips are what makes these pants nice.  Many of us need those extra pockets for things like, keys, wallet, phone, large pocket knife, mini pocket knife, pistol, etc.  These pants accommodate your EDC every day carry items.  The key word is ""subtle,"" and Carhartt did a great job integrating these pockets in a way that doesn't draw too much attention."
5.0,"If your looking for a pair of pants that will show off the brand of briefs you are wearing these are not for you. If though you are looking for a proper fitting work pants, here you go. I am a MOW railroader and  need pants that wear well and fit well. theses are the ones. Have been wearing the B159 for years. They say loose fit but seem just right."
5.0,With Carhartt you get a quality product. I find that I always get what I pay for and they last a long time. Great for work.
3.0,"It seems that Carhartt has compromised with quality in an effort to stay competitively priced, like most manufactures are doing now.
It's happening with most products. Packages have become smaller, quantities are less, etc. to keep the price the same. I purchased these very pants 2 years ago and the fabric is MUCH thinner, although it says canvas. I have struggled to find a durable work pant in my size, and thought Carhartt was my best option until now. Unfortunately, Carhartt has discontinued my size, therfore I thought I would buy all 3 pair. I also ordered from another supplier who indicated that they could not fulfill the order due to the size being discontinued. I do not plan to return these because they fit. My experience with the seller is not the issue, but thought they should be aware.
Thanks again"
5.0,They run small order up one size bigger light weight limited colors and baggy in the hips other than that cathartic
5.0,"These pants are comfortable, easy to maintain. I like them because they have pockets for my glasses case and a cell phone. They are utilitarian while at the same time are dressy enough for day to day office wear."
5.0,The fit is loose but not too baggy.  Very nice color as well. I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't like the heavy fit of jeans.
5.0,"My husband loved these pants.  He said that they fit him much more comfortable and looser than relaxed fit ones did, that he ended up returning back to amazon.  Colors are good, wear is good...you can work or dress them up if you need to.  A good buy all the way around for my Honey!!  We ordered 4 pairs of the carhartt men's lose fit canvas carpenter pant"
5.0,"Most carhartt pants are too high waisted for my husband, but these fit the bill.  They are a very competitive price on amazon and fit right for the man that doesn't want his pants under his chest.  He likes his pants just under his belly.  He's 50.  We ordered the 32 length which is his usual size and thought they were too long when we got them but after washed, they are a great length and none too short.  Just right.  He's glad carhartt is finally seeing a market for the below waist fit."
2.0,Pants fit too big for 32x32. I need more words... NIne Eight Seven Six Five Four Three Two One Done
5.0,"For years I've been stuck in limbo where most pants only come in even sizes. This has aggravated me for years because 30x32 is too tight and 32x32 is too loose; but then I happened to see some Carhartt's in an outdoors store. I was surprised to see they make 31x32 so I bought a pair. I was worried they would become too tight after washing, but when washed and dried these fall right within the exact size they specify. These pants are durable, nice looking, nice fitting and last awhile. This is the 3rd pair to my collection because these pants are clearly made to last. You get what you pay for with these. They're not cheap - but neither is the quality. 100% cotton canvas made in the U.S. - I will forever be a Carhartt's kid!"
5.0,There tailored to fit. I have searched for a while looking for the perfect fit. Thank you for making my pants life better
3.0,"Every time I buy a pair of Carhartt carpenter pants they turn out to be a slightly different material and a slightly different color and different pocket configurations.  I wish I could get a pair like the first ones I had, they even had a little tab to hang a tape measure on.  These are okay, just not quite the same."
2.0,How can I return the jeans for a smaller size I need a 30x 30 for my husband email me n let me know thanks
4.0,"Buying these pants, I thought they were a more work and tough pant, but after I opened them, It seemed like they were more of a causal pant rather than work. With that said, I will still use them for around the yard or work garage. The Material is thin, more like dress pants."
2.0,"This was my third pair of the the same style and size. This pair came in approximately 4"" longer in the leg. Will have to take them to a tailor to fix as I have to roll them 3 times so they don't drag on the floor. Waist sizing was spot on."
5.0,these pants fit me like a glove. They are the first pants I have ever had that fit so well. I have large thighs and a short waist and the fit is fantastic. I have always loved the extra pockets for my phone and such too.
5.0,"I have about ten pairs of these pants in different colors and wear them everyday.  As a field service technician I constantly find myself on the floor, under desks, behind equipment, etc.  and my work clothes really take a beating.  These pants have held up really well and show little signs of wear after a year of service (even the color has not faded).

The only improvement to these pants would be to remove the ""hammer loops"", as they get in the way of the cell phone and utility pockets (or you can just cut them off like I did).  I had never purchased a Carhartt product before these and now that's all I wear!"
5.0,"I'm peeved that these are $10 less than I paid.
These are not made in the US now, mine were made in Mexico.

They seem to be good quality, great loose fit in the crotch, legs and back end. I like the 2 side pockets and loops, my smart phone fits in one and a can of snuf in the other.
The seams and stitching looks uniform, my only complaint is one side pocket was to tight for my phone.
I ordered the navy blue for 2 pairs, mistake there it showed up everything. I
thought I'd put them in a light bleach wash to dull em out. They came out a duck jean color, I like it better."
1.0,"mens size is not accurate.  Waist was small, the fit was not at all right.  I would not recommend these pants."
5.0,These pants will last! The material is thinner than some others so these are great for summer. I will buy more!
5.0,"My husband has a closet full of these pants. They wear well, wash well, and are very sturdy. They are also just a little nicer than regular jeans."
5.0,My husband loves these carhartts for work and casual wear. He is hard on clothes but these are durable and lasting him well.
5.0,"Waist size is 36 where in jeans I'm 34, FYI.  These pants are perfect for working or casual wear, very comfortable and so far seem very durable!"
5.0,These were a gift to my nephew.  He says they are his favorite pants now.  I will probably buy him another pair for his Birthday!
5.0,I love these pants! I run a pest control company and constantly have to work in crawl spaces and around houses. I have beat the crap out of them many times  and they look better all the time. I now own 3 pairs but my favorite are my oldest( broke in ) pair. They look thin compared to other carhartt's but don't let the thinner feel fool you. They will hold up to whatever damage you put them through and will still look great. I get many compliments on them and plenty of attention from women. I don't see myself going back to jeans  or other pants anytime soon.
5.0,"Best pants on the market because of their durability  They wear as they say ""like iron"" compared to just regular jeans like lee jeans which rip at the back pockets"
5.0,"Easy to order & quick delivery!

These are the perfect work pants! Heavy duty and great fit! Multiple colors and sizes to fit all."
2.0,"Not really happy with the fit of these pants, sent them back as they were too small.  I love the cargo pants that Amazon sells on here which has a great fit."
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants!  I wear these, in multiple colors, daily at work and they are perfect for my needs.  They are comfortable, don't shrink in the wash, color doesn't fade and there are enough pockets to keep all your things separate!  Great product!"
5.0,"I bought these pants for my husband who is in construction and they have now become his favorite work pants. He is a Project Manager and when he has to meet with Homeowners these are his dressy construction pants because of the khaki color, cut and fabric weight; but he can still work in them. I think that the pants run a little long/inseam; he normally wears a 34 inseam but I should have ordered him a 32 inseam."
5.0,They fit  great . They are the  light weight ones. Next time I need to check the onces and get a heavier one
4.0,"Very good quality, if you order these pants you must order the next size up. I am a true 33 waist and these pants are 34 and just fit."
2.0,"size is inaccurate. this was at least one size too big in every direction. quality seems lower than the many other carhartt pants I have - thin, odd fitting"
5.0,I have worn the B159 and FRB159 for several years for work.  Very comfortable.  I often wear them to other places other than work.
5.0,"Carhartt Men's Loose-Fit Canvas Carpenter Pant B159, Charcoal, 38x32, Just like the Carhartt shorts I love with two pockets for my cell phones"
4.0,Bougth to wear for work have had no problems but wish the material was thicker. good deal for the price.
5.0,"My measurements in Wrangler, Wrangler RIGGS, and 'most' other brand pants is 40-42"" Waist, 34"" Inseam (this is for Loose fit clothing).
For Carhartt (Loose Fit pants) I ordered one size larger [than Wrangler] based on customer reviews / recommendations (from Amazon, Sierra Trading Post, and Working Person Store) and this hindsight worked perfectly; 42X34 fits great. The pants are SOOOO comfortable and give a very-very good amount of crotch room (you won't be adjusting your underwear / removing weggies every time you sit down / stand-up).

*If you like Wrangler Loose fit products and HATE having inadequate crotch-room I highly recommend these pants, just order one size larger (in the waist) than your normal size. Hope this helps!"
5.0,"Great fit, heavier than regular slacks - just right for my job  -- I move around a lot and bend and stretch - perfect!"
5.0,"They fit great, had other carhartt's before and I am sure these will hold up just as good. Definitely going to buy more like these in the near future."
5.0,"I've been wearing Carhartt work pants for at least a decade or more. In the past I've experienced extremely high durability in their Dungaree pants with the double layer front legs which are perfect on cold winter work days but, just waaaaaay too HOT in the spring/summer. The single layer Dungaree has worked out fine for those warmer days but, I've just never really been totally satisfied with the cut & feel of these pants even though I wore them years on end not having any better alternative UNTIL... discovering the B159 'Loose Fit' pants. Now wearing them for 2 years+,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carhartt-Men-s-Loose-Fit-Canvas-Carpenter-Pant-B159/dp/B002G9U8LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carhartt Men's Loose-Fit Canvas Carpenter Pant B159</a>&nbsp;they are my standard. They fit much more comfortably, feel softer, and are always reached for first in my pants pile even if it means searching through the entire stack if it turns out that they are all already in the dirty clothes bin! They do wear out into thin spots or holy knees about a year sooner than the Dungarees but, feel MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE all along the way!!!! On line to buy four more today."
5.0,Use for Sat installation and hold up really well to snags or sharp objects. If I had been wearing my Levis I would have had to replace many of times. They do not hold up to well to stains like grease or oils too much A real hard cleaning is needed for that and they do tend to fade some. Other than that I will continue to purchase
3.0,"I have about 8 pair of carhartt pants in three different styles that I wear the same size in. They all fit great. These pants are just exactly how they are described. Low waist, which translates to low sagging crotch which makes inseam hang two or three inches longer at my feet. Material was great. Right hand leg pocket was smaller than my other pants which is where I keep my phone, very tight fit for iPhone in a case. Sent them back. Read description closely if ordering"
5.0,They move well and last a long time.  Will certainly buy more in the future.  Good for an everyday pant or work pant.
5.0,"I was surprised how comfortable these are. The color is the same as the photo, which I am seeing is rare on Amazon clothing. It isn't really a charcoal color as you can see by the photo, but that is fine with me. The ""cell phone pockets"" are kind of useless with any newer phone, but I like the look anyway. They mean flip phones and whatnot, it won't fit an iphone or samsung galaxy. I ordered my normal length with 1 size up waist, and it fits perfectly. My normal waist size would have been too tight. Glad I bought these."
1.0,"POOR QUALITY, NOT RUGGED ENOUGH FOR TODAYS WORK PROJECTS AND CANNOT STAND UP TO THE CARHART NAME BRAND I KNOW SO WELL"
2.0,"waist was a bit low, kind of gave you a wedgie if you pulled them up even a little bit and also with larger sizes."
5.0,"Rugged, stylish, great fit and quick ship. They fit well, might run just a shade long, but not enough that you should order a size down."
4.0,"I like the way they fit, but the material is a little light for work pants.  I hope they hold up."
5.0,My husband has worn these for several years for work.  They look nice and are durable for quite some time.  He works outside and they take a beating.  He does wear them out eventually but that is because he has a job that causes a lot of wear and tear.
4.0,Awesome to get the actual size 35 waist fits like it should on me...these are a light weight canvas and look good etc.
5.0,I couldn't be happier with these pants. They were exactly what I was looking for. Not too dressy and durable. The size was accurate too.
5.0,"These pants fit me perfectly.
I would recommend these to all my friends and family.
The price is a great deal also."
1.0,"I ordered a charcoal color of these pants a while back.  They fit OK.  I usually order the thicker material pants from Carhartt and they always fit perfectly around the butt area.  I ordered a pair of ""Golden Khaki"" colors of these last week, assuming that they would be similar to the charcoal ones.  Looks like they are literally, no exaggeration, cut for women with extra large behinds.  Several washes in hot water and hot drier cycle do not seem to have made a difference.  Unfortunately I already cut those two funky side loops off as I usually do to Carhartt pants, so cannot return them.  They are sitting on my donation to charity pile right now."
4.0,"The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that I did manage to wear these out. Although it took much longer to do that than other pants I've had in the past, I did manage to wear them out. I own 4 pairs of these pants and it took me about 4 months to wear out one pairs.
On Carhartt's website they go for $48 plus about $12 for processing and shipping. So the total ends up at $60. When I saw them on Amazon Prime for $39 I was pretty stoked. It's a great deal.
They are super comfortable and contrary to the general consensus of Carhartt being stiff and rough pants, these are actually very soft and flexible. I will definitely be buying more."
5.0,"Pros:
-Fit
-Comfort
-Color
-Extra-pockets
-Carhartt brand

Cons:
Not made in the US. Otherwise no other problems with the product."
3.0,"I ordered these pants in the Dark Brown color today (June 26, 2013). I was very excited as I love this brand of pant. As I placed my order the pants showed as being ""in stock"" (and still do by the way). A couple hours later I received an email from Midwest Workwear informing me that my color choice was not in stock and wouldn't be until the Fall. They did offer me some other color choices, but none in which I had interest.

I canceled my order and now have to wait for a refund of my funds (some in the form of a gift card for my birthday). I wish that Midwest Workwear would have policed their offering on Amazon providing accurate information on what is actually available. Perhaps when they see this feedback they will."
5.0,"I am a forester and work outside in very hot weather. These are the best pants I've ever worn - I own 4 pairs. Carhartts aren't cheap, these are worth it. They are heavy duty, and breath pretty well. They dry pretty fast - if you've ever worked a Louisiana forest in July you know what I'm talking about.

These are a little baggy so a 30 inch waist hangs a little loose -- plenty of legroom for moving around. I wear them when climbing, but the legs are a little loose for that."
5.0,This is my second pair of Carhartt pants and I really like them. You can't go wrong with cotton. These are well made pants and fit comfortably. This is a brand and style that I would buy again.
5.0,"Durable, comfortable, nice extra pockets.  Great value.  Can't think of any negatives.  I do disagree with what another reviewer said about these pants running small.  My 34x32 pair is perfect."
5.0,"Nice pants, great fit at my 6'3"" height. My only real concern is even though I got the same model number on several pairs of these some seem to be made of a lighter weight canvas/duck than others. These were a light weight soft but durable pair but the moss pair can almost stand up in the corner on their own. The side leg pockets fit my comically large phone easily. I will keep buying these as long as they keep making them."
5.0,"The Title says it all, I was wandering how the fit would be by not being able to try them on and it was perfect."
5.0,"These are a great choice for people who need durable work pants, but want something that is lightweight and breathes.  The mushroom color is also really nice.  I have purchased several pairs of these exact pant, as I work on airplanes and they get put through the wringer with wear and grease.  They hold up and still look good, I love them."
3.0,"The pants are okay the problem I have is with the consistency of the size.  You can order three pairs and none will be exactly the same size.  The length on one was too short and another pair too long.  Buying these jeans is a lot like bignGoldilocks some are too big, some are too small and some are just right.  It is a hit or miss for these pants."
2.0,"Tight in the waist and big in the legs.  Size up on the waist, I'm usually a 33 and had to go with a 35 to fit right."
4.0,"The fit is good, which is always an issue when ordering online.  Feel is good as well.  I would recommend."
4.0,"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans. Items that ride comfortably in the watch pocket of my other carpenter jeans either don't fit, or ride up and dig into my side, if I stick them in the change pocket of these pants."
3.0,"NO TO BAD BUT I PREFER  THE B-11 FOR ME THOSE THE BEST ,  BUT  I  RECOMMEND TO ANYONE  YOU  STILL LOOK GOOD."
5.0,I bought these pants for my boyfriend....he loves them.  I would buy this item again. It is very difficult to find pants thar fit him' but Amazon made it easy!
5.0,We previously purchased this product.  My husband likes the comfort fit and the lower side pocket to carry his cell phone. He has used this purchase for the last 3 years.
5.0,"This is a very high quality product, and by far my favorite pair of jeans.
I also own a pair of flannel-lined Carhartts, which are great for Winter."
5.0,i love the quality of the clothes they wear well and last longer and carhartt is a name everyone can trust
4.0,"Like other reviewers, runs small (normally a 35 or 36 but the 38 fit well), but much lighter weight than a few pair I purchased a few years ago. Hopefully they hold up well..."
3.0,This turned out to be a lot lighter in weight than the other Carhartts I have. Now they just sit in a drawer.
2.0,The sizes advertized were not where delivered.  I'm guessing these were misfits or problem products in the beginning.  Guess I'll just have to use the store for hubbies needs.
5.0,"Lightweight yet durable. I prefer these over the other types of pants carhartt makes especially those made of canvas. They hold their own and I love the extra pockets for writing utensils, knives or whatever you need!"
5.0,This is one of many pairs of Carhartt pans I own and the wear like steel.  The fit is good (for me at least) and they are also comfortable.  I've had some pairs for 2 years and I wear each of them at least once or twice a week.  i wouldn't hesitate to order more the next time I need pants.
5.0,"My husband needed another pair of work pants for weekend projects. He's always liked Carhartts and I thought I was ordering the model he already had. These carpenter pants are a little lighter than the heavy canvas that he currently wears (my mistake) but are even better for our hot climate. He'll be able to wear them through the summer. Now I need to order another pair or two so they can occasionally be laundered. And as always, Amazon service is first rate."
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  They have held up great & wash and dry well with no shrinking!
5.0,"My husband is 6'6"" so finding pants that work can be hard. With the 38x36 loose fit, he really likes them. If it wasn't the loose fit, it wouldn't fit right for his height."
5.0,My husband wears a pair of these pants on the work site every day and swears by them. They have a sturdy quality and nice look/fit.
5.0,"In true Carhart fashion you never know what you are going to get until they actually arrive and you try them on. They were 2"" longer than the tagged size."
5.0,"Recommendation shop for excellent sales, delivery and articles.
Thank you very much for the good quality of service, keep it up!"
4.0,"Comfy, tough and cheap. Not exactly designer jeans, but they're great bouldering pants!! Carhartt's sizing system is one of the mysteries of the universe, but these fit pretty true-to size. Maybe a little on the small side (ie, maybe order one inch larger waist size than you usually do...)."
3.0,"I bought  pants 40"" on amazon pants without any problem, I ventured to buy these pants the same size but turned out to be much smaller...."
5.0,"I have tried a number of these pants over the past few weeks.  I have been looking for a durable pair of pants to use for work around the house.  But I wanted a pair of pants I could keep on when stepping out for lunch or picking up the kids.  These pants fit well, have great pockets .... just perfect.  I even played a quick game of hockey with my son & fell in the street.  The pants held up great with no rips or tears.  I'm going back to buy more soon."
5.0,"I swear by Carhartt pants and these do not disappoint.  Perfect combination of durable, comfortable, and functional.  Highly recommend the product and you simply cannot beat the price Amazon offers."
5.0,"These are good quality pants, have little pockets on each leg (for cellphones, etc.), and come in the size and color as ordered."
5.0,I work outside all day and I need pants that don't slip down- obviously. The high waist of these trousers make these the most comfortable fit for me ever. I now have the heavier cotton variety too.
4.0,After looking for a time I have found a replacement for my carpenter pants that are wearing out. I have purchased both the relaxed and loose fit jeans to help me decide what works as a year round work jean. The loose is much better for the cold weather (due to layers) and leave lots of room to still feel comfortable throughout my day. The relaxed is a slightly tighter fit. I prefer the loose.
4.0,"I really like these because of the color selection and the position of the front pockets (more like blue jeans vice the slash style pocket opening). They are a lightweight canvas (nice) and very comfortable. Carhartt always produces a good product. They run true to size for me (I have numerous types of Carhartt pants). Intend to replace all my ""khaki"" twill pants with these."
5.0,My son requested these pants and loves them!  He will wear the pants until they can't be worn anymore!  You guys are the best!
3.0,Have purchased many pairs of pants in the past. The material in this pair is much thinner than any I have bought in the past. I don't expect them to last as long.
5.0,"bought these to replace my ripped ones, not the same model, I ordered the wrong ones, but these worked out well, light weight but still warm."
4.0,"It's hard to find work pants in my size and color.  My job requires navy blue, and they were my size.  An added bonus is that they are cotton so they stay cool.  Very good deal for me.  I will buy more."
5.0,"just as advertised, comfortable, durable, fit perfect. great for carpentry and working on all home projects and i also use them when i paint."
4.0,"These r very comfty for my bf. He absolutely loves them! Unfortunately, we already have a couple holes in them due to pliers- not as sturdy as the harder material ones but more comfty. Quick delivery :)"
5.0,"36"" waist was right on.  Maybe 1/2"" smaller than some others at the start of the day.

Waist sits a little higher than I wanted, jams into stomach when you sit down a little, but since they're they only decent colored pants out there, I'm buying some more.  Fit looks good, even at the end of the day, compared to most jeans.  Very comfy, fits good but can still move around."
5.0,"Because of other's reviews of this product I had some difficulty choosing the right size. Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent. Keep in mind that if using these for work darker colors will be less prone to stains and dirt, however, even Carhartts in lighter colors clean up well."
5.0,"I really do like these jeans (Pants really)
They fit perfect and the leg pocket is the perfect size for my Blackberry.
For the money you cant go wrong."
5.0,I'll start by saying that the sizing is def. different than other brands. I was hesitant to purchase these online after reading the reviews about the sizing problems. I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week. The only problem I have noticed is that they seem to come out of the drier very wrinkled but it is not a big deal. Overall I would reccomend these pants.
5.0,"Carhartt jeans are high quality, and the loose-fit Carpenter model is a very good all-round choice. They are durable enough to wear while performing manual labour, and elegant enough to use at a formal occation."
1.0,"These are thin and not what I expected,more like slacks. I prefer the heavy duck type. My bad for this one. I'm sure they are of good quality if these are what your looking for."
5.0,"Good work pants.  Pretty durable and comfortable. This is my third pair.  I wish Carhart would make a version of these pants with more durable knee patches, like out of ballistic nylon, thin removable knee foam pads would be great too."
3.0,Too large for my son.
5.0,"I wear these almost everyday of the year in Alaska. I do a moderate amount of outdoor labor. They'll last about a year. Wear them every other day, they'll last two years. Worth it."
5.0,Comfortable and good looking.
3.0,Very happy with this product..
4.0,I followed an earlier review and ordered a waist size larger. Perfect fit. Very comfortable.
5.0,Fits great. Getting compliments at work!
2.0,I thought they're going to be the heavyweight heavy duty car hearts but they were not you're still good if you have to read small print next time
3.0,"Same fit, but they have gone to a much lighter weight fabric. I don't expect these to hold up like my previous pair."
5.0,"Jusr what we hoped for. color, fit, weight are perfect."
3.0,They are ok I have dickies carpenter jeans from Walmart that are thicker and more durable. I ordered 2 pairs the exact same size- one fit perfectly and the other was very tight in the waist. So be aware of the inconsistency
2.0,Sent back. Too large.
4.0,"I was looking for a fairly lightweight work pant that was a relaxed fit. These fit great and don't bunch up when I have to squat down. As I live in the deep south, they feel fairly light and not hot. I plan on buying several more"
4.0,These are the only pants my hubby will wear. I like that they last a long time even when he works in the shop
5.0,as expected
5.0,Washed well. Comfortable fit
5.0,Very satisfied with product purchased.
1.0,"I wear Carhartt all day, every day  Various models, all blue or duck.  I wear a 34"" waist (way too loose, but I wear many layers) and a tight belt.  Bought these in my usual size because I needed something a little more formal (this is as formal as I get) with ""normal"" colors.  I laundered with confidence, as I always do - cold wash/delicate dry - and was shocked when I put these on.  Way too tight in the waist could barely breathe.  I had two days of business to conduct so I wore them, regardless.  Have not worn since and will give to charity.  Had I not had some unexpected business, I would have returned.  Terribly disappointed."
5.0,These are great pants for work or casual wear. I would order up one size if you are on the fence as to what to choose.
5.0,Perfect in every way.  Quality - fit - shipping.
5.0,Great pair of pants.
3.0,"You never know how they are going to fit. I bought one pair a little to large and they fit great, next pair same size and I had to have them altered to fit in the waist. At forty bucks a pop (40) you would think quality control would be better!"
3.0,Very loose fit.
4.0,great pant
4.0,Very durable & comfortable.
1.0,"Ordered two new pairs, one pair was used with dog hair and no tags."
4.0,buy 1 size larger for these
4.0,"Good fit, good quality. I will be ordering another pair, like the variety of colors too."
5.0,The relaxed fit allows for extra room so order true to size or smaller as they don't shrink a whole lot.
3.0,"Got 35/32. Waist fine, legs very long. Nice quality."
1.0,Fit good
4.0,Fit as expected.
5.0,These pants fit perfectly. You choose your size and they come exactly the size you want them to be.
5.0,"Been wearing these jeans over a year now, so I can say they really last through countless wearings and washings. Comfortable, no loose threads, tough, and lots of pocket space. Will definitely buy again."
1.0,too small but not their fault
5.0,"Fit great, look great, feel great. I bought a couple other pairs and work with for my needs. Material is tough flr outdoor use but on pair got snagged on a corner and ripped a small whole quite easily but hasn't ripped further and still holding together quite well."
5.0,"Fits great, looks good. Handy pockets."
5.0,Perfect pants! Will be buying more for sure.
5.0,"These are great general purpose pants that I don't have to worry about abusing that I wear at work. I have another pair just like it that I use for home improvement projects. Light weight, comfortable, and according to my wife, easy on her eyes..."
3.0,Very low grade canvas.
5.0,The pants are great. I work in them daily and they hold up really good.
5.0,They're a little baggy but I'm going to wash them a couple of times then review again.
5.0,Like the way they fit
5.0,Great Jeans
4.0,"Good Pants, Seem pretty durable and still some what professional looking, depending on the seting."
5.0,Nice. Go Carhartt
1.0,Sizing is not  accurate.  The waste is 2 sizes to small. Seller return policys is very short.
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,Great jeans. Very durable.
5.0,quality as expected..
1.0,Sorry material cant believe these Carhartt
5.0,This is my second pair and I will be getting more. These are very comfortable and fit great. I have bigger athletic legs and they fit just fine.
3.0,My Husband loved these. Looked and fit great. But after only wearing them ONE day the rivet button on the pocket broke off.
5.0,"Nice work pants, medium weight, waist I little tight when first on but loosen to a perfect fit, waist also a little higher which is nice, length slightly long but acceptable, comfortable fit throughout the legs and seat.  Bought two pair of different colors both fit exactly the same.  Heavy duty seams, pants appear to be holding up well in my world of construction. Best all-around work pants for me currently, will buy again."
5.0,Been a carhartt person for many years.  Love them
5.0,Quality trousers.
4.0,"i am a 32 waist and i ordered a 33 just in case... and i have to say 33 still a little tight, nevertheless pants are good quality"
5.0,gave as a gift.  Apparently fits well as we haven't heard!
5.0,"Great fit, Good quality"
2.0,They look like his other Carhartt pants but the waist is an inch smaller.
5.0,Other than being too small
5.0,Love the way they fit and look on my husband.
5.0,These are my go-to pants for work. They present a nice product to wear in the office and also in the field for the construction industry. They are very comfortable and hold for decent for the amount of wear and tear I put them through. I continue to buy different color options.
5.0,Hubby loves this brand because it comes in a 35 waist.
1.0,"Material is cheap and the sizes are not accurate. I have 4 other pairs of work pants in both denim and canvas that all fit perfectly, but those exact dimensions in this product are too short and too narrow, both in waist and thigh. If you like loose fit,  I wouldnt waste time or money with this product, it fits like a regular/slim, especially in the thigh. Completely disappointed in this name brand product, I expect more."
5.0,"Summer pants! Thin (but durable) material. I got these for hubby for winter work pants. Nope! I am saving them for spring/summer. Thermals would be uncomfortable underneath as well. They fit nice and he looks pretty sexy in em, too!"
5.0,Great fit!
4.0,will buy again
5.0,"Husband who is a town worker loves them. They've been worn so much, you can't even see the original color in them, but not a single tare"
5.0,Product was dad described and was exactly what I was expecting.
5.0,"I have to wear khaki colored pants as part of my uniform for a construction company. As a big man, (61 & 275) Ive struggled to find pants that fit well. These have plenty of room the legs and thighs, seek to be pretty durable, and they come out of the dryer with no need to iron. These are now my go to work pants and I plan on ordering more next pay day."
5.0,Very high quality and super comfortable to work in for hours. Durable and well designed pockets for the tradesman...
5.0,Always the best.
5.0,Should have ordered a size up! Was a little tight!
5.0,Love these pants!  Bought two more pair. :)
3.0,"little high in price, stiff material but hopefully that will change after several washes"
5.0,"My husband really likes the fit of these pants and the fact that they are not as heavy as the regular ones.  I think they wear out a little faster,but not enough to complain about."
4.0,"Nice pants, good fit."
4.0,had to return.  pants were to small.  I am ordering again larger size.
5.0,"Very nice fit.  Comfortable,  rugged, durable.  Love these pants."
5.0,
1.0,"Ordered a pair of 32/34 pants and the waist was no where near a 32, more like a 26.."
5.0,"I have to wear these for work. Pretty durable, very comfy and the side pockets are sized just right. I usually get a year of use from a pair of these. Only complaint=very rare to find these on sale"
5.0,Had a pair of these that were at least 4 years old with holes and couldn't find a better brand so ordered these. Got the new pair today and fit perfect! Would definitely order again!! Thanks
5.0,"Comfortable, well made and looks to be tough and long wearing. Useful number of pockets. Nice color."
4.0,Not as sturdy as their ripstop version but much softer and the style and size are consistent with other Carhartt pants I've purchased.  Will be good for  light duty jobs and for heading into town to the hardware store.
4.0,My favorite
5.0,"The fit is just right ,and the cell phone pocket is a good size. I will oder more"
5.0,"My husband LOVES these Carhartts.  They last and last and last.
I usually buy him some of these pants, albeit in different colors, every year for his birthday and Christmas."
5.0,Really like these for casual wear. Fit as expected and not too tight through the seat and the legs
5.0,Great pants
5.0,The fit is perfect.  Husband loves his new pants.  Will order more.
1.0,One sizes bigger than you have the right size
5.0,Super comfortable work pants with a good amount of pockets.
5.0,Great fit!
3.0,Light duty work pants would be 5 stars except zipper seems to constantly work itself open
3.0,Returned because they didn't fit but no problems with the return process.
3.0,great pants but sizes are off. in every other pants I've had I'm a 34x32. in these I'm a 36x30.
5.0,Very durable and look great. I work in construction and they hold up and fit very nice. A little tight at waist because I ordered a size smaller than needed.
1.0,"I ordered a 34 waist and the fit was closer to a 32 or a 30. Also, the fit was not ""loose"" as the description would lead you to believe. The upper thigh and seat were far too tight, and the knee/shin area was far too loose. It seems like that should be the other way around. Don't be like me, try these on in a store before ordering."
4.0,Works great. Use them while doing tree work and landscaping. No issues. In good rotation they will last a year + of hard work
5.0,Great quality and fast!
3.0,"Bummer. Nice pants. Comfortable. Fit well. But... my iPhone 6 Plus is about one inch too long for the ""cell phone pocket"". I sat down and my phone dropped out right away. Total deal breaker. These will be returned. Hey Carhartt, a couple inches of material added to the cell phone pocket would make these useable for a whole lot of people who use larger sized smartphones."
5.0,"As with most Carhartt men's clothing, you have to be careful on sizing and these pants are no different. If you normally wear a 32, you will have to go with a 33. 32 will be too small, and 34 too big! Other than that, Great pair of work pants."
4.0,"Quality is good, but the fit is too small around the waist."
5.0,I bought these for work in an industrial setting. Nice loose fit let's me move easily. Grey color is good for hiding stains.
4.0,Husband loves these. Comfortable and durable. Likes the pockets.
3.0,Loved the quality & ordered 5 pants & 1 lined overall that are all too small?! They run small & its incredibly inconvenient.
5.0,Fits great. Got another pair for work.
5.0,Excellent pants
2.0,"Watch the fit! Measured against a pair of Gap pants that fit well. These were way too small in waist, way too long in length.  I wear a 34/30, in these, would be 37x27!"
5.0,Durable and comfy work pants. Fit as expected.
5.0,my husband won't wear anything else. They last a long long time before they are wore out.
4.0,The loose fit we're tighter than the regular fit
5.0,These are a little lighter weight than the original carhartt- so they are great for warmer weather but still the durable rugged material.
5.0,"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length."
4.0,They seem pretty durable. I like them. They fit good.
5.0,Wonderful fit.
5.0,Best pants around for a tall skinny guy. Ones of the few brands that has a variety of sizes for people over 64.
4.0,After reading other reviews order 42 waist instead normal 40.  Glad I did 4 stars cause apparently the 42 or like a normal 40
3.0,"THE WAIST AND SEAT FIT PERFECTLY, THE LEGS  WERE WIDER AND A LITTLE LONGER THAN I,M USE TOO. WIILL WERE THEM IN THE WINTER WITH LONG JOHNS."
5.0,Bought for my husband and is exactly what we expected!
1.0,The baggiest pair of pants Ive ever had.  These pants are like acworking mans bell bottom.  No tailoring or trim look.  Not what I expected. I won't get these again
5.0,"good material, durable feeling."
5.0,Love these pants
5.0,"Great pants, just a bit long,"
3.0,Much too baggy for my liking
4.0,They are as presented.
3.0,Did not fit like expected.
5.0,I bought these for my father in law and he loves them bop
5.0,Great product. Fits exactly. Rugged material.
5.0,Love these pants. More $ than what I usually wear but I wanna buy a shi$ton of them. So comfortable and pockets are good size. Side pocket fits can of grizzly perfectly. Cheaper and better than the bro brand Duluth trading.
5.0,Comfortable work pants
4.0,A little tighter in the waist than expected and pretty baggy legs overall. Great quality though for work pants.
3.0,The pants are some what more baggy than expected. But when I opened the bag for the pants it smelled like poop.
4.0,Nice pants!
5.0,Very nice men's work pants and so much cheaper to purchase here on Amazon then at the local Tacoma work wear Store but I highly recommend if you wear a size 40 then get 1 size bigger because even though it's a really nice pair of pants it runs small and unfortunately I'm having to send back mine and having a place a reorder of the correct size so it's unfortunate because it's a inconvenience but as we all know it's simple to letting Amazon know the status and issues and getting a refund and then having to Place another order for the exact same pants just a size bigger.
5.0,I love these pants. Very sturdy and not too heavy for California weather.
5.0,They are awesome. They fit great. Durable and light weight. I love them
5.0,If you need loose pants then these are for you.
3.0,Going to have to return these. I'm not sure if they were labeled wrong or just run much smaller then my other pant but these came no where near to fitting me. Carhartt has been a quality brand in the past and I've never has this issue
4.0,Little longer than my size. I'm normally a 34x34 but the pants feel like a 34x36 (little too long)
4.0,Fits as expected and delivered as promised.
4.0,Great pants.. really hold up! True to size
4.0,I expected the knees to hold up a little longer that 6 months before getting a hole in them. I guess that's what the double knee is for......
4.0,"These are my first pair of Carhartts. They fit a bit snug at the waste, but loosens a bit after some wear. The fabric is strong, but not harsh to the touch. Beware of the technology pocket! The hammer loop rests just above the technology pocket. If you are not looking, you might mistaken the loop for the pocket and drop your phone."
5.0,"Very comfortable, room in the legs to move, lighter"
5.0,The right fit for the job. Somewhat thinner than other duck pants but very good quality. Comfortable to walk around in.
5.0,Great stuff...
5.0,These pants fit as expected
5.0,Fits great
5.0,Very satisfied with the product!
5.0,Fits as expected
5.0,"just right fit and great brand, always a good buy with carhartt"
3.0,Waist is smaller than labelled size
3.0,The pictures are deceiving these pants fit  too loosely.
2.0,Way to big in the waist
5.0,They don't make my butt look big
5.0,Baggy like the 90's jeans.  will buy again!
5.0,Husband loves them and there holding up nicley?
5.0,"Its Carhartt, Quality work pants that lasts for years."
5.0,Love these Carhartts. This is my favorite material. Not too stiff. And the pockets are great for your cell phone etc. I wear a pair to work everyday. I buy 3 pairs every year and toss them out when they're done. Perfect for hard working guys.
5.0,Really nice pants. Fit just right.
5.0,"Great work pants, wear them every day while working in tough conditions. Couldnt ask for a better pant."
5.0,I have the same pants in Tan too.
1.0,it's a shame that they still is the name Carhartt.
3.0,I returned these as the fit was too loose in the legs. Waist was spot on.
4.0,My son purchased
1.0,This is my second pair. The first time I bought my size and they were too tight. The second pair I bought I ordered one size too big but then after the wash they also became too tight. I really wish I could use this pants but I'm afraid to buy 2 sizes up.
5.0,"We live in Las Vegas, my husband prefers these over all other work pants.  To keep him cooler in the desert heat."
4.0,"Pants seem put together well. I'm 5"" 11"" and 180. medium build. Pants seem a little droopy in the crotch. Guess it depends when you where them on your waist. Would be nice to have a flap over the cell phone pocket. It just feels a little loose and could fall out when riding bike or motorcycle. I ride and I don't feel comfortable leaving the phone in the cell pocket. Need a secure flap with some Velcro or button. Other than that ... good pants. I bought 2 pairs , mushroom and coal."
5.0,My husband liked these so much that he bought more! Great product!
3.0,"Great pants however when we received them along with 2 other pants we washed them.
They did not fit. When I measure them instead of a 42 waist they were a 36 waist.
I suggest you measure them before washing. The maker put the wrong label inside- not the sellers fault."
5.0,Perfect fit. My go to work pant.
5.0,My husband loves them for work.
3.0,Loose fit cut not as generous as expected. 36 waist more like 35.5.
4.0,Nice pants but runs small!!
5.0,Best Pants great price!!
5.0,Great fit
5.0,"Love these pants, I'm a big guy, 6' 1"" 290lbs and these have lasted me a year so far and construction is not easy on clothing"
5.0,Bought for my son and he loves the comfort and fit of pants.
5.0,Setting a goal to fit into.
2.0,To long
5.0,Nice fit
1.0,I've ordered several pairs of these pants over the past few years. These recent ones are smaller than the rest and have no tag. They also feel like a different material. Took them to a local store to compare them to the ones they stock and they are very different. Showed a employee and they said they looked like knock offs. Further online research and they were indeed knock offs. Sending them back.
5.0,"My hubby likes this. He is very comfortable working in a construction doing the squatting, bending, and stuff. I didn't regret I bought this as a gift for him."
5.0,I have seven pair now and they're a great fit and feel.
5.0,I use for work and it is very comfortable.  I will continue to purchase the Carhartt brand for work attire.
4.0,Carhartt pants run very small in the waist. I wear a 38-40/34 and I got 42/34 and the still.are snug
5.0,Everything as expected
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them for work...he is a welder.
5.0,"...and reasonably stylish.  Fit is pretty much like a normal pair of pants in the waist/hip/thigh.  By my estimation the ""loose fit"" part is the legs which are very roomy starting at the thigh through the bottom of the pant leg (this aspect of the pants doesn't seem obvious in the product pictures).  Anyway makes the legs kind of breezy/comfortable plus plenty of room for work boots but they also look fine with just regular shoes."
5.0,I love the beige it is perfect the fit is perfect couldn't ask for a better pair of jeans then this.
5.0,"These work pants are not only super comfortable, but they are also durable, & light
Weight. I'm a union Electrician, & they are my regular wear! "
5.0,"Great fit , very comfortable"
5.0,Great pair of summer work pants light but strong enough for the job.
5.0,I love these trousers -- very comfortable fit.  I have already bought a second pair.
5.0,"Bought for light work pants, they are not as heavy as original Carhart material. Perfect for light work, may not hold up well if you have to crawl around or have a tendency to wear jeans out quickly."
5.0,Great price. Saved $10 per pair versus local store. The paints do run a little small so it would be smart to buy one size up in waste size .
5.0,Great pant for casual dress work and play. The hammer handle is fairly understated so they look nice and wear well.
5.0,"can't really blame the sizing. i ordered the same size as a previous identical pair that I've had for years. thought i might need a little more room in the waist being that these are work pants. also I'm pretty sure that I'm a little bigger than when i ordered the last pair. ordered the next size and everything is good, great to work in in warmer weather."
5.0,I bought 4 different pairs of these pants in different colors. Carhartt pants tend to run a bit small in the waist so I would recommend getting one size up. I wear a 34 waist but got these in a 36 waist and they fit perfectly! The length is perfect. Great work pants!
2.0,"These are by far the worst five pocket jeans that I have purchased. There are two reasons for my decision. One, the cell phone pocket is placed such that in  a siting position, you are sitting on your cellphone, two, the front pocket depth is 2 "" shorter than other jeans,  say the 151."
4.0,"Standard carharrts but extremely baggy, especially around the thighs.  Nothing wrong with product, but returned because I was looking for a different fit."
5.0,Ordered wrong size
5.0,They fit well and are the quality I always expect fro Carhartt
5.0,"Look good, fit well and they're comfortable. Very durable"
4.0,"Waist size was perfect, but the length was longer than expected. Overall very nice pair of jeans."
5.0,Prefer them to Levi's.
5.0,Carhartt
5.0,Well made
5.0,I use these for work. They fit great and are a good balance between comfort and durability.
5.0,"Fit perfect, great color, know they'll last long."
5.0,Great work pants.  Fits as expected.
3.0,"Seems like they would be nice pants, but they are also cut much smaller than normal. I wear a 34 waist  and I couldn't even zip these up all the way, let alone close the button. So I'm returning them."
4.0,"Wore them for about a week now, working in a high volume kitchen. For the most part, they're a great pair of work pants so far, the cell phone pocket is a very nice addition seeing as I need to be in touch with a lot of people throughout the day. Hammer loops aren't necessary so I ended up cutting those off to reduce the risk of them getting caught on anything in the kitchen. Only gripe I have is that they do run a little larger, used my Levi 501 size and these feel really baggy and I have to roll the legs up a bit. But it's not a major detriment to the pants. I'll probably be buying a couple more pairs, just a size smaller then normal."
5.0,"Great quality, fits as expected."
3.0,The waist is smaller then my other  pants
5.0,He loves them
5.0,"I'm 6'3"" and about 160 lbs.  The 33x36 are perfect.  The material is great, too - a lightweight canvas.  It will hold some wrinkles from the laundry spin cycle, but I just fold them carefully and they're fine.  The right-hand utility pocket is big enough for my cell phone + case, which is 6.4x3.5x0.6 inches."
2.0,Did not fit as expected.
5.0,"Great pants, I have purchased these before from a local work-wear shop. HOWEVER, since the last time I bought a pair, Carhartt has changed their sizing. Old, beater pair of 38's still fit fine, new 38's were snug until washed, too tight after. Returning the 38's (Amazon's return process is incredible), and re-ordering 40's. There's a blow to the old self-esteem, but the pants are too good to let ego stand in the way. Cell phone pocket holds a Note 4 easily, other pockets very comfortably sized, and fairly wrinkle resistant."
4.0,"Extremely comfortable .  Move around easily at work.  Lighter than regular jeans, so good for warmer weather."
2.0,Ripped probably day 2 of having them. I was being wreck less but not overly wreck less at work so it kind of sucks to be in the trades expecting a good pair of pants and they rip off a splinter sticking out.
3.0,I'm sure they would have been great but they were way to long. I ordered a 30 length but they were more like 33 or 34.
3.0,5 stars if it was sized correctly.  I got the same pair in a different color and those fit perfectly... these ones run a bit small in the waist.  I wear 33W and I need 34W with these.
1.0,"I bought several carhartt jeans, two online and one in store. All of them fit except for this pair, at least 2 to 3 inches too small in the waist band."
3.0,Little bit full thru the legs almost baggy
5.0,Always been a diehard carhartt fan.
3.0,"Pants are great. Waist runs kind of small. I wear a 34 (which is big on me), these were pretty tight in the waist, maybe I got a misprint?"
4.0,They are a little longer than expected but overall my hubby still loves them and wears them. Very good quality.
5.0,"Fits me nicely, offers great range of motion, durable, comfortable as far as work pants go, and still presentable when not dirty. What else could you ask for in a pair of work pants?"
2.0,Large. But good quality pants.
5.0,"Very happy with my pants, I've been wearing carharts for 10 years, they beat Levi's hands down"
5.0,I'm a diabetic that takes insulin shots in the thigh so I've been searching for a reasonable pair of pants that I can pull up fairly high for taking injections in public. Taking a shot in a standard pair of jeans is an absolute pain in the ass so these things make my life much easier. Plus they give my balls some room too so they're not constantly being squished. I returned and bought 3 more pairs. Normally I wear 34x34 so after reading the sizing comments I went with 36x34 and they fit perfectly!!!
5.0,"great pants, fit well and high quality.  I will buy these again for sure."
2.0,Nice pants. At least a size smaller than i ordered.  Also they are flat fronts
5.0,Best pants ever & highly recommend!!
5.0,Good price for good work pants
5.0,Going to order mo re
5.0,First pair came defective. Second replacement pair are great. Very easy return process.
4.0,"If you want quality pants to work in, there is no better for the price."
5.0,"These were for my son who wears a 32x34 He said these were tight in the waist, and is hoping that these will loosen up with wear. The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit. I would recommend keeping the packaging and getting a size up as there has been a rash of too small Carharrt items lately, and with that said it is still worth the trouble to get ahold of these canvas slacks.
5 Stars A++ RECOMMENDED
VOTE thumbs UP IF YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL"
5.0,good work pants or casual wear if you want to look like a stud
3.0,"Before I ordered these pants in charcoal grey , I read some reviews and was advised to order a size ' up ' and it's a good thing I did. I wear a size 42 in the waist and ordered a size 44 and although they fit , they fit snug....very snug. The canvas material feels very , very thin , so keep that in mind if you're looking for a tough pair of work pants. For me....they'll be okay for casual wear."
5.0,My husband loves these for summer time working! Jeans are too hit for him but he says these are great!
5.0,"I have a hard time finding pants with the correct combination of fit in the waist and room in the thigh. These fit me just right. I own several pair and they hold up well. I have a difficult time finding them in stores, so Amazon and done."
5.0,"Just a little long.  Other than that ,  perfect."
3.0,Looks fine.
5.0,Carhartt is the best in class
3.0,not a medium duty canvas work pant
5.0,"Fit just like I wanted. Love these with the cell phone pocket and hammer loop. I don't need the tool bag as much with these pants. Built tuff, I have a hard time wearing them out. I just wish they were a little cheaper but in this case you do seem to get what you paid for."
5.0,Fast delivery. Got these for my husband to wear at work. Great product.
5.0,"Great pants, we will see how durable they are in the future."
5.0,Great
4.0,"Great work pants but as a 155 lb 6'2"" skinny dude they are a little baggy. Should fit well for people bigger than myself."
3.0,"31 too small around waist, there are better carhartt pants."
2.0,"I am a 32x32 in all shorts and jeans. I ordered this at 32x32 and couldn't even button them. I then ordered a 34x32 and they fit good but too tight for a belt. Now, I need to re-order them at 3532!!! Very frustrating..."
5.0,I'm a big fan of these pants. I have several pairs and the origin of manufacturing of the last few pairs was Mexico. The two best things about these is the fit and the cell phone pocket which is below the normal pocket a fair distance away from your gonads.
2.0,"Sizing is way off, smaller, significantly, even without washing, than existing Carhartts I have with the same nominal size. Unfortunately, I left them sitting, unworn, in their bag and missed the 30 day return window. Buyer beware ....."
5.0,Husband is a logger. This is the only pants he will wear to work! He gets extremely dirty and works in the woods everyday. Pants hold up wash after wash! Great for men who have heavy duty jobs!
5.0,"Been wearing them for the last 5 years. I'm a maintenance supervisor and they wear well, takes punishment and in the wash and they come out good as new."
4.0,"Nice pants, probably should have ordered a size down"
3.0,Nice but the waste seems like a 34 and the length seems like a 36
3.0,"Great pants but order 1-2 waist sizes larger. Yeah, I know. Also, if you can magically shrink your man hands to the size of a six year old girl's hands, it'll help in getting your keys and wallet out of the pockets."
4.0,too wide
5.0,husband's favorite pants - ordering more
5.0,Great product as always
5.0,"Hi!! I'm Stephanie and work for Doug, a plumber.  I found this style of work pants for him and ordered them many years ago and now he won't wear anything else but these!! Nothing even comes close to them.  He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these...it really made my day! :) Everything about them...he loves but the pockets are the real deal for him!  He loves the way that they curve! So over the years, I've continued to purchase these pants for him along with the same style shorts with the same pockets.  It really breaks my heart that the shorts are no longer available to get.  He worries that he won't be able to get the pants one day as well... so please keep on selling them.  If anyone knows where I can get the Carhartt Men's Canvas Utility Shorts....please let me know!! I've searched the whole internet and still have not been able to locate any of them anywhere :(!! My boss is very upset about that too! I've even called Carhartt head quarters trying to see if they would just make him several years supplies for him but they could not do it! :( I pray that these pants will stay in stock and not be unavailable because my boss will not be a happy man and neither will I because I will have to listen to him complaining everyday about his work pants like he is already complaining about not being able to get the shorts anymore because they are not making them anymore!  Thanks for 2 great items and hopefully those shorts will be made available to purchase again very soon so that I can be happy and my boss can be too! :)  Thanks and have a great day! :) By the way....We both give this product a 5 STAR!!!! *****"
3.0,"Hmmm. Well the pants fit great. I have a problem with the pant legs pockets layout. I'm used the right pocket holding my spare pencils, instead that's the pocket they designed for a cellphone. Then they put the hammer loop right above it, so every time I went to get my cellphone my hand would get slightly entangled in the loop.  I solved the problem with the loop by cutting it off. Only giving three stars because of the leg pocket layout,  which is not a big deal, but it could go up if they hold up to the wear and tear of my work."
1.0,They wear like pajama pants
5.0,"the best, in spite of the price. my daily work pant for almost a year......  3-5 days a week.... fully loaded pockets, all stitching has remained intact."
2.0,"I bought the same size as I do other pants but this fit snug before washing.  If you buy these, get them larger than normal."
2.0,"Bought one pair and fit great , ordered 2 more and didn't even come close to fitting"
5.0,Awesome jeans will buy again
4.0,"The pants are unbelievably durable, yet lightweight and somewhat stylish. Great for different uses and different climates. The side pockets on carpenter pants are very useful, without the pockets sticking out like cargo pants.

I'm docking one star because the sizes are all wrong. I have size 36 waist pants from other brands, that are a looser fit than the 2 pairs of size 40 Carhartt pants I bought. Size 40 fits fine, but Carhartt's ""36"" would have been impossible for me to wear. The company should really look into correcting their measurements. Just a head's up."
4.0,Very durable and comfortable.
1.0,Too
5.0,Love it!
5.0,"Man I love these pants. I highly recommend ditching the blue jeans for work and getting these.
I will be sure to update this as the months past if they become defective or unusable in anyway.  If this review has helped in anyway please hit the helpful button. Thank you."
5.0,"Would take these canvas pants any day over jeans! Way more comfortable, easier to move around in, more breathable, and they last longer! As with all Carhartt pants they fit a little slim compared to other brand pants."
3.0,These would be great pants if it were not for the damn fool hammer loops. Don't suppose one in one thousand use them for a hammer and if it is a fashion statement that would be incredibly lame.
5.0,he loves them
3.0,"If for everyday wear, you will have to be buying more very soon..."
3.0,Ordered a 33 waist maybe got a 31
5.0,The fit is just right for me.  I will buy another pair when I need them.
5.0,Fits perfect better then I thought
3.0,"Great fit in the leg (I have large legs) and as others said the waist is a bit tight so I ordered the next size up, I normally wear a 34x32 in Carhartt denim pants, so I got these in 35x32. These are noticeably tighter in the waist and I probably should have gotten a 36. The inseam was a bit long too; these are at least 1-2 inches longer when compared to the denim. Also, the seat feels a bit cramped when sitting.

Size aside, these are noticeably cooler (temperature) than denim. The leg pocket is a perfect fit for an iphone 6 without a case. They feel really well build, however the sizing is greatly different from Carhartt's denim sizing. I'm not certain I'll be ordering these again."
5.0,A little big at first but once washed they fit exactly like another pair of carhartt pants i have
3.0,Waist fits good legs baggier then expected
5.0,Best work pants ever!
2.0,Small stain on the front of the pants :( right out of the package. Not sure if these were a return item that someone else stained or if they were damaged in storage. The pants were in a sealed package with the stain
5.0,"I like these pants for working in the yard or working on the truck. I ordered a 36"" length because I am 6'5"" tall but they are about 2 inches too long. Either I am getting shorter or they are making pants longer. These pants are very comfortable and would recommend to others. I am going to buy another pair but will order a 34"" inseam instead of 36"""
5.0,these pants are comfortable and durable. Great for warm weather working.
5.0,"Love these so far. Fit great, lots of useful pockets, very comfortable. Hammer loops on both sides for us lefties. I'll report back in a few weeks to see how the knee area is holding up. That's usually the first to go on my work pants."
5.0,I love these pants they last forever!!!
4.0,Fit better than expected.
4.0,I didn't realize that these pants have rivets on them near the pockets. I constantly get my finger nails caught on them. The material that they're made out of is good for working in hot environments.
2.0,Ordered 1pair dark jeans 36X32 fit too loose.  When measured with tape inseam 33 in.  waist 37 in. left side  18 in right side 19in. Its like a 36 side was sewn to a 38 side. Had 1 hammer loop or right side.  Ordered light pair - the same except hammer loop on each side.  Both pair the rear seam is off center.  Ordered 34 hoping for good fit....nope 34 was a perfect 34 had to return them.  No more Carhartt for me...
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,My husband loves these for work. Fits great
5.0,Just what I hoped for...and lots of pockets! !!  Ordering another pair
5.0,"Very comfortable work pants with quality stitching and deep pockets.  Are a great pant for the summer since they are a thinner, cooler material than regular blue jeans.  Also the lighter color material doesn't get as hot in the sun and makes it easier to find crawling ticks."
5.0,"I'm 6'3"" 200#. They fit perfect"
2.0,"When they say loose fit, they mean loose fit."
4.0,Buy the next size bigger for the waist or they won't fit. Length is a touch long as well but ok.
2.0,"Legs are too wide, flapping wings or bell bottoms"
5.0,Very comfortable and light weight.  Lighter than B11's.  Good quality and durable.  My go to casual slacks
5.0,Great work pants.  Phone with protective case fits in deep pocket nicely. Washes  well.
3.0,"Comfortable, durable, well constructed.

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

Disappointing. I'm not going to through the pants out but I can not wear them for work."
5.0,Fit better than my levi's or wranglers and the material is great. Gonna be a great work pant. Yes Sir.
5.0,Good work pants. They last long and don't get torn easily
3.0,Definitely a loose fit.
5.0,Great pants to brew beer in. Not as tough as the double front variety but not as expensive.
3.0,Sadly don't last very long before starting to rip best works pants they just don't last i have gone trought 3 pairs of these while I'm on my first pair of dikeys that Are still going strong
5.0,Just what we were looking for. Perfect
5.0,These are amazing!  Bought for my son and he instantly had a smile on his face when he put these on.  Very comfy!!
5.0,Good fit.
4.0,Tighter in the legs and crouch areas then the other types of loose fitting paints that I have bought.
5.0,"This is about the 10th pair I have bought for my husband, no complaints."
5.0,The best feature of these pants is the ability to put an iPhone 7 Plus in the lower right side pocket. I wish more manufacturers would make pants like these.
5.0,good quality
5.0,Great work pants
2.0,My son loves all Carhartt clothing for work but he is a 28x32 which is a hard size to find. He has three pair that fit him well. These did not. Too long and too big!!
3.0,"The waist, butt, crotch fit fine, but the length is short for me.  I have other Carhartts and they are fine for length, these just don't have the length I want."
5.0,
5.0,"Great pants, comfortable and looks great."
2.0,"generally, fit was good. However, unless you have tiny hands, you'll never be able to use the front pockets. My hands are about average for my height, I usually wear a medium large glove,so I cant understand this oversight in design."
3.0,"The pants looked great, but were tighter than the shorts of the same waist made by Carhartt. I have had cheaper denim jeans that have lasted longer without tearing in the crotch. The material was thin and was easy to tear. These work pants barely lasted the winter season."
4.0,I already had a pair of these from a year ago and the new pair is a bit different.  The side pocket is a little bigger and they fit a bit tighter around the waste than my original pair did (and no I didn't gain weight).  Great pair of pants tho.
4.0,Ordered wrong size.
5.0,My boyfriend is very athletically built and has a hard time finding pants that aren't too tight in the thighs and too big in the waist. These work great and look good.
3.0,"They r made small like the old hip huggers years ago. How can I return them to get regular jeans.
  Ron"
5.0,"I've gotten these pants in the past, and my work is pretty rough on clothes. Definitely worth the extra money over other work pants, or just an old pair of jeans"
2.0,"As stated in other reviews, sizes are off.  Mine are marked ""made in Nicaragua.""  I usually wear a 36 in other Carthartt.  Bought a 38 because of reviews.  Still too tight in the waist.  Lots of room in the legs though."
5.0,Bought these for my husband and they fit perfect.
5.0,"Nice, durable. Quick delivery."
4.0,"Nice pants, they are sized small in the waist and long on the length. They still fit but I wouldn't call them loose fit"
4.0,Legs to large
5.0,A great pair of pants!
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,"love these pants! perfect sized pockets in perfect locations. I conceal carry and I found the pockets are excellent for extra magazines/knives/multi-tool. super comfortable and durable. They feel stiff when you first get them but, like denim, wear in nice and provide comfort and toughness"
5.0,carhart quality as usuall.u can find cheap immitations but that's what they are cheap.i am a welder and no other pants hold up like these.
5.0,Perfect for my son who is 6'5.  They fit perfectly and wear very well.  He wears them for work on the farm.
1.0,Did not fix as expected. Very short and shrunk terribly
5.0,Awesome fit and super comfortable. Hands down the best pair of work pants you will ever own.
1.0,too small and I was too lazy to return
5.0,I really like these pants. Fit loose and hokd around the waist nice. Good Durability.
5.0,very well made nice fit
4.0,"A little snug, recommend getting one size bigger"
5.0,"Comfortable, durable nice looking work pants. Fit is true to size and very comfortable."
5.0,Perfect fit and great quality as always.
4.0,Good trou.  Feel good.  Look good.
5.0,Carhartt sizes seem a bit on the smaller size. Tough to find the in-between perfect fit. I do like them though. Try them out.
2.0,"These are my ""go to"" pants for everyday wear. Sometimes I can't find them locally, so I thought I'd try through Amazon. The fit was very poor. They were too tight in some places and too loose in others. When I buy them locally, the fit is fine. I don't know where these pants were made, but I suspect that has something to do with it. The material also turned out to be very different from what I wanted. These pants were a heavy duck material, and I prefer the lightweight khaki material. When I returned them, I got a note suggesting that the post office wouldn't deliver.....odd!"
5.0,my favorite work pants
4.0,Was good
2.0,did not fit me right
1.0,Received the pants + Too large + Send it back + Get $6 less than paid for in a refund = 1 star review
2.0,Too baggy
3.0,I like these pants.  Been buying them for years now. I probably have 15 old pairs and every single pair has a hole in the right knee. They only last about 5 to 6 months then bam!  Hole in the knee. Like clock work
5.0,He loved them! Will be ordering more!!!
5.0,"These fit as expected, I like them, I like the pocket for the phone another for the wallet another for the knife, etc"
5.0,Glad they fit perfect and didn't have to send them back.
4.0,Good fit
5.0,Good pants not as thick material as the older ones but still good.
4.0,"comfortable, lightweight"
3.0,Ok but not loose enough in the legs and seat.
4.0,The color looked more gray online
3.0,Ordered my proper size against best advice. Way to small. Had to reorder larger. Pants are fine. Just figure out your sizing carhart.
5.0,I bought these for my husband. This is the second pair I bought him. They are great for work on hot days.
5.0,I knew what size I needed already so the fit is perfect!
5.0,"Great work pants, well made with good weight fabric. All the pockets you need."
5.0,"Great product,"
5.0,Love these pants:)
4.0,Good quality.
5.0,These are the only pants I wear anymore.
5.0,These are the best fitting work/casual pants. I'm tall and thin/athletic and it's hard to find a pant that isn't too baggy or tight and that's the right leg length. I like them so much I bought another exact pair.
5.0,love them
5.0,Best work pant I've ever owned!  Comfortable and durable!
4.0,Order three inches larger than your waist size.
5.0,"Good pants, hate there not made in the USA anymore."
5.0,Awesome work pants. Very durable but looks sharp and professional.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted in two days!
4.0,I like the pant. The large range is sizes is great as I wear a 34 x 36 which are hard to find.
4.0,"I like the pants but these were shorter than my other Carhartts 30"" inseam and seemed tighter in the waist"
5.0,"love the pants. construction and build are of quality, but the waist is a bit on the tight size. i will probably only be able to wear for a year."
5.0,"I wasn't sure how I'd like the navy color, but I like it a lot"
4.0,NICE
5.0,"Fast shipping, and great product!"
3.0,Run a little bit smaller. I barely can close the button.
5.0,Love them
5.0,fantastic pants.  love the cell phone pocket and durable fabric.  wears well
5.0,Very comfortable. Fit as expected.
2.0,Ordered my regular size. Way to small. Ordered once size bigger and i'm swimming in them.
5.0,fits just right!
5.0,husband loves them.
5.0,"These look nice enough for a casual day at the office but are rugged enough for camping, yard work, etc. As comfortable as an old pair of jeans. Big fan of the side phone pocket. My iPhone 7 fits perfectly. I wear a hard to find size (33W x 36L) and these guys make it very easy to find my size in whatever style I'm looking for."
4.0,"Other than fit in waist, I really like the pants.  would order an inch larger if I had it to do again."
1.0,"Horrible. Ordered a size larger and still did not fit.
Sad... carhart was my favorite but not anymore.
AVOID.!!"
5.0,"Great pants, use them a lot working in the garage.  Cell phone in one side pocket and pliers,or knife, or some other tool in the other.  Hold up great, this is my 2nd pair, still using the first pair... just needed another for when they are in the wash."
5.0,Great pants
4.0,"The only thing I did NOT like was that the very top & one side of the cell phone pocket was NOT sewn to the the pant leg!! VERY annoying when walking around on job site all day, had to take to my seamstress & she FIXED the problem for me!! CARHARTT, the very BEST work clothes made but there is always room for improvement. So this is the reason y'all didn't get 5 stars. This is the second review I've written to y'all & if I don't hear back it is the last cause there will NOT be a strike Three!!! This is what y'all get when your clothes are made in MEXICO, PLEASE BRING BACK Y'ALL'S FACTORIES TO AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,thinly made but super comfy
4.0,Just a lil bit tight of the waist.
5.0,Will buy again
5.0,Great work jeans.
4.0,"I had to return, they run small in waste but true in length, for example, I wear a 34/32 I would have to order a 36/32 to fit in waste. I wear Levi jeans hope it helps someone in sizing"
5.0,Tears  easy. Won't last thru the season
5.0,fits exactly the way I thought they would.  Good quality clothing
4.0,Great pants. Just too snug. very durable
4.0,"Great pants, loose around the thigh. Waist runs a little small. Order one size larger than you normally wear and you'll be good to go."
4.0,"Great work pants. Or all around pants, really. Lighter than the other carhartts I own. Good fit."
5.0,Have several pair. All are very comfortable and fit well. Lighter weight than some of the other series.
5.0,"FAST SHIP, GREAT GIFT"
5.0,Great pants
5.0,"Okay so I originally bought these in a 32 30 and they were too short, so then I returned and bought a 32 32 and they were too long. I think Carhartt has weird sizing so it may take a few tries to find what fits you right, but its great quality and worth the money."
5.0,"These are the only pants my son has worn for a couple of years.  They are a heavy weight, but not as stiff and heavy as some of the other Carhartt pants.  He is picky and he thinks they are very comfortable."
5.0,Great pant love the color fit perfect  shipping fast
5.0,Perfect for my husband
5.0,Perfect fit  and material.
5.0,Love them!!!
5.0,These were a Christmas Gift and he really likes them. He says they are very comfortable.
4.0,"Great winter time golf pants, plenty of room for long underwear ,,, I will buy more of these if they ever get the color moss green."
5.0,My husband loves them
5.0,Very well made!
5.0,"Handy product, gives a great place for a cell phone. Comfortable and acceptable for daily business casual wear."
5.0,He loved the fit.  Very comfortable material.
5.0,My husband loves these. Great quality
5.0,Great pants. Soft AND COMPTORABLE

5.0,"Great color, fit and style for work."
5.0,Fit great. Look great.
4.0,"I am usually size 36 waist (32 unseen). I ordered 38x32 to be safe and am glad I did. They fit with no room to spare. I have bigger than average legs, and these pants are very comfortable in the legs. They are thin, but feel well made. I'm happy with them."
5.0,Sent to my son in the AF in ND.  Came in in time and fit perfectly.  Heavy material and rugged.
5.0,"Fits well, good pockets. I'm a commercial electrician and since buying my first pair a couple years ago, there has been no reason to try other work pants."
5.0,Great pants and live up to the brand name well
4.0,"Nice, comfortable pants for work or casual wear."
4.0,"Pants are great quality and very nice pants, only negative is that Carhardt must run small because every other pair of 34x30 are loose fitting but these are snug. Yet still a great pair of quality pants"
5.0,The first pair were a little big in the waist. This pair fits perfectly!
5.0,So far so good
5.0,"Great pants.  Durable, look good, super comfortable, big pockets!!"
3.0,"I wear a 34 waist in my Levi's so I bought the same in these pants, they arrived and feel just as durable as the rest of Carhartt's products however the 34 waist was quite smaller than my Levi's, I returned them and got the 35 waist, they arrived and they are still tighter than my Levi's. I bought 2 pair but may return the second pair after testing the first pair further."
4.0,"they do not have 37W-31L, so I bought 38W-32L and tried to shrink.  still a bit large."
5.0,Perfect fit. Perfect length.
5.0,"Perfect weight, comfortable and durable."
4.0,I would have to go a waist size larger to fit an inside the waistband holster.
5.0,"Solid product, good service, thank you."
5.0,All good!
1.0,ordered 5 pairs... one was the wrong color. who would buy these pants if in bulk if they were not for a job or something.. why sub the wrong color. now i got to deal with a return.
4.0,Nice
4.0,"Not as heavy weight material as I expected, but they look good and fit well."
4.0,Satisfied
4.0,I have some older Carhartts and ordered the same size as those pants and these ran a little bit smaller. I can still wear them but they are more snug.
3.0,Length is a bit short. I'll order 30 x 32 next time.
5.0,EXCELLS.
5.0,excellent quality durable and better than the rest
4.0,"Love them, I've bought many pairs just wish the would last longer"
5.0,"This cut is for below the wais by design by Carhartt - and as such they fit as expected. Nice loose fit on the legs.

Do remember to check Carhartt's guides as the ""Regular"", ""Relaxed"", ""Loose"" aren't just the diameter - they affect where the belt sits. Above, at, or below the natural waist.

With a few more chest pounds than I'd like I need the belt just below the natural waist . This ""Loose Fit"" is designed to sit right there."
5.0,Perfect fit great work pockets
2.0,These pants certainly are not loose fitting. Very poor representation by Carhartt.
5.0,I love Carhartt pants on my husband! They fit better than any other brand he has worn. Great quality! Highly recommend!
4.0,It is always hard for me too find a pair of trouser that fit right.  These do just right.
4.0,"I normally wear a size 42x30 in jeans, however when I received my pair of these Carhartts they were much too small. They couldn't be buttoned, so I was forced to send them back and get a size larger. I'm currently waiting for the replacements now. However, I do like these pants, quite a bit. Its obvious that they are really well made, and are sturdy for day to day work. I was a bit bummed that they didn't fit, but i liked them enough to re-order another pair. When I receive them, i'll be sure to give my final verdict. Until then, Four stars all the way."
5.0,Soft and comfortable.  Will purchase again
5.0,The best work pants I've got! Worth the money for sure! Better than dickies for sure!
5.0,I bought these for my son  for his work and  had them sent directly to him.  He said they wash nicely and are very sturdy ...fit was pervect..
5.0,They seem to be well made. Will buy another pair.  They seem to run small. I take a 34-35 bought a 34 and returned them and got 36 waist.
5.0,Great
5.0,Purchased these pants to replace a worn out pair of carhartt pants that were my husband' s favorite work pants. He was very happy with the fit- true to size. Will be ordering more of these. Satisfied customer.
5.0,Cool
2.0,Fit EXTRA loose
5.0,"Excellent fit. Love the fabric. It's a great everyday pant. If I worked outside everyday in the summer, I'd go with these. If I needed something to work in colder weather, I'd look for something a little thicker."
4.0,They're pants and they fit correctly.  Is that enough for you?!
5.0,"Nice pants, easy through the thigh, multiple hammer loops, cell phone pocket."
5.0,Love these pants
4.0,These were slightly smaller than the same thing I purchased 2 years ago.
5.0,Just what I  wanted!
5.0,"always wrinkled after drying, but they are just work pants so I don't care"
4.0,I ordered one size bigger after reading the reviews that seem to work out about right
5.0,Great
4.0,"Typically I would assume pants like this would be fairly heavy and not practical for wearing in the summer. These are actually quite light weight, to the point I do wish they were somewhat thicker as I am afraid the thin material may affect their longevity. All seams are triple sewn so should hold together fairly well however."
5.0,"Pants fit great and look even better, expected to last a long time"
5.0,I love the style but the waste is too small.
3.0,fit somewhat small in waist compared to other pants of same size...maybe they will stretch...or shrink with washing
5.0,"love these pants they are now the only ones i rock at work, play, and the occasional riot only kidding cause i'm working for a living WORKIN"
3.0,These are comfortable pants. They are 100% cotton so I'm not sure how long they will last if you are doing outdoor work or looking for a pant that will be rugged. I'm also not sure where they get these pants sized because they are far from correct. I wear a 32 waist jean and 32-33 waist in slacks. I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans. The length seems to run about an inch or so long but you can shrink them. So length isn't really a issue. I suggest if buying to be prepared to way over size the waist size by at least 3-4 inches.
5.0,"GREAT pants!  Carhartt makes a great pair of pants.  Wear like iron, pockets everywhere I need them."
5.0,Perfect!
4.0,"Decent work pants.
Good price.
Carhartt makes a few different pants some seem a bit more heavy duty but these are good late fall early spring pants for the  job sight."
2.0,Had some 32's from a friend I liked but were a tad small. Tried 33's and felt like I was swimming in them.
5.0,"The comfort of these pants is perfect and the size was spot on. The material seems soft but durable, and the color is pretty much what I expected. These are for work and I can see these lasting for a few years easy."
5.0,"These pants are the only pants I wear to work, they take a beating!"
5.0,Looks & fits good
5.0,"My favorite work pants, been wearing these for years. The quality and fit keep being great and the pockets are used on a daily basis!"
4.0,Wearing them right now. No regrets.
2.0,"I have a closet full Carhartts in the exact same size and cut, but these were both too small and too short."
5.0,Fit as expected-perfect for work!
5.0,They're great
5.0,My favorite style and fit of pants
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,Good product
5.0,Great pants! Could wear these everyday.
2.0,"Returning back, size is way smaller than it says.  But Amazon will refund your money very easily!!!"
5.0,"Not many pants work for me in the field I'm in, either don't fit right or they're too uncomfortable. Until I found these. Fit great, feel great, I'm happy!"
5.0,Nice and cool good fit
4.0,No surprises.  A good pair of pants for work.
1.0,too big
5.0,"great , no more levis"
4.0,"The waist size is about a full size small, I bought a 36 waist and fits me like a 34 (tight).  The legs and seat are loose and provide good freedom of movement.  The front pockets are a little small at the top; I have big hands (wear XL gloves) and they are tight getting them into the front pockets but not a huge problem.  The cell phone pocket holds my iPhone 6s with Lifeproof case with some room to spare.  I've only had them a few days so I can't comment on durability yet."
5.0,Good pants
4.0,Nice pants. It's hard to find pants with a cell phone pocket that aren't jeans. I carefully cut the hammer loops off for a nicer look in the office. They do shrink over a few washes. I had to re buy at the next size up on waist and length.
5.0,My hubby loves them!
5.0,For my son only complaint I have heard is that when he is out in the woods the briars go right through the fabric.
5.0,"Great looking pants, good buy for the price."
4.0,They fit fine. I like them
5.0,As expected....Great looks and feel. Carhartt has always done well with my purchases and this is no exception. I'm hard on work pants and these hold as well or better than most.
5.0,Awesome
5.0,Great pair of pants. Phone pocket is big enough to fit a large smart phone in a case. I am buying more in the near future.
5.0,"Sizing is perfect, love the dual hammer loops, very roomy fit and light weight but seems like they will hold up....also very cool leg pockets. These are great pants..... Also reasonably priced.... Great job Carhartt!
Also want to note I'm glad they are not a very heavy weight fabric...
Who wants to walk around sweating all day??"
4.0,"These pants are typical Carhartt quality, durable and comfortable."
5.0,Durable for my husband work
5.0,Yes satisfied with all my purchases.
3.0,Not crazy about the fabric
4.0,"Everything to be expected out of a pair of Carhartts.  They hold up well to a hard day of work day in and day out.  The color I have hides dirt and grease very well.  My only complaint if any would be that the buttons on Carhartts don't go far enough past the zipper,  my zipper is constantly creeping down as I stand and crouch."
5.0,great pants; normal styling; sturdy fabric; nice color; good value
4.0,Size ran a touch small. Front pockets could be deeper. Phone pocket needs to be deeper. Also should add a closure on this pocket to hold phone in. Will probably purchase again only because they closely match a uniform pant that I am required to wear.
4.0,works
4.0,Felt like I was forced to order a size larger than I expected based on the reviews. I feel like a 36 would have been perfect. But I am making do with the 38s. It ensures I have plenty of room to move around for rock climbing. If I had dropped down they may have been to restrictive.
5.0,Comfortable and lightweight.
5.0,"love these pants. i am a female and wear a women's size 6, i buy a size 30x32 in these and they fit great. wash and dry in the dryer well, no shrinking."
5.0,Great pants. Very light and durable too.
1.0,"So they fit, they're nice enough... but I use these pants for work. These pants are noticeably thinner than the other three pair of the exact same Carhartt pants I have. I have jeans thicker than what was shipped to me . I'm not sure why you're buying Carhartt, but I'm buying for durable work pants. What I received are cheap thin ""canvas"" pants which read 100% cotton made in Mexico. I understand ""canvas"" is now double woven cotton but these pants feel like gap khaki's which are very thin compared to all of my other Carhartt pants. I actually have Dickies thicker than these. I'd avoid these unless you are aiming at some sort of trendy hard worker look."
5.0,These pants are great work pants.
4.0,good fit
5.0,Very pricey for work pants but they do last. So you get what you pay for.
4.0,"Material and quality is great as I would expect from Carhartt. However, I wear 34W 32L on all pants and these were small on the waist and long on the leg in a 34W 32L."
4.0,Perfect fit. My cell phone (with case) fits perfectly in the the pocket on the right leg. I've been buying these pants for years. They get the soft feel after the first wash.
5.0,Had to return the first pair as they were a bit snug.  Not sure if they run a little smaller than other brands loose fit?  But they are high quality work pants.  Very happy with the purchase and the return process was a breeze.
5.0,I wear a 36 in most pants but this time I went with a 38 waist and Love them. Very comfortable....
5.0,"I own a pair in every color. I wear every day to work. I have several that are 7 years old,they take a beating and come back for more, I'm in the concrete business and nothing comes close."
4.0,A bit short in the leg length
5.0,Fit great.
5.0,Quality perfect very baggy though.  Still 5 stars for my mistake.
5.0,"This pants are excellent. They feel strong, yet not so stiff. Can't wait to work in them this fall!"
5.0,"Really like these pants.  While new, I will dress them up a bit. Later I will work outside in them.  38 x 36 fits as it should on me."
4.0,Good small for the size
5.0,"My husband has been wearing these for years, he won't work (farmer) in jeans anymore. They are very comfortable."
5.0,"Might as well call these pants bullet proof. Rugged, durable, and sexy as hell while doing mainly shit around the house. Owned a couple pairs like this that I still wear today,  and those pairs have to be over 10 years old. Those carharts still haven't faded, torn, or shrunk.

Solid purchase and will continue to buy.

Please send me some more ;)"
2.0,"Arrived promtly, but 34x32 size, my usual, was too small in both dimensions. Will probably replace them with ripstop cotton carpenter's pants, if still available, which fit fine when bought several years ago.  Carhartt needs to standardize its sizing!!"
4.0,Length was longer than expecting
5.0,"Great pants. My husband finds these much more comfy than jeans. He likes all the pockets; they're symmetrical pockets, so if he's carrying, say, small heavy tools, the weight can be balanced, and he claims that the pocket (and fabric loop) placement prevents stuff falling out. He wears these with Hold-Ups suspenders."
5.0,good work pants.
5.0,Wow. My legs are big for my waist size. I need pants with a loose fit to be comfortable. These are perfect. I washed them cold and did not notice any shrinkage. Material is strong yet light. I will be buying a couple more pairs. Love 'em.
5.0,Love these pants. Last pair I had lasted me years so had to buy more. Would recommend them to anyone else that I's looking for work pants that breath and last years. Worth the price!
3.0,"when i first opened the package, my first impression was ""they are really thin!"" but i tried them on and it works on slacks. im a size and i have to use the very first hole to tie around my hips. but it looks ok. im keeping them because i get a lot of colors for a good price. its a good way to add detail top an outfit."
5.0,Great pants. Get one size larger.
5.0,Awesome work pants! Most comfortable I've ever used! Never wearing jeans to work again you can feel the weight difference at the end of the day! And my wife says it looks great on me!
3.0,Great pants but sizes run small.
5.0,Nice thick fabric!
5.0,They are awesome all the way around.
4.0,I have been looking for pants that will work for my husband at work. We searched many many hours both online and off. When we got these he was kind of sceptical about them. I washed them of course and there was a little shrinking but nothing like others I have bought that were made out of the same material. They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more. This is a regular family purchase for our family.
5.0,Worth every penny.
5.0,Great quality pants that look and feel wonderful.  Has a pocket on the outer thigh that fits my cased phone perfectly. Shrunk only slightly with the first wash.
5.0,Great fit.
5.0,"High quality, durable work pants. My son works with masonry/stone/brick/block. These withstand a lot of abuse."
3.0,Ordered 3 pair 2 fit as per label the other pair seemed to be a size smaller even though it was labeled the same size
5.0,They may say Men's but I'm a relatively average size woman and they have been perfect for me. Great yard work pants with all sorts of pockets for the tools I need.
5.0,Ordered these for construction and wood working. Very comfortable and they don't hug your legs/thigh such as jeans do when you sweat. If you work outdoors these are perfect for you.
5.0,"Nice Pants
Fit is better (not as baggy as regular fit)"
5.0,The fit is comfortable & fast shipment
5.0,Very comfortable and durable work pants.  Well priced.
4.0,I typically buy these at the farm store and pay more for them. But found them on here and I can save between 5 and 10 dollars on them!
5.0,great!
5.0,These pants can take some serious abuse! After 50 washes they still look and perform well.
5.0,These jeans are truly superior compared to other big names.
5.0,Yep pants that fit
5.0,Great pants were someone long at ankles tight at waist but I ordered a size up on the waist like reviews recommended  and it worked well for us .
5.0,Yes
4.0,Nothing
5.0,"I like them, they are longer than the last pair of Carhartt's I purchased, so that is good as I'm 6'6"" and really need a 37"" inseam which nobody makes.  But all my other 38"" waist pants are a little looser than these.  I'm hoping they will loosen up after a few wears.  They aren't too heavy, they're ok for summer wear."
5.0,"I LOVE these. I recently got a tear that would have ripped my jeans apart, but months later the fear is still tiny, and completely wearable. Love these"
5.0,Great pants. Durable. Still wearing them after a year.
5.0,"very nice fit , very comfortable"
4.0,Standard brand that is built with high quality.
3.0,I expected the canvas material to be more course.
2.0,"I have bought these pants at a retail store, and they fit well.  However, these were too small."
4.0,New favorite work pants
4.0,Very durable and confortable
5.0,"Perfect fit, perfect fabric weight. These are a favorite in the shop. Durable and comfortable. Will purchase more."
5.0,Love these pants. Pockets are in the right spots. Pants fit great
5.0,great light work pants for summer
3.0,"I have owned several pairs of these pants throughout the years. I have often purchased them through local stores as well as Amazon, using the same serial or model number-whatever you want to call it. The material Carhartt has started using is rougher and stiff, probably more durable but the old kind was soft and more comfortable. The fit is still the same which I like, but the texture/rigidity of them is annoying."
5.0,Very nice quality.
5.0,Husband loves these pants.
4.0,These fit the bill for what I was looking for. The size was right on for me.
5.0,Good everyday working pant that is comfortable
5.0,Another win for Carhartt!
5.0,I guess we'll be looking for a suitable replacement. My husband loves these pants and we are very disappointed that Carhartt seems to have discontinued making his size (40 x 36).  He wears them everyday on the farm and they last very well.  They have more give than blue jeans and wear just as well.
5.0,My husband loves them. It is all he will wear to work.
5.0,Great pants to work in
5.0,husband loves these Carhartt pants for work
4.0,Great work/carpenter pants! Found them to be a bit smaller than expected. Especially after the wife washed them and put them in the dryer. Don't need a belt for them now! Probably purchase another pair but one size up to allow for additional craft beer consumption.
5.0,"Just ordered my second pair. Great work pants that are comfortable and loose around the legs, for room to breathe and move around! Sizing was perfect"
4.0,Good
3.0,Ordered the same size as several other Carhartt jeans that I own and for some reason these are snug in every dimension and too long in the leg. Extremely durable just like every other Carhartt product. I have not noticed any color fade. Just wish they had a little more room.
5.0,"Great pants, nice fit good price  will be buying more"
5.0,put on a pair of carharts and your sex appeal doubles!
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish. Use them for work and play. Very high quality and stains come out very easily
5.0,Great fit
5.0,"I recently purchased a pair of the B151 Khaki pants and wanted to try a little different style. These are the Loose fit and they are comfortable and fit just like they should. I have had problems in the past finding the jeans that fit my 30"" inseam. They always seem to be just a little long. These loose fit Carhartt B159's are great. They fit my inseam perfectly when I put on my boots. They don't drag the ground behind my boots. Perfect Fit!"
1.0,Fit too small once finally received.
4.0,Good
5.0,I bought those pants for my boyfriend. He's 1.80 mt and 70 kg. Fit perfect. He will buy another one in other color. The quality it's excellent. Very happy with the purchase.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Honestly, the so-called ""loose fit"", to me, isn't ""loose"". But it does fit, and I'd definitely buy again.  The right side cell pocket holds my Samsung Note 4 in its TPU protective case, leaving about 1/2"" of the phone peeking out the top of the pocket, convenient to reach for when needed, yet secure. The look passes easily for business casual (probably why they're always out of Golden Khaki, and have good sales on 'Mushroom').  And the comfort and strength of the fabric means it'll be around for a while."
5.0,"My husband wears these for work and they hold up really well in comparison to other cheaper options that last only a few months.  They are slightly baggy, but he says they move really well and with his job that is very physically active, movement is a must.  Definitely worth the money."
5.0,"My favorite pair of work pants. Durable and comfortable. I'm 6'3 and these were perfect for me at 34x34, which is rare when you have long legs."
5.0,"Love these pants so far, I mostly wanted the cell phone pocket, hate have my phone in my front or back pocket"
5.0,Definitely pleased with product. Company super efficient
4.0,"Comfortable pants, lot of room to move."
5.0,"I work outside almost everyday in humid Northern Florida. If you work outside, get these pants and never wear jeans again. They are super comfortable have a generous fit. Again, if they can make it down here in the summer they can work anywhere. Stop sweating and upgrade. Great price. I never write reviews but I had to on these pants. Thanks Carrhart"
4.0,I'd say that they run 1.5 inches smaller on the waist and 1 inch short in length.
5.0,I typically wear a 34 length (which is what I ordered) but these are just a little longer than expected. I would order another pair of these in a 33 length and I think they would be good.
2.0,"I love the Carhartt , some haw this particular  doesn't fit will . I looking to purchases more on the deferent brand thanks your costumer JLOPES"
5.0,i love it
3.0,fit seems off
5.0,Nice pants not as heavy as regular Carhart good for summer.
5.0,"Great pants. A bit thinner than the duck pants, perfect during the hotter months."
5.0,
4.0,"Good comfy pants , long days at work I'm hard on clothes  , if I get a year out of it I'm happy , and I get my year?"
5.0,"I hate to admit it but I used to wear skinny jeans. But i have found the light! These jeans are comfortable and can take a beating. Ive taken them hunting, shootingand camping dozens of times. No wearing or tears. Fair warning it looks weird if you ware your carheart jacket the same color."
4.0,"I love Carhartt pants; they're comfortable and mostly long wearing. However I'm disappointed that I can only find my size under the men's sizes. I know Carhartt carries womens jeans but the quality just isn't the same and they don't seem to go any larger than a 38"" hip. I'm willing to pay brand name prices for these because I know they're durable but is it too much to ask to take the mens carpenter pants and add a little bit of ease in the hip? Leave everything else the way it is but just make it easier for women to wear. Either that or make mens and womens sizing the same by putting the waist, hip and inseam in inches in the description instead of a single vague, arbitrary number."
3.0,"Not nreally permanent press, very wrinkled coming out of deyer"
4.0,Fits right. A little long but about right to size. Material seems thin compared to competitors or older carhartt products. A plus is they are nice and light and the phone pocket fits an iphone6
5.0,Very nice
5.0,Awesome pants fit well awesome features with the rip stop fabric!
4.0,Sturdy and actually look real good. Can't go wrong with carthartt products.
5.0,thanks
4.0,Nice fit. I love it
3.0,Fit was to tight in the waste
5.0,Comfortable and look nice
4.0,"love these pants, good work pants or to wear casually. they do fit small so whatever your waist size is go up about 2 sizes."
4.0,"Have several pairs because the pocket design is what I want. Wear a little easy, but maybe I'm a little hard on them."
2.0,"Two stars because I've owned and currently own multiple pairs of Carhartt pants over many years and these run small in the waist. I cannot wear them without undue discomfort therefore are worthless to me. I don't understand why the same company would vary in size? I have heard of this happening with other brands needless to say, a review is a review, just that. Furthermore I own other brands in the same size with no problem for fit and comfort. These are actually waste size 32"" or possibly smaller not 33"" Loose Fit Canvas Carpenter Five Pocket pants. Other than that no complaints, they're pants."
5.0,Great price for a great item
5.0,finer
5.0,Just what I needed. Great pants.
5.0,Great pear of pants for the office or mill
3.0,Not to size ordered. I have other carharts that size and they fit fine these are tight in the waste.
4.0,the inseam seems to be a bit longer than past purchases.
3.0,I need to return them for a larger size
1.0,"These pants fit as expected which is a miracle in itself.  Hard to find 35"" waist.  Will be ordering more in the future."
5.0,"Great work pants!  Thanks! They fit great and do the job!  Excellent customer service, fast shipping too!"
5.0,They are comfortable and hold up well.
5.0,"Bought one pair for my husband who is a landscaper, he loved them! We bought another pair."
3.0,I fit in a size 40 on all other oants however Carhartt pants always run small
5.0,Great work pants for summer time heat. Nice and light!
4.0,GREAT PANTS
5.0,"They fit very well, and are loose enough for larger thighs. The cell phone-sized pocket is a really handy feature, and the wide openings at the bottom to cover boots are nice as well.

The canvas feels durable, and the stitches appear to be strong and well done. I would expect these pants to hold up well over a long period of time and use. I was deciding between these and the Columbia ROC II pants, and have been very happy with these so far."
4.0,Yes fit well and comfortable.
5.0,Great product
4.0,Nice pants will have to see how long they last
5.0,I ordered these for my husband who loves Carhartt brands.  He wears Carhartt daily but needs something lighter during the summer months.  I have been looking for something other than the standard colors and these were perfect plus he loves the lose fit and carpenter style.
5.0,Happy with the fit and look!!
3.0,"Love Carhartt products for my husband, but these pants weren't what we expected. They were too tight in the waist, not loose fit at all. I returned them for a different Carhartt style pants. Got my fingers crossed they'll fit my husband the way he wants them to."
5.0,great pants! fit amazingly very comfortable and durable!
5.0,"These pants fit like they should. They are durable enough, but not if you're working on your knees a lot. I like the khakis because they look sort of dressed up for those times the CEO comes to town. The right side leg pocket is large enough to hold my iPhone 6 with a metal Verus case securely."
5.0,"Love them durable, comfortable.. I guess sizes run alittle big though.

Will defiantly buy again"
5.0,"If you want good work pants, buy carharrt."
5.0,Just as described
5.0,Excellent fit and regular Carhart quality
5.0,"Couldn't find the ""loose"" fit in the store. Fit perfect."
4.0,"Amazing fit and look. Very comfortable.  Only drawback is they are easily wrinkled. Solution is to add extra water to them after wash,  smooth out wrinkles,  fold,  then throw them in the dryer facing their tumbling direction. It's an annoying process,  but they are easily my favorite pants."
4.0,great
3.0,"Material is good. I always wear a 31x34 Levi 505, which is what I ordered. They were way too long. I tried washing them since they're 100% cotton and they did shrink length-wise, but are still a good 2"" longer than my Levi's. They are also definitely baggy."
3.0,"We're picky about work clothing and have been using Carhartt for years.
Why do these not fit true to size? They are a little small in the waist, necessitating an unbuttoned top button for comfort.
The next larger size would probably be too large.
Not sure if this is a fluke. But don't have time to go through the exchange routine.
*sigh*"
5.0,Love these pants for work. I'm and engineer in a manufacturing company. These pants are comfortable and a little more dress-y than jeans. That's why I have 4 pair!!!
5.0,"Very comfortable and fit well. Durable material should hold up to daily work wear. I did have to order a 30 length when I normally wear a 32 in every other pant Ive bought. Ive found Carhart's sizing to be a llittle difficult at times, I tried them at my local Carhart store before ordering."
5.0,Perfect
3.0,It's a little tighter than I expected.  I wear 36x36 of Carhartt's Loose Fit jeans and that fits perfectly.  These 36x36 Loose Fit Carpenter pants are a little too tight.  I'm not going to return it.  I'm planning on getting skinnier anyways.  So at least I'll have something to wear then.
3.0,"I think the pair that I received
are irregular because the outer
right leg seem crosses over my
right shin. I therefore have to use
those pants strictly to mess them
up! I also paid full price for that
defect. The ones pictured on the
Model look perfect."
1.0,"Too small. Did not fit. In fact, I sent it back."
5.0,These are the best work pants ever.
5.0,would use again
3.0,Definitely order a size or even two sizes up
5.0,Carhartt makes the best work pants. Period
5.0,Good pants. Just make sure to go up one size on the waist. For some reason the canvas carhartts always run small in the waist
2.0,The pants that I was wearing for work all day was 44 X 30.  When got home tried these on.  Could not even get the button close enough on the waist to fasten.  The length of the pant leg almost covered my foot.  Pants were marked 44 X 30!  And do not know how ended up with these.  Was looking for the cargo pants.  The pants did seem to fit in thighs and hips but can not say for sure as was not able to get buttoned to bend and squat.  Needed for my work.  Was first pair of Carhartt pants I had tried.
2.0,Nice plants but they run small and shrink incredibly.
5.0,Carhardt is always high quality
2.0,I have a handful of Carhartt pants in several different styles. I have two pairs in this style. All of them fit consistently.  I tried to replace my worn out charcoal loose fit 5 pocket canvas carpenter jeans and received a pair that was far too small through the waist.  I returned them and ordered a replacement and got another pair that was far too small. What do I do? Is it just this style that has shifted sizes? is it just this color? This is a huge pain in the butt.  I need to replace my favorite worn out pants and this too much work.
3.0,"These run small.  I typically wear 32"" jeans with a belt and found the 32"" waste to be too small.  They taper up towards the waste quite a bit which makes them run small."
5.0,This was a gift
4.0,Nice pants. If your into that sort of thing.
2.0,"The material, quality, and construction is all great, however I've had to buy three different pairs all the same size to get one that fit right.  I wear a 34x30 and first pair the waist was waaay to tight, second pair waste was perfect, length was too short, and third pair fits just right.  Love them when I find ones that fit, but easier to buy them in store so you can try on  multiple pairs"
4.0,"I didn't realize how loose ""loose"" meant. Waist and hips fit good but the legs don't taper even a little. They feel too roomy, like having your legs in paper bags. If they have them in a straight leg I'd prefer that. Quality is top notch though. If you can confirm these haven't been dyed in anything containing formaldehyde or any other known toxins I'd give them a 5."
3.0,Nice pants but size runs smaller than Carhartt jeans.  I ordered Carhartt jeans along with these and the jeans fit fine but these are too small.
1.0,Too small in the waist. Order one size bigger
5.0,I wear these pants at work because they are comfortable and fit me better than the uniform pants that we are issued.
5.0,These are the ideal pants.
1.0,Sizing is a mess with Carhartt pants. Both waist and length are off and can be either too large or too small. After trying three different pairs I gave up.
4.0,"Great fit, great wear, and great for work and play."
5.0,I'll never go back to denim. These are much more durable than any blue jeans. It was awkward getting used to how they sit kind of low on the hips but they're the perfect work pants for me now.
4.0,"I got the 32 Waist x 34 Length.  I'm 5' 11"" 170 lbs and it fits me great but the ideal size probably would have been 33 waist just for alittle breathing room.  Look great too, love the gray color."
1.0,"it is the same model number as the pair I own, but the material is thinner and the waist size is smaller.  They should be identical,"
5.0,Great pants. Fits perfectly.
5.0,It's the only pants I will buy and haven't purchased any other brands in the last 10 years!
5.0,"Great pants, but run small."
2.0,2 pairs of pants same size one fits good the other to small
5.0,Excellent pair of pants
5.0,great
5.0,"Perfect fit from the start. I like the subtle design of the cargo pockets that are a bit more to the rear of the leg and less obvious as other cargo pocket pant designs which gives the pants a sleeker and dressier look. The material feels rugged without being overly stiff -- a good compromise. Nice moss color, too."
5.0,Great product as expected. Great product as expected.
3.0,"I bought these pants to wear something not like regular casual ""khaki"" pants, but also similar to jeans but not blue. I chose the charcoal color. The material seems sturdy, but as expected, the pockets are not deep and spacious. Trying to get something out of the front pockets feels awkward. The so-called cellular phone pocket is large enough to stick a phone encased in an Otter Box, but I would prefer not to carry it in a leg pocket without a button or zipper. It doesn't completely conceal the phone."
5.0,Good fit
4.0,Too long
5.0,"what you would expect from carhart. comfortable, breathes good, looks good"
3.0,"I ordered 32x32, which is the size for all my other pants including one from carhart I bought at the same time. It fit more like a 30x32; the waist was too tight and the length was appropriate. I have exchanged for 33x32 and will see how it fits. The material feels good, and I anticipate these lasting me for a while on work sites."
1.0,Size is not the same get two size bigger
5.0,"Perfect fit, nice and comfortable. Great cell phone pocket to boot (iPhone 6s) fits a little loose which I like."
3.0,I had to take the jeans to a tailor  to be fitted correctly.
4.0,Nice quality!
4.0,"I've been wearing Carhartt Carpenter pants for years, and have always been happy with the fit and durability."
5.0,As advertised
2.0,"Not too pleased with product I use them for work and they seem to attract dirt and anything else you make work with such as insulation dust,etc.not easily dusted off like denim they also wrinkle very easily and make them less attractive,I like the fit and comfort,if possibly made from different fabric like denim or similar would be perfect."
4.0,"My hope is that with the Canvas rather than the twill these will last a little longer.  Have the twill pant and while very comfortable were not as durable.  These should be a good addition to my work wardrobe for winter when a heavier pant is needed.  will still wear the twill in the Summer, as these may cause some unnessesary uncomfortablity with the weight of the fabric"
5.0,5*!
4.0,I am always satisfied with my orders
5.0,This was tough they almost fit as expected but they are a bit loose at the waist. The quality is excellent as expected from Carhartt.
4.0,Great pants
4.0,Great looking pants but was bigger than I thought.
5.0,Very easy care and durable lite comfortable
5.0,Great fit !!
5.0,My huhusband loves them the only problem is they are a tab bit longer than most pants that are 32 in length
5.0,MY HUSBAND LOVES THE PANTS. THEY ARE JUST WHAT HE NEEDED. HE WORKS OUTSIDE SO HE LOVES CARHARTTS
3.0,they are a little short for being sold as 36x34.
3.0,SO far so good. I have washed them now like 4 to 5 times and they have a smell to them. Maybe it's just me. I'm going to try the Dickies because they cost 10 to 12 less. Lower the price on these and I will buy more.
5.0,My husband loves these jeans.  He is very rugged on his clothes and these seem to be the only ones that hold up well.
5.0,Love em. Perfect in the Arizona heat.
4.0,"Well constructed, good material, nice loose fit through the legs and rear. Only wish they were flared more for boots."
4.0,Good pants
4.0,I love Carhartts. They are the only pants I buy for work but these are not my favorite. The waist is a much tighter fit and the legs are really baggy. I look like MC Hammer in them. I bought 3 pairs in one color and two pairs in another color and they all fit the same. At least they are consistent I guess. Other than that they are of good quality material and made well.
5.0,super nice and very comfortable and they fit well great work pants and casual pants.
5.0,Great work pants.
5.0,Must order a size up. They run a little small
5.0,great
5.0,"Fit just a tad bit snug compared to most 36x32s but still fits well enough. Definitely recommend, great pants, great quality, fast shipping"
4.0,Fit as expected. He really likes them!
5.0,Love these pants!
5.0,"My husband was very pleased with these pants, he is 6'0 and weighs about 190 - so a 36/30 fit him great! Carhartt has great products and these pants did not disappoint."
5.0,Just what I've come to expect from carhartt. Little bit more slim in the legs but still good to go!
5.0,"Carhartt makes the best pants for working that I've ever found. I use these for yard work, as well as any moving/lifting/etc that tears up nice jeans. My first pair of these lasted about 6 years and are finally wearing through, and I'm betting these will last even longer. Great pants!"
5.0,"These are the best work pants ever.  My boys, age ranges teen to twenty-something to hubby, wear these for work and camping.  The material is sturdy and washes very well.  I do not use dryer sheets, as they can damage clothing.  These pants last forever and take a beating!  Hubby does alot of work on his knees, so after several months, the knees do wear out and rip, so it's patch time and they last and last and last.  They offer great protection when hiking through brush or working in the woodshop or with tools.  I highly recommend this brand.  The fit is really comfy too - who wants tight work pants that you can't bend in?  They're not baggy even tho they're loose fit.  They're just right!  You won't be sorry."
2.0,At first the pants were great. They fit perfectly and were comfortable. Now almost 6 months later they have shrunk to the point that I cannot wear them anymore. I'm really bummed because I was hoping they'd last for a few years.
2.0,Too baggy and too long in size 42 waist 32 long. I have returned them. Could not find same item in a more traditional fit.
5.0,Pants arrived in good packaging. Fit well according to chart. Look good feel good nice and loose easy to work in.
3.0,Dickies fit better. No more Carhart for me
3.0,"I normally wear a 36 size waist and they said it ran a bit small so ordered a pair of 38 thinking it would give me a bit of room, they were kinda tight and they fit snug"
5.0,To small
4.0,"Only getting a 4 star rating due to the waist fitting a little tight. The length was fine though. I typically wear a 34"" waist in jeans, but the reviews said it fit somewhat small so I bought it in a 35"" waist to be safe, but it is just a little too snug. Next time I'll buy a 36"" waist. Other than that I have no complaints, feels and looks great everywhere else."
4.0,lovely
4.0,"They are just a little tight in the waist.  Overall, love the material and color."
5.0,Waist is slightly smaller then expected but still a good fit. Length is good with enough room for my work boots. Still very high quality pants.
2.0,said 34waist but more like 33 for sure
5.0,I love it.
5.0,Love these pants!
2.0,These run small.  May husband wears a 38x36 and he couldn't even button these.
5.0,Most comfortable.surprisingly more so than dungarees
5.0,Not as stiff as other pants from Carhartt. Great color!
4.0,I like these jeans a lot. I own 4 pair now. I wish I could find this style in a little less canvas feeling material. That is the only thing I would change.
5.0,Good bye
5.0,Excellent pants at a great price.  Fits perfectly and held up well after washing and drying.
4.0,this brand always runs small
4.0,They fit fine for me and meet the needs of the work I do.
5.0,Perfect fit. Very comfortable.
1.0,Small at waist and huge everywhere else. B151 fit alot better
3.0,product quality was good...but the waist was too small for me.
5.0,Great work pants
5.0,I like the loose fit better than the relaxed fit. Waist size was perfect. I don't see how so many people mention in they're reviews to buy larger waist size. I recommend you buy your normal pants size.
4.0,purchased as a gift and he said all was good.
4.0,Very nice fit and comfortability for work pants.
5.0,Great!
4.0,Little more baggy than I expected but other than that they are very comfortable.
2.0,"I've had other carhartt pants usually a size 32. Those fit pretty good but we're starting to feel a little tight after washing. So I ordered these in a 33 and before washing them they are tighter than my 32s?!? Worst part is, because I already ripped off the tags assuming they would fit fine like my other ones I can't return them..."
5.0,Fit as expected!
5.0,"Great fit and durable fabric.
 I love the cell phone pocket."
5.0,Nice pants  just what we expected
5.0,Great work and casual pants.  My only thought is that the gray color can fade somewhat quickly if you work on your knees a lot as I do.
5.0,LOVE these pants!!!
5.0,Please.
5.0,Fit well
1.0,"Tried twice. Started with my size of 32/32, way too small in the waist, got a 34/32. Still too small. 36 would have been too big... I give up."
1.0,"These are not the old Canvas pants Carhartt used to make!!
I've been wearing Carhartt canvas pants about 20-years. These pants are not the same by a long shot. The pants have a very thin material and the thread in the seams was a different color than the pant! That made it look like I was wearing stripe's and the pockets highlighted. ""Totally Ridiculous""

Sadly my old canvas pants are seeing the end of their days, and now I think Carhartt has too, for me anyway. Low quality & higher prices have ruined an age-old name. Immediately returned them for a refund...
.
I do not recommend buying these pants!!"
5.0,Great
3.0,These are too small.  How I send them back and get a bigger pair??
5.0,Was excited to get a hard to find size and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Good fit
4.0,Run a little large but for work so he is fine with them.
4.0,Just as i was hoping. Fits just right
1.0,Very unhappy with the purchase
5.0,Good
5.0,Great item
5.0,I had a pair prior to this pair and literally worn them until I had holes in the knees.  The fit is exactly what I had expected.  Also a very durable paint.
5.0,"Everything carhartt is so nice. It's always the best quality and durability. Super nice pants, i perfer this material over dikies or jeans anyday. and they look good. True to size, not large or small, don't assume because its Carhartt it will be big. Totally worth 40$."
5.0,love them
5.0,"comfortable, tough and help keep the cold out. I love them. I wear them pretty much everyday to work as a construction manager."
5.0,Great fit
4.0,"Great pants, slightly loser fit and thinner material than traditional Carhartt pants.  Very nice for more casual wear."
5.0,"Great. Wearing them right now. Comfortable and solid. Wore them to work in as a teacher, but they will start being used for work outdoor pants. I might even like them more than my Riggs pants, which I really like."
3.0,I had ordered the exact size that my son-in-law already had but these were too small and I had to return for the next larger size. The new pants were fine but wish the sizing was more consistent.
5.0,"Exactly what my husband wanted, but cheaper than in the store. Great pants. He wears them everyday to work(as a carpenter)"
5.0,Love these!
5.0,I love these pants. They fit a iPhone perfect and look good too.
5.0,very good quality. Ill be able to really beat these up
5.0,"Awesome pants... Recommended, and will buy again."
5.0,Great
3.0,ok
5.0,Great pants! Comfortable and lightweight but durable!
5.0,Nice
5.0,These are my favorite work pants! Light weight and very durable
3.0,"Pants run smaller in the waist, just go up a size. Comfortable to work in. My only issue with these are after the dryer they need to be ironed every time, these wrinkle like crazy."
5.0,Good quality and plenty of extra pockets.
1.0,Ordered a 34X30.  They ended up being 30X34.  The legs are HUGE and you can fit both your legs in one of the pant legs.
5.0,Perfect work pants. They even have a cell phone pocket on the leg. Awesome.
5.0,great pants!
5.0,Margaret..  need I say more?
3.0,"not true to size, did not fit."
5.0,"Carhart is always a great purchase.  Delivery by UPS was not great, but with no other options offered you're stuck."
4.0,Pretty good. The only problem is that this is not really a jeans. It really wrinkles quickly and requires ironing daily
4.0,"The blue is... very uniform style. I feel like a policeman or nurse whenever I wear these. They are starting to fade a bit now, but same good quality and build."
3.0,Love these pants but sizing was way off. Waist was way too tight and inseam was way too long.
5.0,Husband's favorite work pants
5.0,Product runs longer
3.0,"Nice pants just a little baggy, when I put these on my wife says ""what up gangsta"" to me lol I love them just wish they fit better also I bought a 42""30"
5.0,Fit great
5.0,Looks good
5.0,great pants
5.0,Great work pants
2.0,"Rough and fabric is too crisp, for a lack of better words. Not comfortable at all. Have washed and worn several times, going to donate to goodwill."
1.0,Totally mis-sized.  Love brand but who is in charge of sizing?  Tired of having to return 75% of Carhartt orders.
5.0,well made
5.0,Live in these. All winter.
5.0,Great product and fast shipping.
5.0,"I ordered the size that I normally wear as far as jeans go, 35/34.  I'm 6-1, 210 labs and they fit great.  I've worn the s&*t out of these things already and have not been disappointed yet.  The pockets are deep enough to fit my hands up to the wrists and the back pockets fit my wallet well.  The thigh pockets are just the right size to fit my cell phone (iPhone 5) with a slightly bulky case on it.  The pants feel good and look pretty good too.  I have gotten all kinds of crap on them and they seem to wash well.  Dried joint compound came right off with my fingernail and the residue washed right out.  They don't wrinkle too bad and I haven't had any shrinkage from the wash yet.  The bottoms fit right over all the boots and shoes that I've worn with them without any bunching at the hems, but the cuffs aren't so big that they drag on the ground behind the shoe either.  I will definitely purchase one or two more pairs if these start to fall apart, but I don't have a feeling that they will anytime soon."
4.0,"I ordered my normal size, and it ran small. Still a great product"
5.0,Best work pants ever. I use them all year round.
3.0,"These pants run small, period,"
4.0,"Very comfortable and well made. Like the heavy material, deep pockets, and the xtra pockets."
5.0,Great pants all around.  No complaints.
5.0,Very nice fit. 34x36 fit me well. I'm 6'4 208 lbs. Comfortable pants. Not super heavy duty however. Just right for regular work pants.
5.0,Would be looser fit if I lost a few pounds. Lol
5.0,"I own three pairs of these pants and have been wearing them for years instead of regular Levis. They're rugged, attractive and fit great. I couldn't be happier."
5.0,good quality
5.0,"I tried them on, and they fit good....."
4.0,"""Slightly, on the small side."""
5.0,Everything was perfect and delivery was earlier than expected at time of order.
5.0,"I, a woman, love the fit of these jeans!  The lower rise is much more comfortable, and all the pockets are very handy.  This is my 2nd pair of these -- the 1st pair had just the right amount of Loose Fit (loose, but not baggy), so had to get another."
5.0,Excellent fit!
4.0,love 'em.
4.0,"Great Pant except the length is suppose to be 32 and they puddle at the floor.  :( not happy about that, now I have to get them altered."
5.0,Had to exchange my 38x36 back for fitting somewhat small.. I was sent 40x34  which fit very nicely
4.0,"Great pants, but I either put on a few or the waist is just a tad smaller than expected.  I'd recommend ordering one size larger in the waist for good measure."
5.0,Great
5.0,"Love these pants for work. Bought 4 pairs, have lasted 3 months so far."
5.0,great
4.0,"These were a little long.  I used the tag on a pair I had and bought these online - using these measurements.  They came in about 1"" too long."
5.0,Good
4.0,"Good fit, bit on a thinner side - material, compared to the other Carhart pants I have. Actually going to order couple of these right now."
4.0,"I love the fit, comfortable, and enough pocket space for my type of work."
5.0,Look great and fits perfectly. Very comfortable and practical pair of pants. I would probably buy a light color next time though since mine seem to attract white lint.
5.0,Nice pants. Wear well and fit nice.
5.0,My husband loves these pants.  He says they are like a thin cotton duck.  He got two pairs one in navy and the other in mushroom.  They look great too.
2.0,Very tight waist. Didn't fit into what I typically fit into - runs very small.
5.0,Work pants for my husband look good and sturdy
2.0,"This item fits very nicely around the waist. However, the length was supposed to be 30"" and is much longer than stated. Somewhat disappointing as we do not have time to send them back."
5.0,Excellent.
5.0,Ran a little small but other then that they are perfect!
5.0,Great pants
5.0,love it
5.0,"I ordered these 4 1/2 years ago and, sadly, today I had to lay them to rest. Shift work in the paper mill was a hard life, and now they're done. Good thing I ordered 6 more pair to share the load."
5.0,Perfect fit. Very nice quality
5.0,Good Quality and lightweight. Comfortable
5.0,it is hard for a fat man like me to find good quality pants that fit and these fit great so thank you !!
5.0,"Fairly lightweight pair of pants, meaning light in weight not quality, good for warmer weather.  Side pocket will fit an Apple Iphone 6 plus smartphone, but a little tight."
5.0,Fit great. Like'm.
5.0,These pants are great. My husband works in construction are very durable.
5.0,I tend to need a slightly more generous cut in the legs than most pants that fit my waist would give. The loose fit Carpenter pants fit very well. I'm only wearing them to work around the house so they are plenty durable for my needs.
5.0,"Carhartt makes some great pants, but for me their fit is really tricky. Some of their pants ride up too high on the waist. Some are too tight if you have big thighs like me. These B159 loose fit seem to be the best fitting of all for me. I like the material of these pants - they are canvas, but feel more like smooth denim. And best of all, they are classy enough to wear to work, yet durable enough to wear while doing yard clean up.

One tip - always order one inseam size longer than you normally would, because with all Carhatt products, they shrink a lot after repeated washing & drying!!"
4.0,"Nicely made pants that fit true to size. For someone in construction, frequently crawling around doing hard labor, they hold up fairly well. I have had to use some patches on the knees occasionally, but all in all Carhartt offers some good  quality products."
4.0,"The description states:  Loose Fit - and that is what these pants are.  They fit perfectly as expected.  Lots of room to work in them and be comfortable.  This is my 2nd pair.  For work, I love these - feels like the loose coveralls without the bib and the suspenders."
5.0,The pants were just the right fit.
4.0,"My husband really likes pants, but he is a huge Carhartt fan.  The only complaint that I have is that the color fades faster than I would appreciate.  Otherwise, these are an excellent work pant."
3.0,"I am a fairly skinny guy, and very tall as well so it is hard for me to find pants. The pants fit fairly well around the waist, but I just felt like they were too baggy in the leg. I know that they are loose fit, but to me they just felt too loose. I loved the material feel and the 5th pocket is great for carrying around a multitool or just for extra pocket space."
5.0,Fits perfect and excellent quality
5.0,"Since I started wearing these I don't ever see myself going back to jeans. I have 4 different pairs of these plus 2 in the older style and fabric. The pants are tough and stand up well, very practical to wear, and the pockets are great for my every day carry items."
5.0,Great work pants
5.0,Got these for my son to ride trails on his dirt bike. He loved them said they wore great for his rugged trip.
5.0,Soft and broken in feeling out of the package.  Lightweight pants good for warmer weather working.
5.0,Only pants my husband will wear to work!!
5.0,"Great fit, they seem pretty similar to the canvas work pant.  The legs are pretty roomy but they're still ""stylish"" enough to wear to work or around town.

This material is almost identical to the canvas work pant and is substantially thinner/lighter than the washed duck, although still quite durable."
5.0,It's a good quality pair of pants
4.0,"I love Carharrt's quality, but for some reason each color pant fits differently even though they are the same model.

UPDATE: I contacted Carhartt about the sporadic size differences for the same model (but different color). The representative was very friendly and helpful. They offed to inspect the pants and if there is an issue they will replace with new. If you want to send them back to corporate make sure you have all the details. Size, Model, Color that you will be sending back to them.

From experience the darker the color the tighter the fit. I don't know why this is."
5.0,great pants just too long. Needed shorter in legs
5.0,Got these for my husband; I will be replacing all his jeans with these. Said they are better than any of his pants!
5.0,Excellent fit!
4.0,Very comfortable.  Like the cell phone pocket
5.0,These pants are the best ones that I've owned for my landscaping job. They offer the proper protection and they damn near fit perfectly. Recommend.
5.0,Legs are way baggy but waist fits as expected
1.0,Too thin.
5.0,Fit great and are comfortable
4.0,"Fit is true to size, Carhartt always has quality products."
5.0,Great fit and color as shown.
5.0,My hubby loves them and they fit perfectly!
4.0,"Only qualm is I couldn't find my size (32x34) so went a size up on the waist, still fits decent though, and it's a nice weight fabric."
4.0,"The fit is great and exactly as expected.  I just wish that they sold other pants with the ""loose fit"" style."
5.0,"I work in an office, but we occasionally move heavy equipment around and visit industrial spaces. I like Carhartt since they are rugged yet look more ""professional"" than jeans. Ordered one pair in 38x34 which fit perfectly. Ordered three more in different colors, and all were a great fit."
5.0,Fantastic pants. They fit great and they're rugged for construction site work. Awesome.
5.0,Excellent
2.0,does not fit as expected
5.0,"Carhartt pants are great, sturdy and comfortable."
4.0,Runs long
5.0,Great pants!
5.0,Best pants ever! Too bad this model was discontinued by Carhartt.
2.0,Tight around the thigh
5.0,"Great fit, delivered on time."
5.0,Good pants for carpenter
5.0,Fit great. They have been durable thus far. As expected from a quality name
1.0,It makes no sense at all. I have always used and still buy 32x34. Tried the pants iy barely fits me. Really disappointed.
4.0,"Seems like people tend to think these pants run smallish ... they seemed fairly normal to me.  And the Amazon return policy is so easy, if you do need to exchange them, it's no problem.  The waist is a little higher than I expected; nothing too dramatic, just a little different.  Nice casual pants."
5.0,Great pair of work pants. Has few key pockets for a few tools and a hammer holster. Great overall but run alittle smaller.
4.0,"A miss-order that I'm super happy with! Thought I was ordering the denim version, and am much happier with these. Better style and just dressy enough. Would be five stars if they made the double knee in these pants."
5.0,"Very happy, great fit"
5.0,Great
4.0,I can't give a proper review as i couldn't even get the pants over my bum.  However. I will give a 4 star rating because i know Carhartt makes quality clothing.
5.0,Son liked the fit. I will reserve opinion depending on the way they wear.
5.0,good quality product. reasonable price.
5.0,Good comfortable pants.
4.0,Fits as it should. Light yet sturdy pants. Have several pairs. Great for work as they are not too hot and heavy.
4.0,"I really like these pants.  My only issue: in the past carhartt pants have had issues shrinking lengthwise, I usually ordered a 36"" inseam and expected them to shrink down to 34"".  I did that with these pants and they did not shrink at all in the inseam so they are a bit long.  Other than that these are great pants.  Comfortable and durable."
4.0,"I've been wearing  this model (159) of carhartt for several years. Like the fit, like the pockets."
5.0,Very pleased
5.0,Fit right and seem like they'll be good work pants.
5.0,Good quality as always.
5.0,Durable work pants
5.0,Love them
5.0,My husband loves these
5.0,"good stuff. us made or chinee made don't matter none.

it still good stuff. and i have sears with a lousy selection......so hoorah to amazon!"
1.0,The size was supposed to be 31x32 but was 33x32
4.0,Love these jeans. After a few washes they are the softest and easily the most comfortable I've ever worn. But they aren't the strongest. They tend to rip out on the front thighs after several months. These are the only jeans I have that do that.
4.0,great pants
5.0,"Being a customer for many years, you know what to expect from Carhartt, and you get it!"
5.0,excellent as usual for carhartt
5.0,"Quick shipping, good price, happy customer."
1.0,Run Way too amall
5.0,"Great looking, durable work pants for my millwright man!"
4.0,"Love the look and love the product, but they are just a bit smaller than I expected."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised. These pants are so nice that they could be worn into a managerial meeting and then walk outside and frame some walls. I really like them.
4.0,Just what I was looking for
5.0,"Fit is great, material is a medium weight, so it is durable for Spring and Fall weather."
5.0,"These are great summer work pants. I have two pairs of 38 waist but the longer I wash them, they get slightly smaller.  So ordered a size 40, I need a belt but really like the extra room.  I would recommend ordering one size larger than you usually wear."
5.0,Love these pants...so comfortable.
4.0,Very happy product
5.0,40 waist was a bit tight. Could be my fault. :0
5.0,Great pants
4.0,"Good pants, size large"
4.0,A little small for the size 34 waist
5.0,"Excellent, love these pants!"
5.0,"Great pair or pants, comfortable and good looking pants, I like the pockets."
5.0,Love them
5.0,Pants fit perfect. Durable and comfortable.
4.0,Good
5.0,Husband loves them!
5.0,Very comfortable and well made.
5.0,My son loves these!
5.0,This was a good choice.
3.0,"Bought these pants for work. I wear a 33x32 for most everything. These pants are way big in the legs, the waist is too big and they're too long. I thought they would shrink up a bit but they didn't. If I had to buy these again I'd go with a smaller size because these ended up being too baggy on me. They've been in fairly consistent use and are now starting to wear out after about a year. Overall, they're good pants but I would definitely order the next size down. Others have said they run big or run small so go try them on in a store before purchasing. Carhartt stuff seems to have a lot variation in it's sizing."
5.0,No
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants. I work with 20 to 40 dog's regularly and these pants hold up to everything. That includes muddy paws and catching nails. They are extremely comfortable while kneeling or squatting too. If I had the money, I would buy 3 of each color."
2.0,Hard to buy certain items and brands online. These pants would qualify.
5.0,great fit very durable
5.0,"These are great work pants!! And so  convenient To order online but, I tried a pair on before I ordered more. Very happy with them!"
3.0,prefer relaxed fit
5.0,Works great for my note 4.
5.0,Fit my brother well
5.0,"Fit well, feel better"
5.0,"Fit perctly my husband who is 6'1"" and 230 lbs.  These pants have a nice loose fit on the legs.  Nice enough to go out too."
5.0,Excellent quality
5.0,"I have a hard time finding pants that fit. Often they are way to tight through the thighs so I have to go up in the waist to get pants that fit. These had plenty of room for my big legs to fit!  And they are good looking too!  I'm 6'4"" 280#s"
5.0,These pants are durable and fit great.  They last a long time and are very well made.
2.0,"I have purchased other Carharrt products that were exceptionally well made and study.  These pants fall short.  The material is not wearing very well and the zipper has a bad tooth after only wearing them once.  I do like the pocket for the phone.  My 6+ fits great.
Dissappointing."
5.0,Great fit...Good quality...Ordering one more pair...
5.0,My boyfriend loves these. I'm going to order him more!
3.0,"its ok, i like it"
5.0,"Excellent fit, quality material, fast shipping.  Will get again."
5.0,Fit perfect
5.0,Couldn't ask for a better pair of working jeans !!!!!!
5.0,As promised no problems
3.0,The loose fit is a little baggy on me. I would prefer a casual fit
4.0,"Love em, but after 2 months there's already holes in the knees. Super comfortable though."
5.0,Great deal. Arrived in 2 days free shipping. Fit perfect
5.0,Best looking most comfortable casual / work pants I have ever owned.  They are light and keep cool on hot days.  I plan to add several to my closet.  Great product.
5.0,Great pants fit as expected!
5.0,Great
5.0,They were a little tight in the waist
5.0,"I've ordered additional pairs of these.  You can get them here with a 35"" waist - no where else for selection and value received!  And they're Carhartt's so they're rugged and last a long time."
5.0,The fit was perfect. A lot of pants these days seem to be designed for skinny dudes with scrawny thighs and no butt. The loose fit of these pants makes them among the most comfortable pants I have ever worn.
5.0,"Was looking for work pants lighter, cooler than denim, they are a bit reminiscent of bell bottoms, but much better fit than other Carhart pants I have bought."
5.0,Great purchase....can never go wrong with the Carhartt brand!!
5.0,Comfortable.
5.0,"The quality is good, the price is right"
5.0,I bought these pants for my son and he thinks they're great.
5.0,Fit Fine after one washing. Pleased!
3.0,To bagy
5.0,Great fit as expected
5.0,Great pair of pants
5.0,"great work pants, mid weight for warm weather, good fit, a little thicker than the b151, so they should last a little longer."
2.0,"I bought two pairs of these because I know my exact size which is usually enough to buy without needing to try the pants on.

The first pair I got, Mushroom, were much longer than the listed inseam, I'm stepping on them every step, so either I return or pay for the them to be tailored.

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?  It costs me a lot to have these tailored and they aren't worth it but I need pants and I already lost enough time on this."
5.0,Love these pants for work. Pockets are great for tools. The fabric is rugged enough for work but light enough to be comfortable and cool in temperature.
5.0,Very lite material. Perfect for warmer days. Not the heavy canvasy ( if that's a word ) carhartt material. Run a bit small
5.0,Like the fit good quality.
5.0,"Was actually looking for a slightly different style, similar weight, in an indigo. Beginning to think they don't make that style anymore. These feel terrific."
5.0,Great purchase
5.0,A good summer work pant.
2.0,"I bought this pant, but I recieved it with six pocket and the legs were too big, like a rapper, I don't like this item."
4.0,I like it!
5.0,comfy and fit well.
5.0,great
1.0,To tight
4.0,that u so much for helping me get it right
4.0,Nice pants. A little long for 32 inseam.
4.0,was a little long even though I ordered my usual size. Good quality though as usual from Carhartt !
4.0,Item as described good value nice quality fits well would buy again
5.0,Love these pants for work light for warm days and very comfortable
5.0,To start off I first bought a couple pairs of these for work and they lasted me a couple years which is what I expected. I must say I really am happy with these pants. These fit perfect and exactly how I was expecting them to. only reason I need to buy new ones is because after having them for a year or two a hole started tearing in the crotch.
4.0,"Very good quality. I expected them to shrink a bit in the wash because of the material, but they did not shrink at all. I'll order proper size next time."
1.0,Logo on  shirt has partially worn off after just a few washes.
5.0,Great pants.  True to size listed.
5.0,Nice work pants
5.0,"Excellent pants. I've worked in Levis for 30 years...and I have to say these Carhartts are much more comfortable to work in. The Levis are now saved for weekends, like the rest of the white-collar world :)"
5.0,"Carhartt never lets me down! Great fit, very durable, and not too hot on long days landscaping in the sun."
5.0,"Pats fit great... Have been buying several Carharts pants, however this particular one has been showing a couple of holes on the top leg... maybe the material had a defect...?"
3.0,"3"" too long"
5.0,Fit great!
3.0,"I purhased a size 30 inseam, but they seem much longer. I roll them up."
5.0,Nice paint for the price fast shipping
5.0,Perfect weight for the summer
5.0,They are Carhartts so you get what you expect. Great deal. Came promptly. Good job.
4.0,Good quality
5.0,They were a birthday gift for my son. Carhartt never disappoints.
3.0,"The rise of these pants is incredibly high. Walking was uncomfortable because I couldn't take full steps which made me look like I'd just messed myself. Additionally I need to be able to straddle roof ridges for wok and without hiking these up over my belly button there was no way to accomplish that.

Love the material and Carhartt has such great customer service I hate to complain but if they could cut these like the #101118 jeans that'd be awesome & I'd buy 4-5 pairs and wear them to work every day. So far I've found this to be a problem with Carhartt's products designed for work. Very tight in the pocketed area and very high cut. Different material but basically cut like mom jeans."
2.0,They are OK. Kinda flimsy construction. I've had them for about 6 months and they are already pretty worn. The right thigh pocket re-inforcement gets all bunched up and annoys the crap out of me. I do like the way they fit and the overall design. These are not even close to a pair or arborwear pants or a pair of heavier duty Carhartts though.
5.0,"Fits good, fast delivery"
4.0,Great quality
5.0,Husband only wears these- I buy 6 pairs every summer.
5.0,Great
5.0,Great pant perfect for work
4.0,They sit a little higher than I would like but they are nice pants. I docked them one star for saying they sit a little lower when they still sit fairly high.
4.0,"I needed one size larger, but overall satisfied"
5.0,"My husband loves these pants, so we bought three pair.  He wears them for work as an electrician."
5.0,Very nice. Beautiful product. Fits perfectly. They on appearance look like khaki's but with work horse materials and longevity. Will buy again for my husband.
5.0,"I own 2 pairs of these already, they are my go to pant once the weather starts to warm up and I can shed the coverall.  Awesome hot weather work pant."
5.0,"very comfortable fit and wear as expected, return customer."
5.0,"I love these like all my Carhartts.  I'm glad I listened to other reviewers.  I normally wear a 32/32 or 33/32.  I ordered these in 34/32 and they fit PERFECTLY.  I love the fit, perfect for work.  They are not baggy but definitely plenty roomy for moving around, bending down and getting the job done.  I will definitely be purchasing more of these pants."
5.0,"These pants fit well, and loosen up slightly as they are broken in. They are lightweight but durable. I have worn  them everyday for work for the past few years. I own several colors"
3.0,Good but too small
5.0,I bought 3 pair of these.  Awesome!!!!  My go to  pants from now on.
5.0,Look great. My man wears a 36/30 should've gone 38/30 they shrink a little in dryer
5.0,"I ordered next waist size up per the reviews, fit comfortably.  She may or may not be right..."
5.0,THEY REALLY ARE NICE NOW I AM WAITING TO WASH THEM AND SEE HOW THEY DRY AND HOW MANY WRINKLES.  I WILL LET YOU KNOW.  THANKS
3.0,"I have always worn carharttt. I order 36 x 30, and these are way too tight and short. I would guess they are actually 34 x 28. I will still stick with Carhartt"
4.0,"Just like the others say, it runs small in the waist. I saw this and ordered larger than I normally wear. It still fits too snug for my liking and I need to go up two inches in the waist for comfort - which is going to be almost 3-4 inches above what I wear in other clothes. Also the zipper is not very long so there is not much room for the stuff down there...and I am a very average sized guy but I can tell before washing these pants that we are going to have a problem with the lack of room in the zipper area.
Now the pants look and feel great, nice and light, good length, they are sort of baggy in my opinion but not much at all, just loose fitting. So I will try again with a larger size or try the regular fit."
4.0,Son-in-law loves them.
5.0,AWESOME!  Great pants with a perfect fit for work or play...just bought another pair in a different color
5.0,"Carhartts are sized one size smaller in the waist and one size longer in the leg as compared to jeans. I remembered that, and they fit perfectly."
5.0,"Cant say enough about them, They're quality pants that fit like they should.  I am very pleased."
5.0,"Carhartt is my sportswear of choice for rugged good looking and pants that fit.  When I could not find the style that I wanted in the color I needed I turned to Amazon.  It did not take me long to find what I wanted in the size and color that I needed.  The price was great, the service excellent and when I am in need again I will be coming back."
5.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend, he loves them and they fit him great!"
4.0,Great pants will repurchase
5.0,"These are the only work pants that I buy. They are comfortable, durable and reasonably priced. The extra pockets come in quite handy for my cell phone or tools as needed. They also look good enough for a night out! I recommend these pants!"
5.0,"Great buy, quick shipping !!!"
5.0,Perfect! Husband loves the fit.
5.0,"Very happy, I will be buying more!"
5.0,Very durable and comfortable
5.0,Bought these for my hubby. He loves them and fit perfectly. They are great quality and wash well.
5.0,Great as usual
2.0,I order Carhartt for my husband all the time and this product fits completely different.
5.0,Love them
5.0,I finally had to get another pair. I'd been wearing the same pair for at least 2 days a week for 4 years. I still wear them but just to rough around the feet and stains. I will say that an iPhone 5s with life proof case does fit snug in the cell pocket on new carpenter pants.
5.0,"Great pair of pants, fit good. Wish they were a little but cheaper but you pay for quality"
5.0,"Hubby loves them, and wants more !!"
5.0,Good price! Very pleased with the pants!
5.0,"Every pair of jeans I own is a 40 waist (which for me is about a half size to big) and I like the way they fit. I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead. (A little side note to the big men. I have also found that Wrangler 20X style 33 ""extreme relaxed"" jeans also fit me and my bigger thighs well)"
5.0,My husband is one of the pickiest people I have ever met when it comes to the comfort of his clothes. Whenever he finds something comfortable he buys 5-6 pairs of them. These pants were true to size and my husband says they are extremely comfortable. They look very durable for work. We bought 5 pairs
3.0,"We purchased another pair of Carhartt pants the same style just the more recently sold version and the same size in the store and they fit perfect, these are a little on the smaller side..."
4.0,Great material. We ordered a bit large because previous pants from Carhartt had shrunk. I had to wash & dry on high several times to shrink. Still a bit long in the crotch & legs.
5.0,"Lite, great for warm weather, comfy fit"
4.0,Cool pants but I lost so much money buying Carhartts other garbage that I don't even want em ...
3.0,Same size I have purchased before. These fit larger.
5.0,"Great work pants. Fits exactly as expected. Roomy enough in the seat and the thighs, but not baggy. I'll be ordering more of these for sure."
5.0,Great work pants this is the 4th pair I've purchased for my husband he couldn't be happier with them
3.0,"Ok for casual wear.  Can't see them holding up to everyday outdoor work as they are pretty lightweight.  They were too small in the waist  and zipper would not stay closed, so I am returning them for the next size up.  I have other Carhartt's same size in the Relaxed Fit style that fit perfectly."
5.0,"Just what I expected from Carhartt pants at an awesome price!!  These are at least $15 - $20 cheaper than our Carhartt retail outlet.  They fit just as I expected them too.  I have big legs and have to have a loose fit pant and these are perfect, not baggy and not tight."
5.0,instantly comfortable and easy to wash so far it has been very durable
5.0,"Love these pants. As I've noticed for all Carhartt products, they run small. I normally wear 34's, but in Carhartt 36 is the way to go. They are stiff while being broken in, but they get quite comfy after a few washes. The pockets are huge, in the most excellent way."
5.0,Good work pants
3.0,"Good quality though, I will be ordering a bigger size."
4.0,"The pants are made with thin cloth, don't feel protected"
5.0,Good pants!
5.0,GREAT PANTS.  BUY THEM.
5.0,Very satisfied with this purchase!
4.0,I wear these to work and they fit sort of loose which I find more comfortable for all day use. I got a hole in them somehow in the first week but no issues since then.
3.0,"Very comfortable pants, not stiff like the canvas ones. How ever i own 9 pairs of these pants all the same size and they all fit different some are loose and baggy while others are short and slim their pants size really vary."
5.0,Great transaction - simple & right
5.0,I've purchased these before fit good comfortable and they have high back. Sick of low cut any thing. As a builder you put things in the pockets and pulling your pants up every two seconds gets old. These stay up.
5.0,"Should have bought these before I ever started landscaping. Best pants on Earth. Hold up to anything. Fit incredibly comfortable - no restriction of movement like jeans. I've got muscular legs that normally don't comfortable fit jeans, but these are great without being baggy.

You can wear them for days at work before having to switch to the next pair. I have 3 pairs now and never run out doing laundry once a week. Just hang them up after a day of work and put them right back on the next day with a little dirt on them, but these colors make it hard to see. Once they're noticeably dirty or get wet, I wear the next ones.

Have yet to notice any wear to any of my pairs after a few months of use."
1.0,I was charged $5.00 handling for something I could not use.  They were too small & the material was too thin.  It was a bad experience.
5.0,My favorite work pants
3.0,"Pants look fine but I am done ordering Carhartt pants on-line. Stupid me. I have tried on 3 different occasions now and every time have had to return them. I'm a 33"" waist so ordered 34"". I couldn't get close to buttoning them. I'd probably need 36"" waist for them to fit me. Be very cautious of size on these pants. I've given up."
4.0,Carhart pants are great!!
5.0,Absolutely fit perfect the cell phone pocket even holds my iPhone six which I didn't think it would it is larger than most so phones. Will probably order two more pair
3.0,A little tight but i guess if anything it just means now i have to exercise bc aside from being a bit tight in the waist there isn't any problems with the pants
1.0,Legs are to wide
5.0,"Great fit, got delivered fast!"
3.0,Fit ok at first. After the first wash in cold water and drying them low. They shrunk big time.
4.0,Carhartt products are the best for long lasting and durability. Love the side pockets.
5.0,great pant.  My husband loves these.
5.0,This is a replacement as my husband has almost worn out the others. He loves them.
3.0,"I love some aspects of these pants and hate others.
The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this. I believe there are fabric treatments that can greatly help this and are not too costly."
5.0,My husband loves these pants. Nice fit. Looks good on him.
5.0,Great all around!
5.0,Love these jeans.  Great fit.  Great Quality.
5.0,Great Pant.
5.0,"I was nervous about the sizes on these pants due to many reviews, but I still ordered my usual size and they fit perfect.  They are very comfortable and feel very durable. They fit over my work boots without any issues and the pockets are deep which I like. Ordered a second pair because I like them so much."
5.0,"I cut the hammer loops off because I don't like them, but otherwise these are great pants. The side pocket on the left outer thigh is big enough for just about any 5.0-5.5"" screened cell phone (even with case if the case isn't extra bulky.)"
5.0,"I was a little nervous buying these after reading some of the reviews. They fit him well and he loves them. Not sure where they were made. He is wearing them now, so can't exactly look at the tag."
5.0,"These paints fit better then I expected. They look good meaning they don't look like your typical carpenters jeans, people have said that I like your slacks. They are tough enough for everyday hard work. Furthermore, you can wear out dinner, church, ect..."
4.0,Very comfortable... I normally wear 32 waste but had to purchase 33 to fit properly though they do stretch a bit after wearing them. I did not notice any shrinkage from washing.
1.0,I don't understand why these fit much too small - my son has worn and continues to wear the exact same jeans in 34x32 - but these he can't even get on.
3.0,Fit small in the waist and inseam.
1.0,"Who makes these pants? They are NOT canvas, as I usually wear from Carhartt, and I can't see them lasting more than a month!
These are very light weight- made for summer months, perhaps. And they would still wear out fast. Lighter than denim.
I am very disappointed, as I need real work clothes right now for the winter months. First time I received anything sub-par from Amazon.
RRRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!"
5.0,"Good quality jeans , arrived on time and fit well , would Definayely buy again for my husband."
4.0,as expected
3.0,"These pants run small in the waist. I ordered the same size of the Levi jeans I wear, but these pants were much too small."
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants.  They are lightweight, comfortable, have the perfect amount of room in the seat and thigh, quick drying, and most importantly, they are incredibly tough.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and these are my new go-to for work pants."
5.0,Very nice!
5.0,nice jeans
5.0,"Holds up well! Nice and cool pants, I don't sweat as much in these as other work pants. Full range of motion. I have very large calves and these pants fit great. I have since ordered two more."
5.0,"Pants came as expected, but unfortunately we're too small. Need to exchange."
5.0,"Love the color, love the fit. Some of the best, rugged work jeans ever made!"
4.0,The pants are wonderful. My husband fit them so well.
3.0,material is lighter then expected
5.0,I can not find these in any local store and there great work pants
5.0,Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved them! A lot cheaper too through amazon!!
5.0,fit as expected  My husband really liked them
4.0,"look great, feel great, sized right."
5.0,delivered timely and intact
5.0,Fits him perfectly with given measurements.
5.0,"Great pants, tough and durable."
3.0,"Quality seems very good however these jeans are carpenter and loose fit and you really can't have both. They ran about a size too small when compared to true (just stated) carpenter jeans.
Shame because I was excited about this gift."
4.0,they good for work
5.0,Love these pants
5.0,"I was worried by some of the reviews that the size would not be correct, not so. Perfect"
5.0,They were marked 36 W 32 L but they were 36 inseam. Had to have a seamstress cut them off.
4.0,My husband is tall and sometimes difficult to fit.  His inseam is 34 inches which can be hard to find on the shelf with his waist size--I won't reveal that to prevent him getting upset with me.:)  The fabric is a sturdy weight yet flexible and moves with him.  He's very happy with the multiple pockets too.  We will definitely be purchasing more.
4.0,Pants are great.
5.0,perfect fit at great price
5.0,Great fit!
5.0,I bought these for my son and he loved them
5.0,Good durable fabric. Fits perfect.
5.0,My husband loves these pants.  Very comfortable fit.
3.0,"Loose fit I found out is bigger down the legs than I anticipated.  I feel like I'm wearing bell bottoms.  The ""relaxed fit"" is actually tapered a little bit and fit me great.  I bought two pairs of pants from Carhartt not paying attention to the style.  I'm not sure I'll like the ""loose fit"" (they will be washed & dried before I wear them) but I know I'll like my ""relaxed fit"" carpenter jeans."
5.0,These pants I ordered  fit very well just as they said  loose fit cell phone pocket very soft and comfortable would buy again priced wright.
5.0,"It is quite difficult to find pants that fit what I would call a normal man, they all seem to be incredibly tight around the thighs and crotch area it's as if man hating women design pants for men these days leaving us real men with no room for our man parts with all of these ""skinny jeans"" NO real men wear skinny jeans. We need a little room.
Well guys, look no further, I have found the quintessential work pants for the real men that are left with their parts intact.
Very comfortable in all the important areas, and great for carpenters (of which I am one) hammer holsters, a few pockets for a utility knife or other hand tools and they appear to be tough, time will tell.
Do yourself a favor and try a pair."
4.0,"These look reallly nice, and wash and wear well.  Very popular with the young men!"
5.0,Good fit and great pants
5.0,"great fit, fast shipping"
4.0,They fit and are comfortable
5.0,I have had this brand before but they discontinued the style I liked. These were the closest I could find to my old favorites. These are just perfect for me and my day to day life.
5.0,"I work in the construction field, and I'm constantly having trouble with jeans tearing, especially now when even good old reliable Levis are thin as paper. I used to wear Silver Tab Levi's, but the cut of the jean is now so messed up I can't fit into them and feel comfortable. So I ordered two pairs of these Carhartts, and I couldn't be happier. Just remember, like others have said, get the waist one size bigger, and the length one size shorter, and they should fit you as expected."
5.0,Great
5.0,Pants are excellent and fit great
5.0,"These pants are awesome, very durable. Bought some other colors after wearing them for a day."
5.0,"Timely delivery, fit better than expected, lighter than dickies but somehow seems tougher"
5.0,Christmas gift.  Just what I wanted.  Hard to get in the store.
5.0,Best work/outdoor pants I have ever wore. Rugged but stylish with plenty of room and pockets
5.0,Green jean that fit
5.0,I've been wearing these pants for years now...you cant go wrong!
4.0,"kinda long , measured them at 33in not 32in length."
5.0,I ordered these for my husband & they are great quality & pricing was as good if not better than the stores.
4.0,Sharp looking jeans and color. Great fit from a quality company and name !!
5.0,Very comfortable and sturdy
5.0,The fit and feel is fantastic!
3.0,"They fit, they clean up well and they have a cell phone pocket! just one problem it is easy to confuse the hammer loop on the right side with the cell phone pocket and the results can be disastrous! A simple change in the loop or pocket position would make a big difference!!"
5.0,bought a couple pairs last year had same problem they run small other than that my son & son in law luv them
5.0,Very nice
2.0,"I've bought a few pairs of canvas pants from other brands and have been really happy with them.  So I figured that spending the extra money on a pair of Carhart's might be worth the extra money, I was very disappointed in the quality of the fabric, very thin and cheap feeling IMO.
Most of the other pairs of canvas pants I've bought have been around $25, these were $40...I'd much rather buy two pairs of other brands for only $10 more than the Carhart's.  I feel like I'm spending $15 on the Carhart name and not for added quality or craftsmanship.
I'm going to return these."
5.0,these are a great pair of Jeans
5.0,good work pants for a tinknocker!!  well fitting  and constructed
3.0,"Like the waist fit ,but the length was about an inch to long. Loose fit is loose for sure, Will wash in wear for the season. Then post update on comfort and durability."
4.0,As expected
5.0,"there is not much to say abt this product bt they are as I expected,love the way they fit I will be ordering more."
4.0,"I hate trying to find pants that fit, a size 40 is always too big and a 38 always seems to be too tight even relaxed fit but, these size 38 loose fit we're just right. I was nervous buying them online without trying them on but, if you have the same problem as I do when trying to find pants that aren't as tight as a 38 original or relaxed and not as loose as a size 40 try these out."
1.0,"OH my goodness, my first Carhartt that my husband hated. It runs WAY small, he is definitely a 38 waist and has trim legs and is tall. He couldn't get these past his calf! Loose-Fit, in what universe? Had to return, thank goodness the refund was quick."
2.0,"I've worn Carhartt's my whole life, excellent pant. This version is *not* their ultra tough version so don't expect great durability. These are more for going around town, not working.

The one problem I found is they're HUGE! Both in length and width, these are far too big compared to other Carhartt pants I've bought in the same exact size. Make sure to drop one size if you buy these."
5.0,"Great product, great deal!!!!"
5.0,"The limiting factor on pants is crotch room.  If it ain't there, it ain't gonna work.  These are not absurdly baggy, but they do give just a bit of extra room there so I'm not squeezed.  Very comfy.  The material is a little stiff at first but softens nicely.  Like any cotton pants, the pants length shrinks a good inch or more, but the waist (and crotch length) remains unchanged.  I bought a second pair."
5.0,"Tough, comfortable and great all around jeans. At this price, you should have a closet full."
5.0,Fantastic work wear. Great fit. Delivered on time.
5.0,"For the last 10 years I have bought all my work clothes from Duluth Trading, sadly each year the prices went up until finally they priced themselves out of my life. I bought these pants from Amazon at a great price, and I will tell you I love them. I have been wearing them 10 hours a day for two weeks, they are the right size and very comfortable for me."
5.0,"This is my second pair. After reading reviews at first I ordered one inch larger in the waist. Fit well but a little large in waist. This time I ordered my size. The same size I wear in Boss, Levis, and everything else. Fits perfect!

To those that say these pants are small, I'd took a look at the bathroom scale. Then head to the gym."
1.0,"For the price, I expected better quality.  After a few washings, the color runs off the thigh areas and mostly at the knees just like a cheap jeans.  This undesirable effect is much more pronounced in the darker colors (e.g. Navy blue or black).  The pants looks old after just a few washings because of the inconsistent color loss.

After a few more washings, the material starts to fray, tear and deteriorate along the edges of the pockets and at the bottom of the legs.

If you are looking for a heavy-duty durable pair of pants for work, this brand is not for you."
2.0,"I purchased these to be work pants worn as a DIY'er home renovator.  The fabric is just swiss cheese after about a dozen wearings.  I have never had fabric just open up all over the place like this.  It is not the seems, the fabric itself doesn't hold up."
5.0,These pants fit well. A good price for Carhart pants.
5.0,"Love these pants perfect amount of pockets for all my things (tools, Cell phone, etc.). Love the color and the durable feel. They are lighter weight then some of my other pairs but I prefer this. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants the great quality products that Carhartt makes."
5.0,Great quality.
5.0,superb fit in waist and legs. length was just right!
4.0,"Pants were as descibed in product description, size was good, fit loose in leg all round good work pants."
5.0,Recommend for men.
4.0,Fit is closer to what size I would wear for khakis. I thought they would be closer to jeans.
5.0,Very comfortable
5.0,As always a great product been wearing them for about 10 years
5.0,Always quality pants with a good fit.
5.0,great pants
4.0,LOVE THEM. NEED ANOTHER COLOR
5.0,"Soft and comfortable but still a bit too big, going to swap out for a smaller size. If your buying these get your size or smaller"
5.0,"It is hard - so hard - to find pants that hold up well and also look good. You find straight leg this, ugly blue that, skinny jeans, baggy jeans, dad jeans. It's frustrating.

These pants from Carhartt are not only functional and durable, they're damn good looking. The colors they come in are neutral, but attention grabbing. I've already had a few people ask me where I got my pants from. They go good with pretty much any shoe/shirt combo.

I've got kind of a thing for Carhartt ever since buying the best cold-weather hoodie I've ever owned from them last year, and the fact that these pants are as good as they are has solidified my business with them I think."
5.0,Like the way they fit and feel and the color.  The side pocket is good for a cell phone.
3.0,These pant started slightly small and shrank further on washing  Length is short.
5.0,"Fits perfect, nice sturdy material!!"
5.0,These pants are very well made. The fit is as expected. I am pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Just what I wanted
5.0,Pants fit as expected and they are extremely comfortable.  I removed the hammer loops and I love having a small pocket on each side of the pants.  This is one of three pairs of Carhartt pants I have purchased and they are all wonderful.  I wanted to get away form cargo pants and these definitely hit the mark.
3.0,Kind of tight
5.0,"Very nice,  amazing price!"
5.0,Love these pants! I don't wear anything else. If they had more colors I would buy more
5.0,"I've been looking for a good pair of khaki pants for work. I have finally found them! I teach middle school technology and need a durable pant that can withstand tools, but still look professional. The loose-fit provides plenty of room, but not baggy. I love the small side pocket for my phone without making these pants look like cargo pants. The sizing was spot on for me. At 40 dollars, it's a bit more than I'd like to spend, but I find these are worth it. I like these pants so much, I bought 3 more pair."
5.0,Good deal. Couldn't find this color locally for the loose fit.
5.0,"I love the way these pants fit for me. I have larger than average thighs and butt (thank you powerlifting), so it can sometimes be a challenge to find trousers that fit comfortably. I appreciate that these have the room that I need without my having to buy a bigger waist size and cinch it in with a belt.

The fabric seems more durable than other brands of demin I have tried, but magically, it is softer than expected. I will certainly buy these again before I buy another pair of Wrangler or Levi."
5.0,Great pair of durable pants
4.0,Fits perfectly and great quality
5.0,"These fit better than expected and are very comfortable to work in. The pockets are good. I'm 6'7"" tall and these had plenty of length."
4.0,Slightly tight at the waist but I may have ordered one size too small.
5.0,Very good pant
5.0,"These are my favorite ""office casual"" pants. They look good and are incredibly comfortable.

They may be a little thinner than jeans, but the fabric seems pretty durable. I now have three colors and can't find anything to complain about.

Wife says they make my butt look good, too. Score!"
5.0,Good
5.0,Of course these are great workpants.  They're Carhartt.
3.0,Legs and thighs are comfortable but the butt area of the pants is a little tight for a loose fit
5.0,Nice color and fits as expected
5.0,"These quickly became my most comfortable pair of pants. Arrived more quickly than expected, too."
5.0,Great pair of pants - - I've been wearing them for years now and they are still well made and comfortable
5.0,"Gosh, they look good!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,"Good sturdy canvas fabric. Lightweight for summer. I am a carpenter, and these are loose enough to all me to easily bend, squat & move. Good array of pockets, and my iPhone easily fits in the side-leg pocket. I'll be getting more of these."
5.0,"hubby loves Carhartt, wears them everyday."
4.0,like all carhartt pants and shorts i have had these pants have to be ordered at least one size larger.  this has not been the case with their shirts but always with pants.
4.0,Will buy againg !!!
5.0,"Love these pants.  Can be hot in the summer, but super durable."
2.0,I have purchased Carhartt pants before and they fit comfortably.  This pair was too long and I had to pay a local seamstress to take them up an inch.
4.0,"Not as loose fit as others in the same size and category, but wearable.  They seem well made and durable.  If they last, I will buy again."
4.0,"Size fits spot on but in a loose and comfortable way.  Legs are a bit big at the end, like bell-bottoms, but not bad.  Quality is good, yet another solid buy from Carhartt."
5.0,"My husband loves these pants but they are kind of hard to find. We found all the colors here and the size fits exactly as the ones he bought in  the local store. We purchased the navy blue, and were kind of worried it would be too bright, but it is a true navy blue and looks great. The pants are durable and wear well. They do become softer with repeated washings but do not look worn out. Now that I can find them, I will be buying more for my husband."
4.0,Great shorts and fit well but shrink with every washing and drying.  Order one waist size larger.
3.0,"The pants are sold as ""loose -fit""  which they are not.  I just returned a 36 waist for a 38 waist size (that makes me feel good:) . As for the rest they look and feel good- and that would get the product more stars.  I would highly suggest getting the next size."
5.0,Will order more pairs
5.0,great quality and feel. I bought the pants a size larger for comfort and with the loose fit they are quite baggy but they are of great quality so its a menial problem
5.0,excelente
5.0,I have looked or a good place to buy Carhartt jeans in all colors and sizes at a good price with no luck. UNTIL NOW !!! all th colors you want and sizes you need awsome
5.0,Favorite work pants of all time.
5.0,"Good product, good price!"
5.0,Great pants. Room to move and work pockets are awesome. Comfortable for larger built men
5.0,Very comfortable.
4.0,"The first pair were dead on, fit in the waist. The second pair..not so much. But that seems to be true in all clothing. And other brands wear just as long"
5.0,"Great looking pair of pants! Fit as expected. And even though they are described as loose fit, they are slimmer than the regular fit B151. Great pants for work and casual wear."
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants. They fit so well and they are really comfortable, light weight and plenty of leg room. They do run 1/2 size smaller in the waist but fit me perfectly, I don't need a belt. Will be buying plenty more of these pants real soon."
4.0,I bought these for my husband. They fit great on him which was great after reading some reviews regarding sizes not being accurate. My husband requested that I buy another pair for him.
5.0,good
5.0,"Length was great. Waste was just a little small but not uncomfortable. I have never ordered my clothing online before  but anymore in order to find my size thats what I have to do. 36"" inseams are not readily available in stores. The pants feel great. Will definitely order again. This time I ordered 5 pairs."
4.0,"im a big guy that needed some khaki pants and carharts last so that's what I went with, they work like a charm"
4.0,Really comfy nice loose fit I usually wear the B11 but their a little heavy for summer these are about right for the hot summer months. 4 stars because I like them on the waist and these are little below. Will buy again.
5.0,"My husband loves these pants. He said they were the most comfortable pants he has ever worn, as a matter of fact- I am going to order another pair of them for him.  They look good for work casual wear."
1.0,I ordered 31x32 and the length was more like 34. Really baggy as well. I will definitley return these and order the relaxed fit.
4.0,"I have a waist size of 39, so the fit is just a little large.......but I love the style and fit because it's comfort personified. Just make for the in between sizes and instead of four and a half it would have been a clear five."
2.0,"MENS CARHARTS/WHY. always liked them,but it seems that they make the pant legs just too too wide look at other makers and you will see the different in them size wise,although i love buying from amazon they can use some tips and advise about clothes i take my clothes really serious,and always make sure i look nice even if im not going anywhere thank you"
5.0,Great looking and fit. I'm a young guy and still care how I look but wanted a pant that would hold up to repeated punishment. I would rate these as rugged as jeans and a good alternative.
5.0,"Material is lightweight for summer, but tough. I purchased one pair to check the fit and cloth. Found the pants to be of high quality and comfortable. After two weeks of use I bought two additional pair of the same size and found the fit to be consistent for all three pairs."
5.0,All i wear are carhartt pants. I wish they made this canvas carpenter design in more than 3 colors because I have 2 pairs of each. These are the most comfortable pants that I have ever owned. They are breathable and not rough like the typical work pants. This is my favorite color as well.
2.0,The pants arrived with a giant stain on the knee area.  They are work pants so im not gonna go into the trouble of returning but was still pretty upset
5.0,"I bought a khaki pair from a retailer but they didn't have the grey in my size.  These came on time and fit as expected. Good price as well. Bonus, the wife loves them on my as well ;)"
4.0,"The legs are a bit long for my size but overall I like it. The color is just fine, thanks"
5.0,"These pants are excellent quality and exceptionally well-made.  They are perfect for any occasion, and they are a comfortable fit."
5.0,"I'm a large 36...and they fit me perfect. I really like them. I haven't worn them to work yet so I cannot give a total review but...plenty of room to move around.
I still like them although...the fabric on these last 2 pair leaves a lot to be desired...by 11-1-16 I have holes in both knees on both pair.
I will not buy again (I have ordered 4 pair in the past and it took quite a bit longer to develop holes)
I will try the double knees 1 time and see it it is better...if not...no more"
5.0,"Lightweight, durable, looks great, has plenty of pockets, and is not too hot when it heats up but provides enough warmth in the winters in southeast Texas.  Will be buying many times over when my other pants are wearing out."
5.0,"My husband liked these carpenter pants even better than previous ones that he had in denim - excellent weight, fit and quality of material - and excellent service by Elite Hero!"
5.0,"Excellent pants.  Roomy, comfortable.  Seems to be a lighter version of regular types of blue jeans, consequently, not as hot as regular jeans.  I normally take a size 33 waist pants, but this pants was way too tight and for the first time in my life,  I had to order a size 35 waist, which fit me perfectly.  Liked the pants so much,  I ordered another pair.  Perfect for hot hard work conditions.  Moss green hides dirt stains really great also."
5.0,"Lots of subtle pockets on both hips are what makes these pants nice.  Many of us need those extra pockets for things like, keys, wallet, phone, large pocket knife, mini pocket knife, pistol, etc.  These pants accommodate your EDC every day carry items.  The key word is ""subtle,"" and Carhartt did a great job integrating these pockets in a way that doesn't draw too much attention."
5.0,"If your looking for a pair of pants that will show off the brand of briefs you are wearing these are not for you. If though you are looking for a proper fitting work pants, here you go. I am a MOW railroader and  need pants that wear well and fit well. theses are the ones. Have been wearing the B159 for years. They say loose fit but seem just right."
5.0,With Carhartt you get a quality product. I find that I always get what I pay for and they last a long time. Great for work.
3.0,"It seems that Carhartt has compromised with quality in an effort to stay competitively priced, like most manufactures are doing now.
It's happening with most products. Packages have become smaller, quantities are less, etc. to keep the price the same. I purchased these very pants 2 years ago and the fabric is MUCH thinner, although it says canvas. I have struggled to find a durable work pant in my size, and thought Carhartt was my best option until now. Unfortunately, Carhartt has discontinued my size, therfore I thought I would buy all 3 pair. I also ordered from another supplier who indicated that they could not fulfill the order due to the size being discontinued. I do not plan to return these because they fit. My experience with the seller is not the issue, but thought they should be aware.
Thanks again"
5.0,They run small order up one size bigger light weight limited colors and baggy in the hips other than that cathartic
5.0,"These pants are comfortable, easy to maintain. I like them because they have pockets for my glasses case and a cell phone. They are utilitarian while at the same time are dressy enough for day to day office wear."
5.0,The fit is loose but not too baggy.  Very nice color as well. I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't like the heavy fit of jeans.
5.0,"My husband loved these pants.  He said that they fit him much more comfortable and looser than relaxed fit ones did, that he ended up returning back to amazon.  Colors are good, wear is good...you can work or dress them up if you need to.  A good buy all the way around for my Honey!!  We ordered 4 pairs of the carhartt men's lose fit canvas carpenter pant"
5.0,"Most carhartt pants are too high waisted for my husband, but these fit the bill.  They are a very competitive price on amazon and fit right for the man that doesn't want his pants under his chest.  He likes his pants just under his belly.  He's 50.  We ordered the 32 length which is his usual size and thought they were too long when we got them but after washed, they are a great length and none too short.  Just right.  He's glad carhartt is finally seeing a market for the below waist fit."
2.0,Pants fit too big for 32x32. I need more words... NIne Eight Seven Six Five Four Three Two One Done
5.0,"For years I've been stuck in limbo where most pants only come in even sizes. This has aggravated me for years because 30x32 is too tight and 32x32 is too loose; but then I happened to see some Carhartt's in an outdoors store. I was surprised to see they make 31x32 so I bought a pair. I was worried they would become too tight after washing, but when washed and dried these fall right within the exact size they specify. These pants are durable, nice looking, nice fitting and last awhile. This is the 3rd pair to my collection because these pants are clearly made to last. You get what you pay for with these. They're not cheap - but neither is the quality. 100% cotton canvas made in the U.S. - I will forever be a Carhartt's kid!"
5.0,There tailored to fit. I have searched for a while looking for the perfect fit. Thank you for making my pants life better
3.0,"Every time I buy a pair of Carhartt carpenter pants they turn out to be a slightly different material and a slightly different color and different pocket configurations.  I wish I could get a pair like the first ones I had, they even had a little tab to hang a tape measure on.  These are okay, just not quite the same."
2.0,How can I return the jeans for a smaller size I need a 30x 30 for my husband email me n let me know thanks
4.0,"Buying these pants, I thought they were a more work and tough pant, but after I opened them, It seemed like they were more of a causal pant rather than work. With that said, I will still use them for around the yard or work garage. The Material is thin, more like dress pants."
2.0,"This was my third pair of the the same style and size. This pair came in approximately 4"" longer in the leg. Will have to take them to a tailor to fix as I have to roll them 3 times so they don't drag on the floor. Waist sizing was spot on."
5.0,these pants fit me like a glove. They are the first pants I have ever had that fit so well. I have large thighs and a short waist and the fit is fantastic. I have always loved the extra pockets for my phone and such too.
5.0,"I have about ten pairs of these pants in different colors and wear them everyday.  As a field service technician I constantly find myself on the floor, under desks, behind equipment, etc.  and my work clothes really take a beating.  These pants have held up really well and show little signs of wear after a year of service (even the color has not faded).

The only improvement to these pants would be to remove the ""hammer loops"", as they get in the way of the cell phone and utility pockets (or you can just cut them off like I did).  I had never purchased a Carhartt product before these and now that's all I wear!"
5.0,"I'm peeved that these are $10 less than I paid.
These are not made in the US now, mine were made in Mexico.

They seem to be good quality, great loose fit in the crotch, legs and back end. I like the 2 side pockets and loops, my smart phone fits in one and a can of snuf in the other.
The seams and stitching looks uniform, my only complaint is one side pocket was to tight for my phone.
I ordered the navy blue for 2 pairs, mistake there it showed up everything. I
thought I'd put them in a light bleach wash to dull em out. They came out a duck jean color, I like it better."
1.0,"mens size is not accurate.  Waist was small, the fit was not at all right.  I would not recommend these pants."
5.0,These pants will last! The material is thinner than some others so these are great for summer. I will buy more!
5.0,"My husband has a closet full of these pants. They wear well, wash well, and are very sturdy. They are also just a little nicer than regular jeans."
5.0,My husband loves these carhartts for work and casual wear. He is hard on clothes but these are durable and lasting him well.
5.0,"Waist size is 36 where in jeans I'm 34, FYI.  These pants are perfect for working or casual wear, very comfortable and so far seem very durable!"
5.0,These were a gift to my nephew.  He says they are his favorite pants now.  I will probably buy him another pair for his Birthday!
5.0,I love these pants! I run a pest control company and constantly have to work in crawl spaces and around houses. I have beat the crap out of them many times  and they look better all the time. I now own 3 pairs but my favorite are my oldest( broke in ) pair. They look thin compared to other carhartt's but don't let the thinner feel fool you. They will hold up to whatever damage you put them through and will still look great. I get many compliments on them and plenty of attention from women. I don't see myself going back to jeans  or other pants anytime soon.
5.0,"Best pants on the market because of their durability  They wear as they say ""like iron"" compared to just regular jeans like lee jeans which rip at the back pockets"
5.0,"Easy to order & quick delivery!

These are the perfect work pants! Heavy duty and great fit! Multiple colors and sizes to fit all."
2.0,"Not really happy with the fit of these pants, sent them back as they were too small.  I love the cargo pants that Amazon sells on here which has a great fit."
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants!  I wear these, in multiple colors, daily at work and they are perfect for my needs.  They are comfortable, don't shrink in the wash, color doesn't fade and there are enough pockets to keep all your things separate!  Great product!"
5.0,"I bought these pants for my husband who is in construction and they have now become his favorite work pants. He is a Project Manager and when he has to meet with Homeowners these are his dressy construction pants because of the khaki color, cut and fabric weight; but he can still work in them. I think that the pants run a little long/inseam; he normally wears a 34 inseam but I should have ordered him a 32 inseam."
5.0,They fit  great . They are the  light weight ones. Next time I need to check the onces and get a heavier one
4.0,"Very good quality, if you order these pants you must order the next size up. I am a true 33 waist and these pants are 34 and just fit."
2.0,"size is inaccurate. this was at least one size too big in every direction. quality seems lower than the many other carhartt pants I have - thin, odd fitting"
5.0,I have worn the B159 and FRB159 for several years for work.  Very comfortable.  I often wear them to other places other than work.
5.0,"Carhartt Men's Loose-Fit Canvas Carpenter Pant B159, Charcoal, 38x32, Just like the Carhartt shorts I love with two pockets for my cell phones"
4.0,Bougth to wear for work have had no problems but wish the material was thicker. good deal for the price.
5.0,"My measurements in Wrangler, Wrangler RIGGS, and 'most' other brand pants is 40-42"" Waist, 34"" Inseam (this is for Loose fit clothing).
For Carhartt (Loose Fit pants) I ordered one size larger [than Wrangler] based on customer reviews / recommendations (from Amazon, Sierra Trading Post, and Working Person Store) and this hindsight worked perfectly; 42X34 fits great. The pants are SOOOO comfortable and give a very-very good amount of crotch room (you won't be adjusting your underwear / removing weggies every time you sit down / stand-up).

*If you like Wrangler Loose fit products and HATE having inadequate crotch-room I highly recommend these pants, just order one size larger (in the waist) than your normal size. Hope this helps!"
5.0,"Great fit, heavier than regular slacks - just right for my job  -- I move around a lot and bend and stretch - perfect!"
5.0,"They fit great, had other carhartt's before and I am sure these will hold up just as good. Definitely going to buy more like these in the near future."
5.0,"I've been wearing Carhartt work pants for at least a decade or more. In the past I've experienced extremely high durability in their Dungaree pants with the double layer front legs which are perfect on cold winter work days but, just waaaaaay too HOT in the spring/summer. The single layer Dungaree has worked out fine for those warmer days but, I've just never really been totally satisfied with the cut & feel of these pants even though I wore them years on end not having any better alternative UNTIL... discovering the B159 'Loose Fit' pants. Now wearing them for 2 years+,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carhartt-Men-s-Loose-Fit-Canvas-Carpenter-Pant-B159/dp/B002G9U8LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carhartt Men's Loose-Fit Canvas Carpenter Pant B159</a>&nbsp;they are my standard. They fit much more comfortably, feel softer, and are always reached for first in my pants pile even if it means searching through the entire stack if it turns out that they are all already in the dirty clothes bin! They do wear out into thin spots or holy knees about a year sooner than the Dungarees but, feel MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE all along the way!!!! On line to buy four more today."
5.0,Use for Sat installation and hold up really well to snags or sharp objects. If I had been wearing my Levis I would have had to replace many of times. They do not hold up to well to stains like grease or oils too much A real hard cleaning is needed for that and they do tend to fade some. Other than that I will continue to purchase
3.0,"I have about 8 pair of carhartt pants in three different styles that I wear the same size in. They all fit great. These pants are just exactly how they are described. Low waist, which translates to low sagging crotch which makes inseam hang two or three inches longer at my feet. Material was great. Right hand leg pocket was smaller than my other pants which is where I keep my phone, very tight fit for iPhone in a case. Sent them back. Read description closely if ordering"
5.0,They move well and last a long time.  Will certainly buy more in the future.  Good for an everyday pant or work pant.
5.0,"I was surprised how comfortable these are. The color is the same as the photo, which I am seeing is rare on Amazon clothing. It isn't really a charcoal color as you can see by the photo, but that is fine with me. The ""cell phone pockets"" are kind of useless with any newer phone, but I like the look anyway. They mean flip phones and whatnot, it won't fit an iphone or samsung galaxy. I ordered my normal length with 1 size up waist, and it fits perfectly. My normal waist size would have been too tight. Glad I bought these."
1.0,"POOR QUALITY, NOT RUGGED ENOUGH FOR TODAYS WORK PROJECTS AND CANNOT STAND UP TO THE CARHART NAME BRAND I KNOW SO WELL"
2.0,"waist was a bit low, kind of gave you a wedgie if you pulled them up even a little bit and also with larger sizes."
5.0,"Rugged, stylish, great fit and quick ship. They fit well, might run just a shade long, but not enough that you should order a size down."
4.0,"I like the way they fit, but the material is a little light for work pants.  I hope they hold up."
5.0,My husband has worn these for several years for work.  They look nice and are durable for quite some time.  He works outside and they take a beating.  He does wear them out eventually but that is because he has a job that causes a lot of wear and tear.
4.0,Awesome to get the actual size 35 waist fits like it should on me...these are a light weight canvas and look good etc.
5.0,I couldn't be happier with these pants. They were exactly what I was looking for. Not too dressy and durable. The size was accurate too.
5.0,"These pants fit me perfectly.
I would recommend these to all my friends and family.
The price is a great deal also."
1.0,"I ordered a charcoal color of these pants a while back.  They fit OK.  I usually order the thicker material pants from Carhartt and they always fit perfectly around the butt area.  I ordered a pair of ""Golden Khaki"" colors of these last week, assuming that they would be similar to the charcoal ones.  Looks like they are literally, no exaggeration, cut for women with extra large behinds.  Several washes in hot water and hot drier cycle do not seem to have made a difference.  Unfortunately I already cut those two funky side loops off as I usually do to Carhartt pants, so cannot return them.  They are sitting on my donation to charity pile right now."
4.0,"The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that I did manage to wear these out. Although it took much longer to do that than other pants I've had in the past, I did manage to wear them out. I own 4 pairs of these pants and it took me about 4 months to wear out one pairs.
On Carhartt's website they go for $48 plus about $12 for processing and shipping. So the total ends up at $60. When I saw them on Amazon Prime for $39 I was pretty stoked. It's a great deal.
They are super comfortable and contrary to the general consensus of Carhartt being stiff and rough pants, these are actually very soft and flexible. I will definitely be buying more."
5.0,"Pros:
-Fit
-Comfort
-Color
-Extra-pockets
-Carhartt brand

Cons:
Not made in the US. Otherwise no other problems with the product."
3.0,"I ordered these pants in the Dark Brown color today (June 26, 2013). I was very excited as I love this brand of pant. As I placed my order the pants showed as being ""in stock"" (and still do by the way). A couple hours later I received an email from Midwest Workwear informing me that my color choice was not in stock and wouldn't be until the Fall. They did offer me some other color choices, but none in which I had interest.

I canceled my order and now have to wait for a refund of my funds (some in the form of a gift card for my birthday). I wish that Midwest Workwear would have policed their offering on Amazon providing accurate information on what is actually available. Perhaps when they see this feedback they will."
5.0,"I am a forester and work outside in very hot weather. These are the best pants I've ever worn - I own 4 pairs. Carhartts aren't cheap, these are worth it. They are heavy duty, and breath pretty well. They dry pretty fast - if you've ever worked a Louisiana forest in July you know what I'm talking about.

These are a little baggy so a 30 inch waist hangs a little loose -- plenty of legroom for moving around. I wear them when climbing, but the legs are a little loose for that."
5.0,This is my second pair of Carhartt pants and I really like them. You can't go wrong with cotton. These are well made pants and fit comfortably. This is a brand and style that I would buy again.
5.0,"Durable, comfortable, nice extra pockets.  Great value.  Can't think of any negatives.  I do disagree with what another reviewer said about these pants running small.  My 34x32 pair is perfect."
5.0,"Nice pants, great fit at my 6'3"" height. My only real concern is even though I got the same model number on several pairs of these some seem to be made of a lighter weight canvas/duck than others. These were a light weight soft but durable pair but the moss pair can almost stand up in the corner on their own. The side leg pockets fit my comically large phone easily. I will keep buying these as long as they keep making them."
5.0,"The Title says it all, I was wandering how the fit would be by not being able to try them on and it was perfect."
5.0,"These are a great choice for people who need durable work pants, but want something that is lightweight and breathes.  The mushroom color is also really nice.  I have purchased several pairs of these exact pant, as I work on airplanes and they get put through the wringer with wear and grease.  They hold up and still look good, I love them."
3.0,"The pants are okay the problem I have is with the consistency of the size.  You can order three pairs and none will be exactly the same size.  The length on one was too short and another pair too long.  Buying these jeans is a lot like bignGoldilocks some are too big, some are too small and some are just right.  It is a hit or miss for these pants."
2.0,"Tight in the waist and big in the legs.  Size up on the waist, I'm usually a 33 and had to go with a 35 to fit right."
4.0,"The fit is good, which is always an issue when ordering online.  Feel is good as well.  I would recommend."
4.0,"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans. Items that ride comfortably in the watch pocket of my other carpenter jeans either don't fit, or ride up and dig into my side, if I stick them in the change pocket of these pants."
3.0,"NO TO BAD BUT I PREFER  THE B-11 FOR ME THOSE THE BEST ,  BUT  I  RECOMMEND TO ANYONE  YOU  STILL LOOK GOOD."
5.0,I bought these pants for my boyfriend....he loves them.  I would buy this item again. It is very difficult to find pants thar fit him' but Amazon made it easy!
5.0,We previously purchased this product.  My husband likes the comfort fit and the lower side pocket to carry his cell phone. He has used this purchase for the last 3 years.
5.0,"This is a very high quality product, and by far my favorite pair of jeans.
I also own a pair of flannel-lined Carhartts, which are great for Winter."
5.0,i love the quality of the clothes they wear well and last longer and carhartt is a name everyone can trust
4.0,"Like other reviewers, runs small (normally a 35 or 36 but the 38 fit well), but much lighter weight than a few pair I purchased a few years ago. Hopefully they hold up well..."
3.0,This turned out to be a lot lighter in weight than the other Carhartts I have. Now they just sit in a drawer.
2.0,The sizes advertized were not where delivered.  I'm guessing these were misfits or problem products in the beginning.  Guess I'll just have to use the store for hubbies needs.
5.0,"Lightweight yet durable. I prefer these over the other types of pants carhartt makes especially those made of canvas. They hold their own and I love the extra pockets for writing utensils, knives or whatever you need!"
5.0,This is one of many pairs of Carhartt pans I own and the wear like steel.  The fit is good (for me at least) and they are also comfortable.  I've had some pairs for 2 years and I wear each of them at least once or twice a week.  i wouldn't hesitate to order more the next time I need pants.
5.0,"My husband needed another pair of work pants for weekend projects. He's always liked Carhartts and I thought I was ordering the model he already had. These carpenter pants are a little lighter than the heavy canvas that he currently wears (my mistake) but are even better for our hot climate. He'll be able to wear them through the summer. Now I need to order another pair or two so they can occasionally be laundered. And as always, Amazon service is first rate."
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  They have held up great & wash and dry well with no shrinking!
5.0,"My husband is 6'6"" so finding pants that work can be hard. With the 38x36 loose fit, he really likes them. If it wasn't the loose fit, it wouldn't fit right for his height."
5.0,My husband wears a pair of these pants on the work site every day and swears by them. They have a sturdy quality and nice look/fit.
5.0,"In true Carhart fashion you never know what you are going to get until they actually arrive and you try them on. They were 2"" longer than the tagged size."
5.0,"Recommendation shop for excellent sales, delivery and articles.
Thank you very much for the good quality of service, keep it up!"
4.0,"Comfy, tough and cheap. Not exactly designer jeans, but they're great bouldering pants!! Carhartt's sizing system is one of the mysteries of the universe, but these fit pretty true-to size. Maybe a little on the small side (ie, maybe order one inch larger waist size than you usually do...)."
3.0,"I bought  pants 40"" on amazon pants without any problem, I ventured to buy these pants the same size but turned out to be much smaller...."
5.0,"I have tried a number of these pants over the past few weeks.  I have been looking for a durable pair of pants to use for work around the house.  But I wanted a pair of pants I could keep on when stepping out for lunch or picking up the kids.  These pants fit well, have great pockets .... just perfect.  I even played a quick game of hockey with my son & fell in the street.  The pants held up great with no rips or tears.  I'm going back to buy more soon."
5.0,"I swear by Carhartt pants and these do not disappoint.  Perfect combination of durable, comfortable, and functional.  Highly recommend the product and you simply cannot beat the price Amazon offers."
5.0,"These are good quality pants, have little pockets on each leg (for cellphones, etc.), and come in the size and color as ordered."
5.0,I work outside all day and I need pants that don't slip down- obviously. The high waist of these trousers make these the most comfortable fit for me ever. I now have the heavier cotton variety too.
4.0,After looking for a time I have found a replacement for my carpenter pants that are wearing out. I have purchased both the relaxed and loose fit jeans to help me decide what works as a year round work jean. The loose is much better for the cold weather (due to layers) and leave lots of room to still feel comfortable throughout my day. The relaxed is a slightly tighter fit. I prefer the loose.
4.0,"I really like these because of the color selection and the position of the front pockets (more like blue jeans vice the slash style pocket opening). They are a lightweight canvas (nice) and very comfortable. Carhartt always produces a good product. They run true to size for me (I have numerous types of Carhartt pants). Intend to replace all my ""khaki"" twill pants with these."
5.0,My son requested these pants and loves them!  He will wear the pants until they can't be worn anymore!  You guys are the best!
3.0,Have purchased many pairs of pants in the past. The material in this pair is much thinner than any I have bought in the past. I don't expect them to last as long.
5.0,"bought these to replace my ripped ones, not the same model, I ordered the wrong ones, but these worked out well, light weight but still warm."
4.0,"It's hard to find work pants in my size and color.  My job requires navy blue, and they were my size.  An added bonus is that they are cotton so they stay cool.  Very good deal for me.  I will buy more."
5.0,"just as advertised, comfortable, durable, fit perfect. great for carpentry and working on all home projects and i also use them when i paint."
4.0,"These r very comfty for my bf. He absolutely loves them! Unfortunately, we already have a couple holes in them due to pliers- not as sturdy as the harder material ones but more comfty. Quick delivery :)"
5.0,"36"" waist was right on.  Maybe 1/2"" smaller than some others at the start of the day.

Waist sits a little higher than I wanted, jams into stomach when you sit down a little, but since they're they only decent colored pants out there, I'm buying some more.  Fit looks good, even at the end of the day, compared to most jeans.  Very comfy, fits good but can still move around."
5.0,"Because of other's reviews of this product I had some difficulty choosing the right size. Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent. Keep in mind that if using these for work darker colors will be less prone to stains and dirt, however, even Carhartts in lighter colors clean up well."
5.0,"I really do like these jeans (Pants really)
They fit perfect and the leg pocket is the perfect size for my Blackberry.
For the money you cant go wrong."
5.0,I'll start by saying that the sizing is def. different than other brands. I was hesitant to purchase these online after reading the reviews about the sizing problems. I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week. The only problem I have noticed is that they seem to come out of the drier very wrinkled but it is not a big deal. Overall I would reccomend these pants.
5.0,"Carhartt jeans are high quality, and the loose-fit Carpenter model is a very good all-round choice. They are durable enough to wear while performing manual labour, and elegant enough to use at a formal occation."
1.0,"These are thin and not what I expected,more like slacks. I prefer the heavy duck type. My bad for this one. I'm sure they are of good quality if these are what your looking for."
4.0,"Great quality slacks, I love the fit, length, sturdiness, etc.  Too bad Carhartt changed the front leg velcro-ed pockets.  They used to be full cut velcro across the top -- easily to slip my mobile or a pad into.  Now the pocket is a weird slanted-3/4-cut velcro, and it's trickier to slip my mobile, etc into.  Maybe more resistant to being nicked, but I preferred the older style.  Still a terrific slack, and my favorite."
5.0,My husband is very happy with the comfort and practicality of these pants.  I am happy that they wash well and they look good on him.
5.0,"After brand jumping for years, I've settled on Carhartt for everything I wear. My only regret is that I don't live in a colder climate to wear their winter outdoor gear. This stuff is SUPER well made, and will last a long time, even on a farm."
5.0,"Once you know your size, getting them via Amazon is great.  These pants are durable and fit great."
5.0,I wear a size 38x34 in levis and the 38 carhartts fit me perfectly. These pants meet every single one of my expectations as a contractor that works on home repairs and maintenance all day long. I couldn't ask for anything more and the five pairs I own are all I ever wear to the job.
5.0,Excactly what I ordered. If you know your carhartt size already then you get what you order
4.0,Ok first off these run a size small(tight for loose fit). And yes they are the thinner fabric which is what I wanted. Other than the size thing I like them.
5.0,"Lightweight, durable, they fit well and are very comfortable. I can wear them all year. The side pocket fits a cell phone and the loops fit a paintbrush or hammer. If you are looking for the heavy-duty pants, get the 12 oz. duck with the double-knee. These are more the weight of jeans."
1.0,"Like the previous reviewer noted, these pants are several sizes smaller than what you'd expect.  Since they're not any sort of standard size, I have no idea what size I'd need to order.  Makes ordering clothes online impossible."
1.0,First-these pants do not even come close to the Carhartt's I have purchased in the past.  It really makes me wonder if they are real Carhartts.  Second the sizing is not even close!  If you take a 36 waist and you order a 36 be prepared to send them back.  Even though they will be marked as a 36 they will seem more like a 32 waist
5.0,"I have been shopping for a dress skeleton watch for some time and stumbled onto the EE Dorado. I'd not heard of this company before, so I checked their website (they are a long-established German watch manufacturer), so I took a chance. This watch is a BEAUTY! It's far and away the best looking ""skel"" I've found for the price, and if the almost $800 retail price is to be believed (MSRP on watches is highly inflated), then this watch is a steal. The only other watch I was considering was an Android with a metal bracelet (an entirely different look) and at almost twice the price. I did notice there is no country of manufacture shown anywhere on the watch or the packaging. Although this is a German company, it makes me wonder if they are making these in China or someplace overseas. I've got only a few complaints-the clasp is difficult to open/close and the gold hands can be difficult to see (no contrast with the gold mechanism and no illumination). However, I'm so mesmorized by the sheer elegence of this watch, I really don't mind. Beautiful wooden box, too! A real keeper that I'd highly recommend. The vendor was also very prompt with shipping-it even came insured."
5.0,"I looked for a good deal of time for a skeleton dress watch and I am truly happy I purchased the Dorado. After over 2 years of ownership it still looks great (actually the watch looks better in person than it looks in Amazon's pictures) and hasn't skipped a beat. I am always amazed at the number compliments I get when wearing it. This was my first watch with a deployment style buckle. It took a little while to get used to it, but now I think it's the only style of buckle I'd have on a watch. No more dropping the watch on the floor when trying to put it on and it also keeps the leather strap from wearing out at the buckle. The watch also comes with an impressive wood gift box. All things said I give the Dorado a 5 star recommendation for quality, value and good looks."
1.0,The watch is more of a dirty Chinese watch. I worked well for a day and hasn't worked after that. Don't know what to do with it. Paid an extra 4500/- ($80) for courier charges. Shame.
1.0,"The design, for real and not the picture shown here, is awkward and very embarrassing.  I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone, not even to my enemies."
2.0,hard to tell time with it you have to go where there is some light and tilt it around to see the time
5.0,"Pros:
I bought this watch as a gift for my father and he loved it. In terms of looks, the watch is probably one of the most amazing ones that I've ever seen; It's defiantly far better than any of the mechanical / skeleton watches currently on the market. I looked at hundreds, but this one caught my eye. It's the most ""skeletal"" of the watches, while still retaining elegance.
The picture does not do it justice, it is even nicer in person.
It is shipped in a nice box that has the watch presented on a holder when opened. It defiantly adds to the beauty of the watch.

Cons:
The second, minute, and hour hands can be a little bit hard to see, as it is gold on gold. Some people could have a hard time reading it.
As other people have mentioned, it is not as heavy as it looks.
It is a bit pricey.

Conclusion:
This watch is one that i would recommend buying. It is unlike many that I have seen and would make a great present or nice watch for yourself. It costs more than a lot of watches out there, but it's also a lot cooler than most. In reality the price is cheap compared to other high-end watches. If you're thinking about getting it, i would say go for it, you won't be sorry!"
5.0,"I liked it a lot, nice design and color. I loved the material they used on it. I think people should buy them."
5.0,"The details are amazing and the look is rich and impressive. The watch was quickly delivered and packed with care. It came with a nice box for storage. It is self-winding, just move your arm to keep it running."
3.0,"I really like this watch. It's an automatic, looks expensive, and definitely gets noticed. I gave it three stars, however, because it stopped working after about 5 months. I don't think anyone cares about the practicality of the watch, but once it stops working completely - rather than just running a few minutes slow - it gets to the point where you'll no longer where it. I really enjoyed the first 5 months though!"
1.0,"It works pretty good and it is quite exact, but... it is engraved on back of it, WATER RESISTANT 3 ATM, I got it for 5 min into the water no deeper than 50cm(children pool) and that was it. Thank you Erik Edelhausen."
5.0,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas as he has wanted a skeletal watch for quite sometime and he absolutely loves it! I did a lot of research on skeletal watches before deciding on this one as it was by far the best looking one. And it came out looking even better in person.

The few complaints people had such as the weight and the fact that 4 is written incorrectly as IIII were both accurate however they do not make the watch look any less fancy or cheaper. Everywhere we go he gets compliments and it works and looks fantastic so I don't see any negative things to say about it.

The company also got the watch here faster than the expected delivery date which was impressive considering I ordered it during the holiday season.

All in all a great product and if you're looking for a skeletal watch you can't go wrong with this one."
5.0,I got it as a gift to my husband and he enjoyed it very much. The watch is worthy and seems to be very luxury. He received so many comments for it.
2.0,"A watch is too light to be made of st. steel, or steel is too thin. Looks small in the hand. More remind an fake what original. 'One of fixative string-courses on a small strap appeared half torn. Impressed with a box of watch, looks like a box of expensive jewelry, but I still bought the watch and not a box ..."
2.0,"Not worth 198 bucks at all.  It is a pretty watch, I got a lot of compliments for it.  If you look closely at the watch the Roman numeral 4 is IIII rather then IV.  Seriously, how could you get that wrong!  That's a blatant mistake and devalues this watch completely for me.  Check out the photos on the site, every shot you CANNOT see the mistake b/c they KNOW its there and they do not want to show it.  Once you get it and you see it, its a huge disappointment. A watch that's SUPPOSEDLY 600-700 bucks should not have such errors."
5.0,"It Nice shopping experience. I got my watch faster then I expected, and it was nicely packaged. As for the watch itself, its a thing of beauty the first day I put it on and went out had nothing but good complements on the time piece. I'm happy with the shopping experience as well as the product"
4.0,"I gave this watch 4 stars out of 5 which is what it deserves even though I sent mine back.  This is a small watch.  As one reviewer said, some will like it, some won't.  One reviewer stated, ""the case is clunky.""  Not in my way of thinking.  I wish it was.

One reviewer from Moscow says, ""be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract (sic) attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!""  I'm not sure about the situation in Russia but I am inclined to believe that his fantasy is working overtime.  It is a beautiful watch.  I loved this watch and would have kept mine if it had been a larger size.  Because of the size it is definitely an understated watch.

People whine it's light weight, pointers are difficult to see...hey weight is no problem.  Do you want a droopy arm that is sore from a heavy watch?  If it weighed more you would then be complaining about your sore arm or the discomfort of a heavy watch wrapped around your wrist.  Those who complain about pointers difficult to see...again this is the nature of a skeleton watch.  You KNEW this when you ordered it if you looked at the picture and you wouldn't have ordered it if you didn't look at the picture.  The picture definitely has the ""WOW"" factor.

I admit I got carried way in the reviews and the photo of the watch and my imagination sailed away into the wild blue yonder.  Hey, 40mm is 40mm.  Even a 43mm watch is not big but it does show a presence to the wearer and is likely to get noticed.  Again, this is a 40mm watch.  It is a very beautiful watch and you can easily get mesmerized looking at the skeleton workings that are exposed on top and bottom.  If The Eric is reading this, maybe he will be moved to come out with a larger version which of course will up the price beyond the $200 mark."
4.0,"If your man or you're a man that likes showing off a nice watch that's for you. It's an eye catcher and shiny. Also it's very good quality and comes in a nice box, .. i know,... who cares about the box!
Well, it matters when you give it as a gift!
And if you throw the Bulky box as soon as you get it, you still have a textile glove that will protect it from scratches in your drawer.
I got it for my husband, and he loves it!... He usually likes them thinner, (this one is a little bit bulkier than his usual liking) but this is not for every day, so it's ok!
Good Deal!"
5.0,"The watch is great, works and gets noticed.  Could easily pass for a $1000 watch if it was a little heavier."
4.0,"Thanks for the watch. Description is fully consistent.
Watches run accurately. It is not clear from the producing country. Not convenient to fasten the strap. Too much light, on closer examination it is seen substandard treatment details. Watches are protected from moisture? In general, satisfied with the purchase.
  Grigory, Moscow."
4.0,"This is the sort of watch that will be noticed!
Some will love it, some will hate it and that is seen in these reviews.
Mixed reviews and for a good reason:

This is a beautiful watch, design is awesome, weight is somewhat light but it doesn't feel plastic and that's because it's stainless steel. Not heavy, like some reviewers mention but it i think that makes this watch very confortable exactly because of that.

At this price, i thought it was a good purchase, and i'm very happy with it.
Keeps good time, mine doesn't loose that many minutes as some said but this is not the kind of watch you look for accuracy, it's a fun watch to wear and in that case, it's very cool.
It's flashy, too much perhaps. I agree that this watch seems very ambitious since everyone will notice that golden ""thing"" in your wrist and it certainly seems like a expensive watch.

It has indeed a chinese movement so this is not that great jewerly many were saying it should be but it's not expensive and as such i think people are beeing a bit harsh when saying this is not a high quality piece. You get what you payed for: a fun, cheap enough watch that looks awesome. Design is above all other qualities with this watch but that's ok for the price and i can't find anything like it anywhere! That's great! :) It is unique and impressive!
You will not find another watch in this price range that looks like this. Compact and nice to look at, perfect for parties! ;)

Like our friend from Moscow says, be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!

Pointers are difficult to see in anything but good light but then again, you buy this watch for looks, not function. ;)
Not the easiest watch to wind because crown is too close to case but other than that, i have no complaints.
Nice to have in your collection unless you only like superior, non chinese watches.
Very happy with my purchase, seller was very fast in sending the watch and arrived in perfect condition. Like many said, the wooden box is a delight and i use it ( as manual describes ) to keep some of my unused watches."
4.0,"The Dorado watch by Eric Edelhausen looks beautiful. Truth be told, I bought the watch on looks alone. I wanted a big, flashy watch. I assumed (you know what they say about assuming) that all watches kept decent time. I got a big, beautiful, flashy watch. It's self winding, which is a very nice convenience. However, its timekeeping leaves something to be desired. It gains and loses minutes over the course of a week or so. The variance never seems to exceed +/- 5 mins, but if time is of the essence the watch isn't as dependable as it should be for its price. If you do a minute check once a week and make the small adjustment as needed, you'll have a real eye catcher. I'm very happy with my purchase. The ten seconds a week I spend correcting the time is far outweighed by the aesthetics of the watch and the fact that I'll never need to buy a battery for it."
4.0,"I bought this over the internet. So I was not prepared for what was coming at me. Better to buy watches in a store, or at least see them with your own eyes. Too big, too shiny, too ambigiuos - both in the nature of the watch manufacturer, and the time. On the side note,  I am afraid I might get robbed with this shiny thing on my hand. ( I live in Moscow) Considering all the minuses, it is an interesting prototype to have in your collection."
5.0,"This watch is as beautiful as it looked online (even moreso, as you can feel it's weight too!).

I have found it keeps great time (have not had to adjust it since I put it on)

Would buy again in a heartbeat"
5.0,"Actually I bought this watch for my wife, as her and myself are watch collectors. I have several skeleton watches, and she loves them. She told me that she wanted a skeleton watch, she also wanted an automatic watch. I went to searching since her birthday was coming up soon. Well I went ahead and showed her a pic of the Eric Edelhausen Dorado watch, she said oh I love it. Then I knew I was getting her the right watch. The watch arrived just a couple of days later, she was blown away by it. It is one of her favorite watches. Why do watch companys not make more skeleton watches for women ? I highly reccomend this watch to both men and women. Women now are wearing larger watches these days. My overall experience with Amazon was top notch. I would buy from them again if I see an item that I need. Thanks again, Amazon"
5.0,"I received this Dorado watch a little over a year ago and it is as stunning to look at today, as it was when I received it as a birthday gift. This is without a doubt the sharpest looking watch I have ever owned and I can't believe the number of compliments I get every time I wear it. I do have to admit that I am not easy on any of the watches I wear; yet this has held up beautifully. We recently purchased another one for our nephew and it was the number one hit gift item at his college graduation party. For good looks, terrific quality and a wonderful value, I recommend it highly. It also comes with a nice wood gift box."
3.0,"I saw the watch and base on the pictures , was very captivated by it. I personally own a BAUME MERCIER Capeland model and was expecting a awesome piece.  here's my thoughts:  I do agree with some reviews about the weight..it feels very light , like there is no substance to it...almost ""plasticky"".  For a retail of $798..I was expecting a heavier watch.
  Other reviews are correct about the time hands blending in with the background...IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE THE TIME.  buy this more for the look , because you will definitely have a hard time see the time hands.
  The packaging is nice with a nice box. The phamplets and manual are very simple, nothing special. No country of origins on anything it comes in. NONE, NADA, ZILCH.
  I actually contemplated sending it bsck because i was dissapointed at first, i decided to wear it for a few days so be sure.
  I found that IT IS VERY EYE CATCHING. people will ask you about it and if you need a conversation starter...this will work. I actually grew to like it and am keeping it. For $198 ( what I paid ) it's not too bad for a watch piece...i don't know if this will be an HEIRLOOM PIECE, i doubt it, but it is nice looking so for sentimental value it does have an appeal.
  It is now part of my wardrobe with my other watches. if you are looking for a skeleton watch, this is not too bad of a choice...it will do fine. If you are expecting too much...this may not be the watch for you.
  but $198 for this watch is fair.  I guess I will recommend it."
3.0,"Let me say that the service from the seller  was great, and very prompt...but to be honest I can't be as enthusiastic as other reviewers. The  packaging is beautiful --- but the watch is quite lightweight --- fine for some I guess - but I expected a more substantial piece. The case is clunky and not particularly aesthetic in design. But for the price? Well I guess what you pay for and for a couple of hundred bucks, I guess its OK... on the other hand I would have serious doubts as to the worth at the claimed RRP, sorry, and I certainly don't conssider it an ""heirloom watch"" Am I being harsh? I really don't think so"
5.0,"All my friends love it. It actually looks like high quality. It's a bit hard to tell the time sometimes since everything is gold, but you get used to it. My other watch is a Breitling B1 and I'm satisfied with this Dorado. It comes beautifully packaged too."
5.0,"The ""Dorado"" stands out and gets attention. Its design is breathtaking. Its quality and workmanship are unequaled in its class. Bravo!"
5.0,I got mine as birthday gift and it`s just amazing. The most bautiful watch I`ve ever seen. Everybody`s asking me about it. The selfwinding mechanism is just perfect. It lasts more that 15 hours. I LOVE IT!!!
5.0,"I searched for some time to buy a skeleton watch and a watch with all the clockworks (without battery)
it is the best deal that I found
the look is great near perfect, I wore it for 2 weeks now and it is really beautiful
just one small thing the balance wheel give only few hours of remaining power ( about 8-10 hours) so you have to wear it every day or to readjust the time each time that you want to wear it but it take only 5 seconds to do it so it is realy a detail"
4.0,"cute slip which is very comfortable and didn't irritate when i tried it on my daughter, doesnt have too much poof but just enough to flare out her dress"
5.0,"I already bought one of these and it is beautiful just like everyone described!  Soft, fluffy, and very full.  I even ironed it a little bit with very low heat.  When it arrived, I could not believe a whole slip would fit in that envelope...once you take it out, shake it, and hang it.  Perfect!!!!
Now I ordered one more for my older granddaughter...she will love it!!!  I did order a size larger so it will fir perfectly!!"
5.0,Absolutely adorable. Fit perfect under the dress!  Lifted the dress enough to give it a nice flow. It fit my 3 year old perfectly.
3.0,"It's been a long search for this type of slip for me as many department stores have discontinued them as they don't always sell consistently, I was pleased to purchase on Amazon"
5.0,"I was very happy with the petticoat.  It was full and softly fluffy, so it will be comfortable to wear. The adjustable straps will make it possible to wear a long time as my granddaughter grows.  I'm thankful such a product was available on Amazon because there were certainly none in the stores.  I like to make dresses as gifts to my granddaughter, so having a separate petticoat is necessary.  It is a very good product."
5.0,I read all the reviews for this item before I decided to place my order. I am glad I did because this item does run smaller. My grandaughter loved it.
5.0,"I ordered this for my almost 4 year old to wear under her flower girl dress. I looked at our local bridal shop but they didn't have any. I was nervous that this one would be too long but the length was perfect. The only thing was the one strap fell down all day, but that wasn't that big of a deal."
2.0,I followed the advice of previous reviews and purchased the slip a little larger.  The slip runs very small!  I had no problems with it at all.
5.0,This is a very nice slip.  My daughter's 3 yrs old and I bought her a size 4 to 6 because someone else said to buy a size bigger in their review.  I'm happy I listened to her because it does seem to run a bit small.  I also suggest going up to the higher size.
5.0,Bought this some time back for our little girl.  Bought a bigger size than needed and I would recommend that.  It really adds that nice touch to her sunday dresses and even just her no longer sunday dresses but now everyday dresses.
5.0,"Fit very well, soft texture and comfortable so our granddaughter enjoys dressing up for church. Exactly the right amount of ""fluff"", so it is not a runway petticoat. Washes and dries easily."
4.0,"I took the advice of others and bought an 8/10 for my 6yo daughter even though I felt like I would be seriously regretting it. It fits just fine. I have to pull the strap all the way to the shortest setting but she's fine in it. I haven't put it in the dryer on no heat to fluff it up yet, I look forwards to seeing how it does. As it is it's not super fluffy, see pictures.  Shes 21"" around the ribs and 26"" from the top of her shoulder to the top of her knee. Also, I don't know if the description says this, I didn't know it would have the option, but the straps can detach on the back side so that you can cross them in an X if you need to do so. I kind of thought it was odd that they wouldnt completely remove in case you needed sleeveless, but I suppose they would only get lost anyway :). For those wondering about shipping window, I ordered it on the 18th and received it on the 27th using Prime."
3.0,The petticoat fluffs out my daughter's dress perfectly but I was expecting the slip to be made of a thicker material on the top part. You could see through the dress and I was hoping the petticoat the top part would provide an extra layer. This does not because it's so thin on top. However the bottom part of the petticoat works perfectly fluffing out her dress and keeps it's shape.
5.0,super cute. not too puffy just enough to make your dress a little more fancy. daughter loves it.
5.0,Just what I needed for my granddaughter!
5.0,"My almost 3 yo granddaughter will wear it, which is miraculous in itself! Very soft and light - it's a ""Princess"" slip ;)"
1.0,Was not what I expected.
3.0,"I think the price was too much, but I had no choice as my daughter needed something for her flower girl dress.  It did the job but it was way too long in the chest area.  I actually wound up cutting off the straps and sewing it to the flower girl dress."
2.0,It looked fuller in the picture than it does in person.  I took it out of the package to let it sit out for a bit but I am just not convinced.  I took a chance and well...it just wasn't what I expected.  The shipper was great though.
5.0,"good petty and good price
bought this for my flower girls, they were so very beautiful i could die, ha"
5.0,"This ring is shiny and the stones have great color. I am wearing it as a thumb ring and it is very comfortable. My only negative would be that in one place the stone colors are not in order, they are clear, pink, clear, pink and then the colors are in order."
5.0,"I bought this ring for my mother for Christmas.  It is very beautiful, thin, and brightly colored.  I didn't know from the picture that the stones went around the whole ring but they do.  We just got the rind so I cannot say for sure if it will fade or if the stones will fall out but for the price it is definetly worth buying."
4.0,"The ring is really beautiful.  You can just mesmerize yourself twisting the ring around and seeing the different color gems around the ring.  But I have to caution.  The price is a steal, but beware of the $5 shipping rate.  Other than that I have no complaints."
5.0,I am pleased with the ring. Well worth the money. Arrived in a pretty gift box. The stones are beautiful bright colors.
5.0,"Love this multi-colored ring.  The silver is shiny and clean.  Stones are clear and perfectly cut and spaced.  This is a thinner ring and exactly what I was looking for.  I bought a size 9 and the fit is right. Don't hesitate - this ring looks great for the price, arrived remarkably quick from Gem Avenue and I've been very pleased."
4.0,"very pretty, very good price. it does fade a bit though, and now its much darker than when i got it (about 2 months ago). one stone fell out, but thats probably more my fault. definitly a good deal for your money."
5.0,"I ordered and received a beautiful eternity ring with many sparkly colors.  I like it a lot.  For even more effect, two rings would be good.  I love 'circle' rings that have color all around.  And these colors are very intense."
1.0,"This is such a pretty ring but the third time I wore it I lost a stone.  I didn't even feel like bothering to send it back, but it looks horrible and I can't wear it.  If I had the stone I could fix it but it somehow fell off while I was sitting watching TV and it's somewhere in my sofa.  I wouldn't spend the money on this ring."
5.0,"I am slightly OCD so in the summer when I wear rings with colors other than dark red and black I like to have a tie in.  It really will go with about anything, I love twisting it around on my finger to look at all the beautiful stones.  I love it, and I have worn it every day since I received it."
1.0,"I purchased this ring because it looked beautiful and the price was a steal.  Well, I knew it would be a piece of jewelry that would not last forever; however, my experience was ridiculous.  The day I received the ring it lost a stone.  Within a week 2 more stones fell out.  It has been about 3 weeks since I got it and I can't even wear it anymore because it's lost about 25% of its stones!  The shipping for return is not worth it."
5.0,I bought two of these for my daughter.  She loves it.  It's little for her little hands.  She loves that it's multicolored so she can pretty much wear it with anything.
3.0,"Update: After a few months of wearing it about 2 stones fell out.

I got this ring only a few days ago and it is already my favorite ring.  It is very colorful and catches the light really well to add a bit of sparkel.  It has flat sides so you can stack rings together."
5.0,"I haven't had it that long, and it's possible a stone will fall out, that's just the nature of this kind of setting.  But in the meantime, it's quite cute and just what I wanted.  I don't think I could be happier with it."
5.0,"Ring is very pretty, gemstones are all brilliant and show up very well, even though it is not a wide band. Can be worn all seasons with all colours.  It can be paired with other bands for a dazzling set."
5.0,"I have ordered 3 rings now. They are so very pretty. One for me, one for my daughter and one for my Aunt. These are high quality and really beautiful rings. I will be ordering more in the near future."
4.0,This ring is very pretty but awfully slim another words small.  Yet the stones are very vibrant!  For the money you can't beat it!!  You may want to size up a size on ring because it seems to run a little small too.  Since it's small I stacked it in with a couple of other rings and it looks good.  It's not really a ring people are going to notice.
5.0,"I really like this ring.  It is very slim but the stones are pretty.  Love the colors.  I purchased it for my pinky. It is the perfect size
for that finger."
1.0,"I was very disappointed the first time they sent me this product because the quality of the diamonds was horrible. Most of the diamonds had huge scratches in them, and a couple of them were completely crushed. Although nothing was wrong with the sterling silver hearts and the piece was heavy, I had to send it back for a replacement because of the diamonds. The piece they sent me as a replacement was much better, but many of the diamonds had noticable scratches on them. I will never purchase anything from them again because I believe their diamonds would be low quality like the jewelry they sent me."
5.0,I purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for Christmas.  They are very pretty and they loved them.  The quality is good for price.
5.0,"Great item, don't go looking for huge diamonds, but it looked good over all.  And my girlfriend loved it so I guess that's the most important thing."
3.0,"It's ok, but looks a little cheap (even though it is) and it's too big and heavy for what I was looking for.  I do not believe this costs $124.00 as retail price.  The diamonds are not even noticeable and do not shine at all."
5.0,Wing Collar Tux Shirt was reasonably priced yet high quality with black formal cuff links and studs in place making the ensemble ready to wear upon being taken from it's cellophane wrapping. The style is conservative and the wing collar is deep thus producing a good line for the bow tie. It was delivered amazingly fast in perfrect condition. I highly recommend this product.
2.0,"The sleeves were too short. The didn't even get up to his wrist. My husband is 5.9"" and he usually wears sleeve length 34/35. I thought i was sent a wrong size but we checked the size info at the neck, we saw 34/35 was written there as sleeve length. All his long sleeve dress shirts are 34/35 but this 34/35 was short."
2.0,"I have never had such horrible customer service in my life.  I ordered this through Amazon and they sent it to an outside supplier.  The outside supplier screwed up and offered a complete different item and then realized after sending the complete different item that they actually had it in stock. I asked them to cancel my order, which they didn't and as of last Thursday the 17th of February I got it anyway....a month after ordering it.
For my wedding.

Never again.

5.0,"My husband owns a number of tux shirts, and the bib on this one makes it unique. Do be aware that althought the cuffs can be worn with cuff links, they do not fold over like a traditional French cuff."
1.0,Company miss leads that was Italian made !!! It's made in China !! and had a hard time returning the shirt.
4.0,This tuxedo shirt was to be a backup for my pleated wing-collar shirt but I loved the textured look so much I switched to it. This shirt fit and looked absolutely great with my Tux and I will default to it next time. It was a great choice!
2.0,"Very nice shirt, but ran WAY too small no the neck.

Advertised size is a bit deceptive, too, since 1/2"" neck sizes are advertised, but not really available. I ordered an 18.5"", but received a 2XL, which also said 18""/18.5"". Had I ordered an 18, it would have been the same shirt.

An 18/18.5 normally is 18.5"" (just as a 34/35 sleeve length really means 35"").  Except this one was even smaller than 18"".  And that was before laundering. No way would it fit someone with an 18.5"" neck.

(Beware, too, that this shirt does not have French cuffs, which any formal shirt should really have, especially a wing collar one. I was aware of this when I ordered, so did not discount my review for that.)"
3.0,"We are using  this shirt as part of a stage outfit. In that role, it does fine. It's a nice shirt for that. If you inspect it closely, you'll see the stitching is poor. Also, have a pair of small scissors handy. There are dozens of loose thread ends.

I'm 5'11 190lbs 34"" waist.  Semi-sorta' athletic dad build.  I had to tailor 2.5 inches off each side of the torso. I took another 1.5"" out of the sleeve. If your wearing this under a vest you'll need to get fatter or get a tailor.

I really like the front. I have an anti-pleat thing going. Must've had A bad childhood experience."
5.0,"This shirt is very well made and will modernize your current tux look. I have worn 3 times in a month and it still looks new. I washed and ironed twice, but sent to the cleaners this time. Hope they don't ruin it!
I purchased a Large at first and had to return it for a Medium. I am usually a 16 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves for my 5' 7"" 170# frame. I found that the Medium shirt (15 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves) was still a little baggy from under the arms to the waist and little too big in the neck. It also ran a little long. I had it cut flat at the bottom to reduce length and the amount of shirt tail in my pants. Also had sides altered to fit me better. I guess that was about $15.
With Amazons' great return policy I was able to get a fit and a great tux shirt."
5.0,"The shirt looks great and is excellent quality. I get a lot of compliments. I am a Freemason and if I am getting a lot of compliments from several of the other brothers you know this is a terrific shirt,"
3.0,"well I was looking for a 17-36-37 or a large 36-37 but I receive a XL 36-37 the XL is a little big
also the buttons were different, would be nice to get a discount."
4.0,"Nice shirt, fits well and material is appropriate for a formal dress shirt."
5.0,love it.
5.0,Solid shirt for white tie events-launders well.
5.0,nice product for price.  I like its feel when I wear it to dance!  Comfy and cool too.
5.0,Nice crisp cotton tux shirt! Great price too
5.0,"For the price paid for this shirt its a real deal, try to find a Tuxedo shirt like this in retail stores or on line . a few little touch ups and you have a great shirt ."
4.0,"Great shirt and will be perfect for our intended use.  Fabric is thinner, so the guys will be wearing undershirts, but they look great. Fit is a bit roomier than needs to be, but still a good buy."
5.0,nice shirt
4.0,"I was definitely concerned about buying this shirt because of all of the negative reviews but I figured I would give it a shot anyway since it was priced at less than $14 in my size (171/2, 34-35) and there was an Amazon store that I could return it to if it didn't fit.  Well what a surprise when I got this shirt.  The neck and sleeve sizes fit exactly as expected.  The Pique Bib Front was uniform on both sides (the manuafacturer obviously fixed this issue after all of the bad reviews) and although the shirt is a little thinner than some of the other tuxedo shirts, its not as bad as it was described.  And I own plentry of tuxedo shirts so I have a point of reference.  It was a little big around the middle, even for me, hence the 4 star rating.  But a quick trip to the tailor shop should fix this.  Good shirt at a great price."
4.0,very nice quality so far...my husband hasn't worn it yet.  I did wash it and it looks good.
5.0,Very good quality
1.0,It doesn't fit well at all below any expectations
2.0,Shirt itself is too big and one of the black buttons was broken.  I plan on returning this item.
5.0,"Looks great, fits large. Would recommend sizing down .5 neck size"
5.0,"looked very nice, washed well"
5.0,I ordered this is a size that was too small. I returned it for a larger size. The return process was easy and painless and the new shirt fits beautifully. Very satisfied all the way around.
5.0,"Great shirt, I love it and will be ordering a backup one."
5.0,Great look at an amazing price!
5.0,Great for the price very good quality well made.
4.0,Needed it for a Mardi Gras ball and it fit well.  Order a size down because I had to return it and get a smaller neck size even though I ordered the same size I always do in other shirts
5.0,great shirt
5.0,Great shirt for the price.  Looks MUCH better than similarly priced tux shirts.
5.0,"well made, fine details including the pique bib! We are buying 2 more."
5.0,Really nice shirt. Fits me well and looks great.
1.0,"This shirt was rather thin, and it was so much larger than the stated size would indicate. It was kind of ridiculous, actually. So, it will have to go back!"
4.0,"The shirt fit great and I have wear a 46 coat, large chest and 36in waist.  My XL wouldnt probably fit the beer gut as I had one of those for a long time - if large chested.  The length of the shirt tail and extra button at bottom we excellent, something lower price shirts often do not have - wow -great addition.  This was a BIB tuxedo shirt and I had to laugh, I didn't know what bib meant until a little research told me it was the rave of the gangster era - looks like a lobster bib on from of shirt and what SHOULD be part of a tux shirt.
Great shirt for performing magic.  My only issue was I wanted a higher % cotton blend shirt but could not find unless I paid $125 or more - yikes!! so this shirt did not hold starch well which was the only drawback and would not matter to most folks wearing t his shirt.
I am a 26 coat,17.75 neck, xl shirt with a 46 chest, 36 waist and a 30in sleeve."
5.0,Worn at my wedding. Great look!
5.0,great quality
5.0,it was a gift and my friend love it
5.0,My husband enjoys this shirt and I like the nicer look of the fabric and tailoring.
4.0,"First off, I loved the quality of this shirt.  It is a beautiful, thick, (but not super thick) soft poly/cotton blend, with a really nice patterned front.  I'm a big guy, usually wearing a size 18.5 - 19 collar. (46 - 48 waist, and I'm only about 6 ft.)  Fearing, that this might run a little small, I went with a sized 20 collar with a 34/35 sleeve.  First off, I was super impressed and happy that this shirt was actually made in that size, so THANK YOU.  That said, the shirt seemed a bit bigger than expected and needed some tailoring to get it right.

In the neck area, I had a little room, making the shirt very comfortable.  Additionally, the sleeves were cut perfectly.  However, the rest of the shirt fit me kind of big and I had to have my tailor both cut the length of the shirt (probably about 3 or 4 inches!) and take the shirt in about 4 inches.  That said, I still ended up with a beautiful, high quality tux shirt, for a very good price.  I would definitely recommend this shirt!"
5.0,Fast shipping item as described good deal
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Good fit. Especially the neck size
5.0,I ordered the smallest size and it was still too large. Great design tho. This shirt is unique. 5 stars as a result of its design. but they need to reconsider their sizes.
4.0,"Not a bad shirt if you're trying to do white tie on the cheap. The sleeves were slightly short, and the shirt was very baggy (I had to get it taken in). I wore this for my wedding with a matching pique vest and bow tie. For the price, I couldn't have asked for more."
5.0,Shirt is nice.  But I didn't go with the winged shirt for my wedding.
1.0,Fits like a parachute. What a waste.
5.0,Handsome shirt. Good quality.
5.0,nice clothing great purchase
5.0,"very nice ,well made ,very happy"
5.0,Product excellent
3.0,Was a little larger than expected but neck size was OK. Poor finish. I had to spend 25 minutes cutting out strings and cleaning button holes. The neck button is coming out after first trial wear. I plan to get my needle and string out later when I get time.. I expected better for the price.
4.0,The shirt was excessively too big which was my fault. I ordered by the neck size and received a 4XL when I needed a 2XL. The quality of this shirt is excellent and the style is perfect for any formal event. I wish I had looked closer at the sizing.
3.0,I took the advise of other reviewers and bought 1 size up on the sleeve length. Good thing I did.
5.0,"Sleeves slightly longer than expected, but not by much. Arrived quickly and shirt is of good quality"
4.0,"A little bulky, but a nice shirt.  Did not have the black cuff links shown in the picture, but that's OK."
4.0,Fabric looks OK!
3.0,"I thought it will fit me,but the neck perfectly fits me though"
3.0,osjdosjdo
5.0,"Good quality,  shipped fast"
4.0,"The shirt is high quality and very attractive.  Nice material and texture.  I am glad that I followed the advice of one customer review, which suggested that you might want to order a longer than usual sleeve length.  I did that and it worked perfectly."
4.0,"fits well, good quality"
2.0,"I like the style, but the shirt has a low quality look to the fabric. I thought it looked like a t shirt. Unfortunately I missed the return window, or it would have gone back."
1.0,"the quality is terrible, the measures do not correspond. photo does not describe the article. I want a refund of my money"
4.0,Very nice shirt & stud combo
2.0,"This is a nice shirt, but the craftsmanship it's there.  The reviews all mentioned the sleeves were too short, so instead of getting 32/33 I got 34/35.  When I tried the shirt it fit well, the only problem is how the bib is not centered.  Probably not really noticeable to most, my girlfriend couldn't tell, but I noticed it immediately since something look crooked.  I even measured it with a tape measure, seem to seem, on both sides and there's up to 5/8th inch deviation.  Other than that it would be perfect.  As long as my jacket is on it won't be noticeable at all.  It's a good back up shirt.  In the picture the quarters are bordering the two seems, notice that the right side of the shirt is narrower that the left.  It looks like they tried to correct the error as they went down since the difference is less as you get to the bottom of the shirt."
5.0,Looks great!
3.0,too lARGE
1.0,I ordered a wing collar tuxedo shirt and that is what I received but this sport's wing collar was sewed strangely. I don't believe it was first quality; I think it is irregular.
5.0,thanks a million
1.0,Very bad quality...
1.0,"The collar is larger than expected compared to dress shirt 16"" collars. It gives the impression of a turtle or turkey neck sticking out from the shirt. There are not clear instructions for a return or exchange."
2.0,"I was disappointed to discover that the pique bib is no bib at all, but just a narrow strip of pique down the front of the shirt. I was not impressed, at all."
2.0,"just like everyone said... sleeves are about 1""-2"" shorter than size states.  Otherwise, its a really nice shirt"
2.0,The shirt is too large
5.0,EXCELLENT!!!!
2.0,"It is the size I've ever bought for my husband.
The shirt has very long and wide sleeves. I had to fix it."
5.0,Good quality shirt.  The fabric is not too thin.  The textured bib is nice and different from traditional pleats.
2.0,The buttons down the front of the shirt are not lined up with the holes. I had to remove two buttons and resew them to make it close correctly. Poor quality control.
3.0,"I read that this shirt runs small so i ordered a 36/37 for my 35"" length and it was still too short by a good inch.
Quality is fine and shirt looks nice and blend material reduces wrinkles.
Unfortunately I have to send it back.. sleeves way too short"
3.0,"Beautiful shirt but had to have the collar taken in by my tailor as was much too large, despite the fact that my neck measured 16"".  It is a good thing I had occasion to wear it once before the New Year's Eve Ball I was attending in Vienna so I could correct the situation or the outset of the evening could have been disastrous."
4.0,This shirt is as expected.
2.0,"Have you not been to the gym in the last half of your lifetime?  Are you what most people consider 'morbidly obese'?  Then great!  This  shirt is for you.  It's slightly larger than advertised collar size will give you plenty of room to swallow grotesque amounts of food.  And after consuming a horse and a half, this shirt will still not feel snug around the waistline.

Seriously though, what is it with dress shirts?  I'm not a stick by any means but there is an extra foot of fabric around the waistline.  Since I have a 36 waist, that means you would need a 48 waist for this to fit properly.  To top it off, all of the fabric that is not in the bib is completely see through.

Also, the collar runs slightly large.  I got an XL, which says it fits 17-17.5.  I wear a 17.5 collar slightly snug.  This collar is slightly loose.  Easily an 18."
3.0,"Quick ship, nice shirt but had to send to the tailor for some work.. I have a large neck but a smaller torso width, so getting the neck right is always my issue."
2.0,"Someone had written that the shirt was of good quality, it isn't."
3.0,"The website lists 16 and 16 1/2 as different shirt orders but actually the shirt is a 16 - 16 1/2 (""L"") which is more like a standard size 17.  I person who wears a 16 or 16 1/2 would be bettr off with the M size 15 - 15 1/2.  Sleeves are shorter than standard 34-35 is about a 33.  Amazon/Paragon is good about switching sizes or refunding so it is safe to buy here despite the weird sizing."
5.0,"Classic & Classy design. Wore it with a matching tie and vest. ""Handsome"" they called me!"
5.0,Love it
5.0,My husband looked nice in this shirt for my sister's wedding
1.0,"I should have listened to the other reviews and I am really upset. I bought it for a friend as a gift and it turned to be some how almost like short sleeve. Final word, do not fall for the 5 stars reviews and DO NOT BUY"
1.0,"Cheap material, too large"
1.0,"I have had many tux shirts,  so that make me know what quality should be and its related prices.

I returned this one ,  since the quality obviously not same as its photo at amazon website....
poorly made, if it is $10 dollars, then may be fit to see some never-have -such shirt guy
as long as you say $39.00 ( your magically riaised th eprice from $32 when it was ), at the moment it to be check out.

then turn out when it  in front my eye, better make price RMB39,  or below USD10.

my advice, to be good to your business,  do not switch left right hand  at amazon site, amazon.com is good site.

you waste my time 2 days for drive to retune, who pay my gasoline ?"
3.0,Somewhat large
4.0,This shirt is of amazing quality for the price.  The black studs and cufflinks pictured are plastic but the shirt really looked good with real accessories.  Shirt fit in the shoulders but neck and body were extremely large.
2.0,"The collar was correct but the sleeves are about three inches shorter than labeled. Either a mislabel or incorrect measurement, either way, poor quality control."
2.0,"I'm sorry I bought it. If you're looking for a *nice* shirt, keep looking.  It is a very lightweight shirt indeed.  I will wear it etc. but I wish I'd kept looking. Also, I missed the part about not having French cuffs.  Foolish me- I just sort of assumed a shirt pictured with cuff links would have them.  My own fault I guess."
3.0,"The shirt is cool.  The cuff isn't a French cuff, but you can rock cuff links on them.  The fabric is a bit thin though, so you're definitely gonna want to wear a shirt under it.  Other than that, the cut is really nice.  It doesn't have huge arm holes or flare around the torso.
It has more of a slim cut to it.  In my opinion though, it's over priced, but I'll keep it because returning it and finding another would be more of a hassle."
3.0,Beautiful shirt but the neck runs large.  Usually wear a 17 neck and it was at least and inch too big and made the tie look ridiculous.  Also the nice quilted fabric is only on the chest placket.  The rest of the shirt is a cheap cotton poplin.
1.0,"I ordered a Wing Collar Tuxedo Shirt with Pique Bib Front made by Neil Allyn in size 17 neck.  I already have one of these by Neil Allyn, like it, and wanted another as backup. What was delivered was a shirt made by a company called ""Classix"" in size 17 1/2 neck.  FIt is way too large, not a good fit like the Neil Allyn one I already had.  Not worth the  bother and expense of shipping the Classix one back.  This Classix shirt will be donated to the local thrift store. Buyer beware."
3.0,"Since it says convertible cufflinks i was expecting to receive the shirt with cufflinks but instead it came with regular buttons, the studs are completely black and not as shown in the picture, the shirt looks really good and it is a good deal for the money but keep in mind it will be a better idea to buy separate studs."
4.0,"Decent weight.  White t-shirt underneath does not show through.  I've started to need these shirts as a professional, so next time I will probably splurge for a higher quality shirt.  For the price, though, this is okay."
5.0,"This is such a soft shirt and it looks really sharp on.  The buttons are very elegant and the material is great, my husband looked wonderful in it."
5.0,Good quality shirt
5.0,As advertised.  Product arrived earlier than expected.  Looked even better in person than it appeared on the site.  Excellent Choice.
4.0,"After reading the other reviews I decided to go with the Adult size for my daughter (size 2). I am glad I did, I don't think the child's size would have been big enough. The adult size fit perfectly. She has worn them for two different occasions, but the toes have started to come apart, also one of the bows on the top came off (I used a safety pin to hold them both in place)other than that for the price it was well worth it."
3.0,The shoe covers were alright they just didn't fit my shoes. Also the bow in the left cover fell off in the first diver minutes.
5.0,I am a Halloween freak and I used it for a costume. Perfect ad to my costume collection.
1.0,Purchased shoe covers for part of halloween costume.  The bows on the shoe came off immediately the first time my granddaughter wore them.
1.0,"This was one of the worse things that I have bought from Amazon. The shoe size (even if you ordered different sizes, I reordered the bigger size thinking I bought the infant size) were the same size and did not fit my daughter's shoes. It was worthless. Also the bow fell off of one of the shoe covers. There is one star only because you have to choose a star or there would be none."
2.0,They would had been perfect if they were bigger. It was advertise to fit adult but it was for toddler
1.0,These are kids size not adult! Very disappointing
4.0,Cute idea but the listing should be more specific about sizing.
2.0,Cute but wayyyyyyyyyy too small
1.0,"The shoe covers I received were way too small. I think I might have received a child's pair because that's how small they were! Needless to say, I could not use them But I feel that if I could use them they would have been perfect. That is why I gave them one star, but based on the functionality and appearance, I would give them a four star."
1.0,"These would be great for a toddler.  I had ordered the child size and returned them to exchange for the adult size, which still would fit a toddler.  I didn't want to pay to ship them back a third time, so I ended up using these for hair bows for my 8 year old."
1.0,These were way too small for an adult. My daughter is a size 6 and couldn't wear them. We had to scramble for something else for her costume.
2.0,WAY TOO SMALL!!! Did not fit my granddaughters feet and it was made very flimsy I would not recommend this to someone-at all
2.0,"Very disappointing.  Did not stay on shoe well, cheaply made.  Sparkles kept falling off, bow was lopsided.  Just very disappointing.  Luckily it was only for a Halloween costume but even so not all it was cracked up to be."
1.0,"1st off, I took them out of the bag and one of the bows feel off immediately. I should have just thrown them out right then, but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Bad idea. THe one size fits all is complete crap. They sure as hell don't fit flats in a size 9. Don't waste your money on these. Piece. of. garbage."
5.0,The chain is exactly what I was looking for.  Excellent service and fast delivery.  I will definately use SabrinaSilver again.  Thank you so much.
5.0,Bought for my daughter a couple years ago. This has become her favorite chain. Can't beat the price.
5.0,This chain arrived quickly and it was exactly as described!  I love it!
5.0,Arrived exactly as pictured and described.  Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"Very silver and shiny, clips your tie to your shirt.  What can I say?"
5.0,"This tie clip is plain silver, and it functions well. I am a medical student, so I needed a professional-looking way to get my tie out of the way when I am examining patients, dealing with body fluids, etc. It matches with any tie, fits better across skinnier ties (but still works with wider ties), and seems to hold its shine well. Seems to be pretty sturdy and the clamp has small teeth to hold it in place. I'm very pleased with it and wear it every day."
5.0,"I was looking for a nice inexpensive tie clip to wear for some job interviews that I had.  In that respect this is a great product.  It has ample spring power to hold your tie down and looks good while doing so.  The only bad review of this product so far says that the silver plating is thin and may be wavy.  Mine is flawless in finish.  The plating might be thin (IO really cannot tell), but what do you expect for a sub $20 piece?  If you're worried about wearing through the silver, get a solid silver one and pay the pretty price tag.  If you just want something functional that looks great and works, look no further."
5.0,"this can add so much class to your out fit, I would really recomend this man"
5.0,It looks wonderful with my husband's ties! I am very happy with this product and would buy more off of this company!
1.0,"When a deal looks too good... well, just realize what you're getting for the money. The plating is wavy and very thin. The teeth on the clip are very sharp, and the whole clamp action is cheap and flimsy."
5.0,This is a great tie clasp for anyone on a tight budget who still wants to dress smart.  I was very impressed with the quality of the clip overall and would recommend to anyone.
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for and is exactly as described by the seller. It is a silver tie clasp. Period.
5.0,"I've been looking for a basic tie bar/clip for some time now. Stores these days just don't carry them unless you go to fancier ones and are prepared to spend +$50 for a piece of metal that's smaller than a pinky. For under $20 (including shipping) you can get this great looking tie clip that will be the finishing touch to your more formal attire. The clip is a lot shinier than what the picture looks like, so it really looks like it's sterling silver. It is 2.5 inches in length so it might be a bit long for skinny ties. Best thing is, no one will know how much you paid for it (that was my main concern). It also comes in a decent jewelery box."
4.0,"I wanted a simple, plain, handsome tie clip. It's easy to place and

grips just well enough to hold your tie in place in face of errant

tugs and pulls as well as in high winds but it doesn't clamp so

tight to mark or ruin one's more delicate ties made of materials

like silk, etc.

The silver and gold clips are both basic and normal tones that

you would want to go with everything of the like. Look them up.

Great for the price and people can't tell what you paid for the

clip--as they retain their shine. Worth the price ten fold."
5.0,I bought this product so many years ago that I don't even remember where -but I found it in my closet the other day and took out some severely tarnished sterling jewelry and followed the directions and it all looks like new now.  Especially good for rope and serpentine chains where those jewelry cloths just can't get into the nooks and crannies.  I think the bad reviewers must not have followed the directions -or used it for something other than silver.  I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to clean silver jewelry -nothing could be easier.
4.0,"The other key for me was to use more baking soda than recommended and use boiling water rather than just hot tap water. I also found it works better with a few items at a time rather than ""a whole sinkful."" Also, leave your badly tarnished items in there for awhile. For medium to lightly tarnished items, they'll gleam!"
1.0,Don't waste your money on this item.  Doesn't work.  Returning it is not even cost effective as it costs more to ship it than the refund.  Use MAAS to polish your silver.
2.0,"The product appeared as ordered. Washed and dried per instructions and the length shrunk dramatically. I'm 5'10"" and they are now 1"" below my waist. That's totally unacceptable for a major apparel manufacturer like Hanes. I have purchased this exact product previously without a problem, which is why I reordered."
4.0,fit perfect and most definitely will be back to purchase more and different items as well.  the size is perfect as well
3.0,"After watching Michael Jordon hustle Hanes tee shirts for a few years I decided to give them a try.  The neck does seem to hold its shape better than the Costco brand I have been wearing.  The shirt is much lighter weight than the Costco brand, about 33% lighter by weight and feels flimsey in comparison.  After three washing the shirt appears worn out.  The material is so thin the printed tag can be read from the back through the light weight material.  Some may prefer the light weight as it seems to dry more quickly during exercise."
5.0,I bought a few sets of the white 5 packs and black 4 packs.  Both are excellent and I especially like the lack of a tag (it is printed directly onto the shirt).
5.0,"Shirts came on time and are good. I really like these hanes shirts. Fit me well. Over time they do stretch a little but it's an undershirt so I don't care too much. I find that after a wash, they go back to size a little bit."
5.0,you can not go wrong with the classic cut and fine wearability! go for the quality of Hanes classic whit T's!
5.0,It's wonderful to be able to get these shirts shipped to you and at a good price. Will definitely purchase again :)
5.0,"This is a good product. I've had it for 3 weeks now. After the 1st wash it did shrink just a little. So if you are worried about the length afterwash, you can get it a little longer. But I am satisfied with the size I purchase. I am 6'2 212 pounds. I've washed them 3 more times and its kept its shape. I bought these specificially because the product stated it was longer. And that's something that I needed."
5.0,"Good quality, good price.  It's plain white t-shirts, what else is there to say?  If you are wearing a dress shirt, you should wear a t-shirt underneath.  I don't want to see your nipples or your chest hair through your shirt."
5.0,"My husband works as a maintenance engineer. He does a variety of work in several areas of his facility and so he needed a shirt that would be comfortable, stand up to the vigorous activity, and still hold its shape. My family has used Hanes since I can remember back to my grandfather when he was a milk hauler. So when we need a good T - Shirt I only buy Hanes."
5.0,"Sometimes you have to put on your Superman Shirt, and just get it done. I bought this for for one of my employees to help him get through those especially trying days and to let him know I appreciate his valiant efforts."
5.0,"Bouught this as a joke gift for my 27 year old son and he absolutely loved it.  He said it was the best gift he got, lol"
5.0,This is a perfect Superman t-shirt. The fabric is nice a hefty and the colors are great. It is an overall high-quality t-shirt. I washed and dried it last night and it still looks bright and did not shrink.
5.0,Everything was as promised. Thank you.
5.0,"It was perfect for my Clark Kent costume.  It fit well, and washes well without fading."
5.0,My husband loves it and it looks good on him!
1.0,"It says 100% cotton, it was not cotton at all but 100% lycra. My daughter is a 5 year old japanese girl, so we ordered a 5/6T, to try to order it larger than her. This item would tightly fit for a four year old. It was a weird, tight, reflective piece of clothing, and not the cotton t-shirt we paid for. A full two sizes too small and not the listed material.

And why on earth of all the things we ordered for christmas did this come last of all? We can see on the label it came directly from China to Japan in a plastic pouch (no box even). The items we ordered from America all got here sooner, some ordered as late as a week ago. They couldn't have got one more thing wrong it seems. As unsatisfied as a customer can get."
2.0,The shirt runs small and the superman logo is small for the shirt. Such a bummer for my superman fan.
5.0,Classic colors to go with a classic crest - nothing not to love.  It fits my 4 year old perfectly.
4.0,Good quality shirt for my 8 yr old son. He loves it
5.0,Nice shirt I just picked the wrong size
5.0,"Perfect size and fabric is good the print is also durable after I washed, thanks"
4.0,Super shirt at a super price!
5.0,"Fits perfectly. The blue isn't as dark the image portrays, but it's fine."
2.0,"The shirt is much smaller than it should be for extra large since I have many extra large shirts that fit perfectly this one is skin tight!
I am very sorry that I bought it!"
5.0,I bought this as a gift but they love it and they say it's a great shirt.
3.0,Bought as a youth large ended up with adult large
1.0,"Sizing on the site was very confusing and did not make sense, obviously I guessed wrong, it was huge."
1.0,Not satisfied
5.0,My son was very happy with this shirt
5.0,Great quality and came quickly!
5.0,This is exactly what I expected. The shirt fits true to size and looks great.
3.0,Quality and look A+ however the sizes run larger than the posted size chart.
5.0,Got this for a Halloween costume.  Great color and print on the shirt.
5.0,"Very True To Size .The S Is Vibrant And Not To Large Or Small, Also Perfectly Positioned."
5.0,Love it
3.0,Thought I was getting child's XL shirt and ended up with XL mens instead. Quality of shirt great just wish I had gotten right size.
3.0,"nice shirt and fortunately I can give it to someone else to use for their Halloween costume but I expected this to be a youth large and it will easily fit a grown man. Not complaining because I have another use for it but if I didn't, I would have had to return it."
5.0,My grandson loves it. Now he has a shirt just like Daddy !
5.0,My 3 year old son loves this shirt. The colors are vibrant and the logo seems like it'll last a long time.
4.0,nice novelty.
5.0,This is a quality product that fits well and the colors are as advertised. I am wearing it right now!
5.0,Good material. Classic.
5.0,Everything was as I expected. The shirt is a very good quality.
4.0,"Pro: Long wearing, color fast, quality screen
Con: Junior grew too fast

Recommended."
5.0,Beautiful I bought them for friends THEY LOVED THEM
5.0,"This made a great Christmas gift this year, my son was so happy to get a new Super hero's shirt."
3.0,"The quality of the shirt was exactly what you would expect from a cheap superman shirt. The ""s"" on the chest seems abnormally large though, which kind of turned me off to the shirt. Also the shirt was on the larger side compared to other shirts I have in he same size. Other than the size of the ""s"" I was rather please de with my purchase beings that I only needed it for Halloween night."
5.0,Was perfect for my superhero costume!  Great fit and good quality.
5.0,Love that shirt.
5.0,Arrived as expected. Bright colors. Well made
5.0,"Good quality, perfect fit."
5.0,I loved this shirt. Fit as expected and looks great. You will get lots of great comments on it. Definitely not a cheap t-shirt.
4.0,"my boyfriend usually wears a XXL, but he said this one was a little tight. the quality was great though and stood up fine after washing"
5.0,Nice shirt for the price.  We were the Superman family last year for Halloween.  My husband doesn't wear costumes so this shirt fit the bill!  The size is true and it help up after a couple of washes.
2.0,"What everyone else has said is true: these shirts shrink incredibly in the dryer. If you buy one for the man in your life, aim at least one size bigger if not two."
5.0,I bought this as a gift and it looks and feels great. I would defiantly recommend this shirt for any Marvel fan.
5.0,Bought this for my nephew.  It fit well and was of good quality.  He wore it for a gathering on the 4th and received many compliments.
5.0,"Have always wanted a Superman shirt but they are not readily available in my country. Absolutely delighted to have found one through Amazon's site. The color and size of the logo is perfect. The size i ordered (xxl) fits very well and i am a large-ish male.

I have worn it many times and it has not faded in the wash thus far.."
5.0,"Got the shirt in less than the expected time, no hassles! It was definitely worth the price I paid for it!"
2.0,no a good t shirt for what you pay you think you would get a better shirt.not a good deal
5.0,Perfect for a Superman shirt- I used mine for a Halloween costume. I might even buy another one in the future.
4.0,I bought this item to match a pair of p.j. bottoms.  His wife is Lunda Carter (Wonder Woman so she needed a Super Man.\y d\The t shirt was of heav duty material very nice.
2.0,The S on front is way to big  cant send it back i would lose most of the money i paid
5.0,I was very pleased to have made this purchase I love the product it's exactly as advertised in the site.
5.0,"My dad is my hero so when I came across the t-shirt, I knew it was perfect for him! He wears it all the time and when a crisis comes up at work he willl rip off his shirt and come to the rescue! Its perfect and it puts a big smile on his face!"
4.0,"My daughter decided at the last minute that I needed to be Superman for Halloween.  I'm not much of a costume guy, but we compromised.  I received my shirt exactly when promised.

The only fault I have with it is that the bottom hem started fraying and coming loose the first time I wore it.  It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it's definitely something the company needs to look into."
4.0,"The shirt is very high quality, and is authentic DC Comics. Bright color on the shirt and logo, I am sure it will fade and become a nice distressed look in time. Very happy."
5.0,"This is a good Superman T-shirt.  The material is heavy & appears to be a quality product.  The logo survived a washing (in warm, not hot water) perfectly well.  It looks and wears just fine.  The sizes do tend to run a bit small, so you'll probably want to order one size larger than you ordinarily would."
5.0,What can I say I've owned a Superman T-Shirt at just about every stage of my life and this one is the highest quality I LOVE it and the fact that it came in my size...You'd think that considering many of us comic book nerds are pretty big guys they would make more of these shirts in bigger sizes but oh well this was a coup for me. Highly Recommend this shirt to anyone who loves superman :-)
4.0,"Its a great quality shirt with a good quality print (not skimping on the ink!) but the symbol on it is VERY big. I wish it was smaller, it would be more iconic and accurate if it were in the center of the chest and smaller than stretching almost all the way across from armpit to armpit. Either way, I do enjoy wearing this shirt!"
4.0,"This was a purchase for my husband.  The colors are true to display on website.  The cut was full (I could have purchased down one size).
My husband was pleased with receiving it!"
4.0,"This turned out to be a great costume -- even better than I could have hoped for considering it was XL. Sometimes costume material can be sketchy and thin, but this was just fine. It also was a little longer than depicted in the picture, and it fit me great. Add some tights and a wig and you're all set!!"
5.0,Actually was better than expected. Was the best Magenta at the local Rocky Horror showing!
5.0,"Loved it I am a size 12-14 and this costume fit perfectly. Thanks to having the right costume I am highly excited to attend a huge Halloween party, and not afraid of judgement"
5.0,I simply loved this costume! It fit as expected and has a nice feel. The band for the cap seems durable and didn't get caught in my natural curly hair either! Always a plus! #CurlyHairProblems
3.0,"I'm 5'2"" and generally wear an xl in tops and bottoms pants are usually a 16 or 18 depending on brand. I carry more weight on the bottom half.
I fit in the top half fits mostly ok. the ""apron ties""  are loose and hang. I have a 38 DDD chest and they lay limp. So I will be reattaching them so it lays nice.
The bottom half fits OK but pulls a little.
The packaging says for the XL size it fits up to size 22. I don't think it would. It's stretchy but the slit might rip and you would probably look like you're in a maid sausage casing. I should also say I tried it on while wearing spanx and a corset. Chest measurement 45"", waist 37"" and hips 52""
My proportions are off for where the waist line hits. It's almost a drop waist on me. And its surprisingly short. I'm short so I figured it would be about knee length. Its easily 4"" above the knee. and then there is the slit- which is almost panty flashing. So I'm wearing a yoga boy shorts so I'm not flashing.
Costume is a kind of cheap but it will work. I wish I didn't spend nearly $50 on it- isn't worth the price. If I hadn't decided to throw a RHPS party in 10 days I probably would have looked elsewhere or asked a local seamstress to make a costume.
Oh and the hat is useless"
5.0,"Was too big for me being an XL, however, I didn't know that a standard was available to choose (was sold out anyway). Did receive the costume sewed incorrectly and the straps were twisted. Got lots of compliments though!"
4.0,Delivered as expected and in time for halloween
2.0,This product has very long shoulder straps. Will need to be pinned for my event. Entire thing needs to be ironed. Shoulder straps go along seam rather than proper placement of crease. Collar is awkwardly large
2.0,"Package was opened when it arrived. Someone had opened it, taken the costume out, wadded it up and crammed it back in the bag. I thought I was getting a brand new, unopened package. It makes me wonder if someone had worn it before."
2.0,"Way, way, way too short. It fit everywhere else, but it's definitely not made for a tall person. Don't waste time or money on it."
1.0,This was an incredibly poor quality product.  It looked terrible and I was too embarrassed by it to even actually wear it to the event I had purchased it for.  I would never recommend this item to anyone.
2.0,"These socks were inexpensive.  You get what you pay for.  Don't be a tightwad, and spend a little more.  They're socks, and socks are one of the most important and most taken for granted articles of clothing.  These are uninspiring.  I think wool, and I think warm.  These ain't warm.  They're thin and they stretch out easily.  wouldn't buy these again.  In fact, the whole catalog of the company was full of cheap, cheesy stuff."
1.0,"I was influenced by the positive reviews these socks received which inspired me to buy them.  What a mistake!  They feel cheap!  Seems like I could have bought them from the $99 cent store.  These socks are awful & I cannot recommend them.  I see no value or any great properties these socks are touted to possess.  They should have been advertised as a dress sock more than anything else.  They are thin & don't feel like a good quality Merino wool sock. I expected a bit thicker sock.  If you want a thin sock  buy them,  otherwise if you want a more substantial Merino Wool sock, check out QVC.  Will give them away to a needy person."
4.0,"These are nicely made merino wool socks.  The only thing about them that I don't like is that they fit too snugly around my calves - my calves are bigger that most people's.  Except for that minor complaint these are good socks at great price.

It's a little weird that these socks seem to be Elder brand but the description says ""brand not specified"""
5.0,These are mid weight merino wool sock and are great for spring wear outside. My feet do not sweat like in cotton blend socks.  They are soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Warm, and they're not ""quitters"" (that's Wisconsin for socks that sag down by your ankles by the end of the day). Great price, bought two packs should have bought four."
5.0,"Went for a 3 day hike in October. Ended up with wet feet. But these socks were great, they soaked up the water out of my boots as I was wearing them. Thick and comfortable."
3.0,they get holes in them too easily.  NOt as durable as WigWam (but a lot less money too)
5.0,"I recently was hired as a school crossing guard and found that it was time to order some warm socks.  These are a very good buy.  They are big ( I thought I was ordering a woman's size). As it turned out, the larger size is fine and I can put them in my dryer and not worry that they will shrink. They feel great and are very warm."
5.0,"I bought 3 packs of these socks last year and came back to buy more.  I've worn them alot and have yet to have a single one start to wear out.  They are warm enough for winter use, but wick well enough to wear them in the spring and fall.  I didn't try them in the summer though, the black/grey calf length socks would not look too hot with shorts on.

I suggest buying double what you think you'll need...somehow the family figures out how great they are and they start disapearing.  So, buy 2 packs for you...and 2 packs for them."
5.0,I got my shipment very quickly and my husband absolutely loves the socks. In fact this is my second Christmas buying them for him. I will probably do the same next year!
1.0,"Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless.

I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this."
1.0,"wish there was a 0 star

do you people know what assorted means - you are morrons - what the hell am I supposed to do with 3 red shawls and 6 black shawls- this is not what I bargained for I could give them to friends but I don't have 6 girl friends I want somebody to fix this  or I will never use or shop Amazon ever again

I have never been so unhappy with a purchase in my life

hope you have a merry Xmas - I am not"
4.0,"The product is lovely, don't get me wrong -- just be sure to note that you can -- and probably will -- get color duplication. I made the silly silly mistake to order two sets all at once (greater chance of getting all the colors, right?) Yeah . . . no. Out of the 20 I have, I have 3 red, and 11 black. Not faulting them, because they said it could happen, just FYI . . ."
5.0,I can't figure out how to contact the seller but I am really interested in purchasing an order of these pashminas.  I see that they are unavailable right now and was wondering if they would be again before the holidays.
4.0,These are very similar to the scarves we fell in love with in the London shops.  Great price.  I just received mine and I'm very happy with the shipment. I hope they wash up as well as the viscose scarves I bought in London.  I don't know why they wouldn't.  Soft and warm next to the skin.  Pretty colors.  I received 6 colors with only 2 of them repeated in 3 scarves each.  Thank you.  I'm going to order another set to keep for last minute gifts.
5.0,Perfect
4.0,"So cute and small. Gave them as a gift to a nurse. She loved them and so did everyone else. Hope it fits the baby, it's for up to 10lbs. I wish the material and quality was better, maybe thicker and softer."
5.0,A very beautiful scrub outfit .Super fast delivery of well packaged item !!! Would recommend!
5.0,Adorable!!!!!
5.0,great
4.0,"loved the cute scrubs. they came very quickly and packaged very nicely. i would recommend buying scrubs from this company over any of the others. my only complaint is that the white pen didn't write on the scrubs. other than that, we loved the product."
5.0,"This item was adorable, arrived in A-1 shape, wonderful people to deal with. I would buy again and again from them!"
3.0,"If you wanted this to look like a real afro, it doesn't.  But it was good for what I needed.  A lot of hair comes out when you primp it."
3.0,Wig came and it was in an envelope and I had to really pick it out. It is not as curly as the picture suggests. All in all it was a good wig for my outfit. I was cute!
1.0,I will never buy anything else from 7th avenue. they are crooks !!
5.0,Was a perfect fit and everyone loved it. I will be ordering another one for the next event.
5.0,"This wig made my costume!  It did not shed when I picked it out.  It looked like a natural afro.  I was extremely pleased with it, especially for the price!"
4.0,Fitted a little tighter than expected for about an hour then began to loosen up.
3.0,"I needed this for a quick halloween costume.  It worked fine, but it is thin and the hair falls out easily.  Great for a one-time deal."
3.0,"The wigs are cheap, they shed, but they were $6.  They do the job.  They're holding up well being constantly used by 5 year olds for a dance routine."
4.0,"These are great to use at parties, Halloween or joke gifts. The quality is pretty good and mine was packaged with care"
3.0,"The colour is very true to the computer picture.  It's nowhere near as big and round though.  I would say it's about half the volumn of hair shown in the picture.  Oh, and it stinks.  Smells like chemicals or something.

Aside from that, it's a green clown wig."
4.0,"For the price and the purpose I used it for, it was great! I did expect it to be a bigger fro from looking at the picture.  We were able to get it to stand up alittle bit taller but be careful that the hair don't fall out."
3.0,I got this for my 6 yr old and it was almost too small. Just be mindful that it doesn't have much elastic stretch to it if buying for adult.
5.0,"Wow this was better than non-costume wigs!! it fluffed out perfectly with a pick. Looked very natural. Wonderful for my 70's party, but I'm tempted to wear it party or not!!. Got it on time. Great dealing with this company."
5.0,"Wig really nice, very full and texture was great. I wore for a 70s party."
5.0,How soft it feeld
3.0,hard to shape after taking out of package and the hair immediately fell out
5.0,Fits fine
1.0,This wig has an awful texture I know its synthetic but this is too cheap looking plastic.
3.0,Cute but cheap quality good enough for my costume only
1.0,Definitely not whats pictured on the page!! Very disappointed!! Hated it and returned it
3.0,Cute just not voluminous enough I like big hair large afros like in the 70's.
1.0,Do not look like the picture.... More like a  Jerry curl
4.0,"It fits nicely, not too tight or too loose, and it's of nice quality. The curls extend a bit further in the photo than they do in actuality. Pulling on them just kind of made some parts longer and crazy looking. I bought it for a Bob Ross painting party and this definitely is not a Bob Ross size wig, more like Napoleon Dynamite."
4.0,cheap price cheap product but it did the job
5.0,I actually got this wig not to wear but for an art project I'm doing but it's a good product.
5.0,Jajaja the besto momento with the product
5.0,"Great product! Kids love to wear it, fits adults too.  Not too itchy either."
5.0,5 STARS! Best wig ever. Allowed me to embody the man I was born to be.
1.0,This wig is TERRIBLE AND ITCHY!!!! I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed with this item. It's an ugly ratty itchy wig that was a total waste of money. I work for a well known retail chain and this wig was part of the halloween items at my store. The reviews sounded like it was a cool wig to use for a 70's party I was going to. But it was a bad idea. Never again. I was so upset when I opened the box I laughed to see the same wig I had at work. After that I was irritated because I had a set idea in my mind of my outfit. I changed my original outfit to something else. After it's all done I will just buy one in person just to get just what I really want.
4.0,Loved it
5.0,Loved it and it look so natural
3.0,"Cheaply made and hair falls out pretty easy, but works for a basic costume."
5.0,"Purchased it for my husband and it was great!! He thought he was in his 20s again!! It does shed, but I used my fingers to style it versus a pick/comb to lessen the pulling!"
4.0,Good quality but too small for a man's head.
1.0,No volume and cheapy
5.0,One size fits most stayed snug all night and looked and felt great!
1.0,This is a clown wig refined
4.0,It really is a great fit and value!
3.0,kind of thin but works
5.0,I like it..wearing it to Halloween costume party  can't wait 
5.0,My 8-year old is wearing this wig for Halloween.  It fits perfectly and looks real.  She is adorable in her curly Afro.
5.0,Looks small when taken out of net. It stretches for perfect fit for me.  I have a small head.
3.0,Was fine for what I needed it for!
5.0,Nice wig for my 70's party!
4.0,I was very satisfied
5.0,"Good party gag, arrived on time.  Good for costume prop."
2.0,I'm not sure who decided this was an afro. This is a really curly pattern. Almost like a jerry curl. I was not pleased at all.
3.0,The fit is good I just thought it was bigger
1.0,"Brought the wig for a 70s party I'm going to. It's nothing like the picture, the picture the wig looks bigger but the wig that come in the mail was for a kid. Lucky for me my son needed one so it wasn't a big waste of money. They should really change the picture to something more realistic."
5.0,worked perfect ... we used it for a Foxy Brown Living Statue job. (painted it gold)
4.0,"I didn't realize it was for kids, it didn't work for what i needed it for but for a kids party it would do the job."
1.0,Sheddindg
5.0,Fits as expected
5.0,Everything is wonderful
5.0,It was  great fit but shedding alot
5.0,I bought it for my boyfriend and fit him really well staid in all night.
1.0,I don't like it at all
1.0,It's was very cheap. As soon as I touched it they hair started shading. I don't not recommend it for anyone
4.0,It came on time. It was just perfect for my 70's event. I will order again if needed.
1.0,Garbage!  Don't waste your money.
5.0,"Just as described, shipped fast, would buy again."
5.0,EXCELLENT FOR MY 70'S OUTFIT
5.0,"It's a wig...what more can I say.  Cheap, does it's job."
5.0,Good head fit.
4.0,Served its purpose for Halloween.
2.0,You have to pick it out.  But it works for my 6 year old son's play.
5.0,I can't believe this wig actually fit my head with all my hair.  Most wigs are way too small to hold my hair.  I got so many compliments!
5.0,Nice virbant color!
5.0,Good quality for the price.
4.0,Some of the hair falls out when they are combed by they are really affordable and good for costumes.
4.0,GreAt
5.0,Ok.
5.0,"As expected, Fit good."
4.0,This was a fun wig to wear for my 70s party outfit. The only downside is the hair comes loose quite easily. I found it all over in the car and the house.
4.0,nice wig ..sheds a little  but nice afro for a costume
3.0,"Don't be fooled by one of the reviewers with the photo. It does not look that good. I needed it for a Halloween costume, and for $6, it served its purpose. I wouldn't say I like it because I'm not using it as a wig which is why I gave 3 stars. Did the job. Would recommend for this purpose though."
5.0,Worked great. Got on the Jumbotron.
2.0,Was too fake looking.
5.0,"Perfect, fast ship"
2.0,You get what u pay for. Poor quality. The texture and look is horrible... the material falls out when trying to comb it out. Waste of money.
5.0,I love this wig! Got sooo many compliments! Thank you!
5.0,Great addition to outfit
3.0,"Not to bad, I was trying to shape it up and it lost a few strands of hair, but I was not bald with it"
3.0,It was crushed. For the priced and I was only going to use it once  it wa fine.
5.0,Perfect for a 1970s Michael Jackson costume!
5.0,Thanks
4.0,It fitted perfectly and the price was great!
5.0,It was a good fit
5.0,I used it for Halloween and it was perfect. Wasn't too unfordable and itchy but I also didn't wear it for longer than 2 hours so. It was exactly what i expected.
5.0,"Great Halloween costume. I would not recommend this for long term wear, but at this price, what does one expect?"
3.0,just ok for a 70 party
3.0,The wig looked great only downside was that it sheds at lot. You have ever to be very careful when touching it! But it served it purpose for the party!
5.0,Fit perfect. I will wear it again
5.0,was great
4.0,"it was great, but it sheds a lot."
4.0,i like it
5.0,"It was perfect, great quality!"
5.0,Great Afro wig!
2.0,"Fit finr but the quality not very good, look cheap"
4.0,For the Price you couldn't beat.  Wore to a birthday party theme 60's style.  Not bad at all
3.0,You get what you pay for.
5.0,"This Afro wig came right on time, I was surprised that it fit because I have a big head lol. The only down side is when I picked it out to add volume a lot of the hair came out. I still looked good and am overall happy with my purchase, it was psychedelic man!!!"
4.0,I love it is very good. I wear it every day.
4.0,good for the price
5.0,Great!! Just what I was expecting.
4.0,"Met my expectations. Shake it out and fluff with fingers at least 48 hrs in advance and it''s good to go. Do not pick with tool or overwork.

I gave a 4 star b/c the only issue is sizing: the skull cap is small and does not have a lot of elasticity. Therefore, does not fit well if you have more than shoulder length hair."
1.0,aside from being a little on the small side this wig had some bald spots and the hair didn't cover the elastic band around the forehead. This was a miss for me
2.0,TOO DARK. IT LOOKS TOO UGLY
4.0,"you pay for what you get,. for the purpose, worked fine, for those that have ""extra hair"" this is good as the band gives to allow extra room"
4.0,"Arrived in time for Halloween, needs to be fluffed quite a bit but did the job completing my costume to satisfaction."
5.0,it worked out well
5.0,Good for the price.
4.0,"I have a small head with hardly much hair and I thought it was going to be too big, but with the elastic bordering it, it fit just fine."
4.0,It rocks - for a super fun disco night!!!
1.0,To small
1.0,Not what I was hoping. Definitely not the volume I wanted. Got a different one that looked more feminine!
5.0,I love it!
5.0,"Sheds a bit, but great product for the money."
3.0,Right price for a short skit we did.
2.0,it does not have enough hair
4.0,"For the price, great fro wig.  Not as high as it looks in ad, but may expand after more picking. Looks very natural on me."
5.0,"Its a GREAT wig! The wig didn't smell and if you fluff it out, it looks fine."
4.0,"Fit but a little too curly, otherwise fit was fine."
4.0,Did not look as good as it looks in the photograph but pretty good for the low price.
3.0,I expected this to fit tight because I wear a very large hat size. I took a chance with the one size fits all. It was tight as I expected but it was workable. It doesn't pick out well and wasn't as thick as the pic above makes it appear.
3.0,He hair is coming out.....
5.0,was received as expected. Thank you.
2.0,"it's a cheap costume wig- sheds, and has a very visible hairline that I suppose you can pick some curls over to disguise. The curls are very tight. the wig is also really shiny and looks more like a bad perm than an afro.

For halloween or on a budget I suppose you could work with it- gently shake some powder into it to dull the shine and pick the curls out just a bit. Otherwise, spend a little more ($20) and get a better synthetic wig- this is junk."
5.0,very happy with product
2.0,The wig is too large because the electic is not completely around the wig.
4.0,"The wig will do just fine for what I need it for, but I did notice it does shed a bit. Also, while the description does indicate that the wig was black, I felt it was too dark, but that may just be on me. I just really liked how the wig looked in the picture better. Other than that, the wig fits like a glove and is good for its price."
5.0,I love it is very good
1.0,"We purchased this for Halloween, sadly it began falling apart the moment my son placed it on his head.
Wanted to return but missed the time period."
4.0,good
5.0,Look very good!
4.0,Once I picked it out..it was ok.
4.0,I like it a lot
5.0,Ok
4.0,Worn this unit to a 70's party was a hit everyone thought it was natural! !! Thanks!
4.0,Loved it! Picked it out and I looked very retro 70's. No complaints.
1.0,This wig looks nothing like its picture.  It is cheap but not worth the money.
5.0,Arrived on time - very good price and authentic looking!
2.0,Could've been more natural looking.
5.0,Its good for what I need it for
5.0,O love this afro thanks
1.0,"Time when tiok out package,hair started to fall. I had to comb it for an hour. It will be ok I guess for my 70s party. I would not recommend it! It looks nappy. I am a Black woman,but do not have nappy hair! It was awful in package. Nothing like package. I wish I could give it a minus 1"
3.0,Price and delivery great but it is not heat resistant as stated. if you put a  flat iron to it  melts immediately..  I wear wigs and weave and some synthetics are totally  heat manageable you can straighten the curl or curl  it...  don't like it. perhaps  the company can send me something like what  I need  not human but better quality synthetic... thanks .
4.0,It's kind of bigger than what the picture displays
5.0,i gave this product a five because this was exactly what i was looking for would recommend this to everyone
3.0,"They're thick and fit nicely but I've been having trouble keeping them up while I move around.
It's better to have a garter belt with them so that you don't have to fuss over them while you walk, after you sit down, etc.
If my legs were twiggier I might not have as much of a problem but the issue would still be there.
Nevertheless, they're good quality and well worth the amount I paid for them."
3.0,I am a bit shorter (5'2) so these thigh-high come up to just below my butt. The top of the socks is a bit tighter than other socks like them. Over all they are fine but if you are a tiny person like me you may want to look for these in the teens department.
3.0,"I bought these for my daughters Alice Madness halloween costume. She is 5'7"" and they came right above her knee. They are definately not one size fits all. I am going to have to look around for something else. Also  they are not very thick so the more you stretch them the more you can see thru them."
5.0,"Nice and thin, like a pair of stockings. Go all the way up past your knees. I originally wore them as part of my Wilma (Where's Waldo's girlfriend) costume for Halloween. But I wear them under jeans and with boots all the time!"
3.0,"I bought these to wear as part of my Halloween costume. I dressed up as a character named Wendy from the ""Where is Waldo"" books to match my boyfriend who dressed up as Waldo and my Pomeranian who was dressed as the dog. I received them in less than a week. They are very comfortable and they looked great on. I haven't worn them for any other occasion just yet but I hope that I""m able to incorporate them in another future Halloween costume."
5.0,"I needed this for my Wenda costume (Where's Waldo GF). They worked great with the costume. My only gripe was that they tended to roll down on me. I don't know if it was because I had them pulled up too high or what, but other than that they were awesome and looked great."
3.0,"I ordered these hoping they would be thicker tights like material, there was no real description on them, so I took the chance. They are thin like pantyhose. Not what I was looking for"
3.0,I bought these hose to wear with an elf costume I thought that they were just what I needed. After I wore them for about an hour they decided that they didn't want to stay up. If you have to wear them for very long I suggest that you think about something different or think of a way to keep them up one of the two.
5.0,USED FOR A FALL PROP
3.0,the color is darker than the color in the picture.
2.0,They ruin very fast! They don't last long. Wear it a couple of times and ready to toss.
5.0,"i use these for my stocking anarchy cosplay! i have very thick thighs and most other socks i have bought barely make it past my knee - and if they do, they fall down immediately. these stay up easier and fit!!!"
3.0,"Look just like the photo, very very stretchy. I'm 5'6 165lbs and they kept falling down :( but then they were up they were cute"
5.0,Excelente love it
4.0,Sexy
5.0,Wife loves them. Wears them all the time
3.0,for petite only
5.0,They were a big hit at our Christmas Parade!
5.0,these fit great! worked so well for my costume too.
4.0,good
5.0,"Stockings are exactly like the picture shows. Great product, fast delivery."
4.0,My thighs are large and this rolls down my thighs to my knee. I had to use a stocking garter belt to hold it up.
4.0,"I have only tried these on, and they fit well. I am 5'6""and around 120#. I don't have skinny legs. The stockings are stretchy, but I don't think they would fit someone who weighs 160# like the package says. I hope when I wear them that they don't fall down. Fingers crossed!"
5.0,Fit as expected and super cute. Thanks for the quick shipping!
4.0,"I am a small/medium but I will order the plus size next time to prevent these from rolling, they were too tight and it caused them to roll down."
3.0,ok
3.0,Material was a bit rough and they didn't really strech well. They kinda stretched themselves out after 1 use. Kinda sucky
5.0,"Every time I put them on the black top, keeps on rolling down on me!!! That's the only thing that keeps on happening, but I have been loving them on myself!!!"
5.0,I loved if
5.0,Great quality! would certainly purchase again!
3.0,"Top of the thigh is too small, it doesn't get much bigger than the knee measurement. (for reference, I have smaller-than-average thighs, but I am on the shorter side)"
5.0,SEXY!
5.0,Good stockings.
4.0,"Great product, highly recommend a garter belt though."
3.0,they are really cute but they are too long for my litttle legs and go right up to my crotch and make me look like i a have fat rolls above them badly.
1.0,"These are so thin I can almost see through them. The texture strange, like foam rubber, they're like hose.

Update: I wore these once and when  they came out of the wash there was a big run all the way up the front."
1.0,"My 6'5"" husband wore them for a costume party and they went several inches over the top of his knee. Worked for what we needed."
4.0,Cute & silly
5.0,"Daughter loves them , I don't know about the short dress she wears with them but all the girls love them"
5.0,Wonderful
5.0,Nice.
3.0,Product is fine exactly what you'd think. I ordered them for Halloween and thrust arrive til way after the date stated and then in the package it had a note saying refunds weren't possible because of the Halloween season I was irritated but I'll just save them for future Halloween costumes
5.0,"She said ""so cute"". Fit great."
4.0,Good socks!
1.0,Top band cuts into thighs really bad. Already have a run/tear after trying them on once.
5.0,wife loves them
5.0,"I love these stockings. I ended up buying them at OMGcon yesterday at the Anime redux panel and Im just absolutely in love. Soft feel, perfect fit, and great for cross players."
5.0,over a year later and still perfect condition!
4.0,"so fun and cute! fits great, they are thin and stretchy, so they work well as a sock or stocking."
4.0,These are really cute.
4.0,I'm 5'4.5 and they fit as expected. They looked like what the photo looks like. I'm 125 and they  fit me nicely.
4.0,"Look and fit pretty close to what i expected. They go about 7-8 inches above my knee (i'm only 5'). A little bit tight on my thigh, but my thighs are thick, so i expected them to fit tight. Not sure how well they are going to stay up, they feel like they are going to roll down, but they haven't rolled down yet (i've been wearing them about 10 minutes and only really been sitting here). i'll try to remember to report that after i've worn them longer. (Yeah, I found out they totally do roll down :-("
5.0,Love them
5.0,They were kind of small but after stretching them out a little they were great.
4.0,"if you are bit larger in size with your legs, then expect these to not go over your knees as expected. However, It still looked cute and did the job. :)"
5.0,Great
5.0,Love these tights..they are NOT like sock material they are NYLON STOCKINGS as stated! they come up beautifully and are great quality! was shipped here very fast! thank you and I recommend!
4.0,pinches a little at the top
5.0,"They fit a little tight, but I am also slightly overweight. They look and feel great, however."
4.0,"I wore these for Halloween without any issues. They are stockings, so there is the potential of them running. Luckily, I didn't have that issue."
3.0,Pany hose stye. Slighty see through and a bit tight around the top. Average but fun.
4.0,Perfect for our Christmas party!  Would order again
5.0,"Good quality for the price , fast shipping"
5.0,Too cute!
5.0,Wore them as part of my Halloween Costume. Worked out great!
5.0,I bought these for my sister and she absolutely loves them and I do too.  I think I want to buy a couple pairs for myself so the days I do drag.
3.0,"way too short. they were good in width, but the length is way too short. probably for someone thats 5'0"
4.0,"Great stocking for some holiday fun. I wore these with a Santa's Little Helper costume last Christmas. They fit well, I'm 5'11, and were a nice touch to the costume. Very cute and whimsical. Good quality."
5.0,Worked as expected.  No complaints!
5.0,They fit and are so cool
5.0,Good
4.0,These are great! I was worried that they would be too thick to wear in Florida this summer; but they're not! They fit pretty well but are a bit tight at the top of my thighs. Other than that they're perfect!
2.0,"Very disappointed in how light weight and small there things are. They were useless for a 5' 6"" woman and to low quality to interest her teenage daughter."
5.0,"Pretty good quality and thickness of product, colors true to pic and length and everything was also good for me."
4.0,"Timeless Black/White Stripe leggings, perfect with Jeans skirts Mini's and leather shorts. Trendy and fun to wear! Price is fair."
5.0,Love it. Not cheap material at all and it fits well. Goes well with my cat in the hat outfit for Read across America day.
5.0,"these are snug and awesome love this product, will let my friends is know because these are hot!@ this is awesome"
5.0,"these are so cute and you can wear these at any time, so if you want to wear anywhere you can"
4.0,"So, I just got this product today, the purple ones, in case it didn't state, and they definitely fit. They are only the TINIEST bit too tight, but I have fat thighs. And I can barely feel them, they aren't too tight! I am 135 pounds and 5'6. I would recommend this product, and want to buy more!"
3.0,"For a ""one size"" this fits reeeaally tight around the thigh. But then again maybe I'm just fat, oh well!"
3.0,"Even with the almost-circulation cutting tightness of the elastic band they kept trying to slip or roll down. If they were just a big longer or stretched out before use, maybe that would be more comfortable."
3.0,They fit me tight around the thighs around the legs its fine. If i roll them down it isn't much of a problem
4.0,"Although they're thin, they fit fine, stay up relatively well, and are pretty cute. I would recommend for people who like stockings for costumes or outfits, but just don't expect them to keep you warm."
5.0,Bought for my glam birthday party...perfect fit for the curvy girl! Would buy them again....price was right .  Yay for me
1.0,"I got these for Halloween (Waldo)... the description says ""thigh high"" but they came as whole tights. So I ended up cutting them into thigh highs and using a garter to hold them up. Threw them away immediately after the Halloween party."
4.0,"Loved the product,i'm tall so was a little apprehensive.
Fit great, did not fall down whilst walking in them either or whilst dancing."
3.0,Very cheap costume quality. It lasted for its intended use. One day at a Ren Fest. It is very delicate but the coloring was perfect.
3.0,"Basically just a gimmick set of socks. Cute and affordable. I'm guessing this isn't too much more than a costume-ish set of hosieries, so it'll be right up your alley if that's your goal."
5.0,I bought the purple striped ones. They look as shown. They are comfortable and do not rip. I washed and worn them three times. They also stay up well without being too tight.
5.0,"Good fabric quality, excellent fit, better than expected for the price. I recommend it and probably I will buy more of them."
3.0,Such a fun tight!  They will only last for 1-3 wearings - they were snagging on stuff and got pretty torn up.
1.0,"Cute colors but too tight around the thighs. If you have thin thighs, these might fit you. My thighs are squeezed to the point of uncomfortable.. I wear a size 8 in skinny jeans."
1.0,"Don't buy it because the thigh area is crazy too small. I am 5'4"" tall and weigh 108 lb. Definitely not recommended"
5.0,Great addition to our teenage mutant ninja turtle costumes. They fit well and were a good quality for the price.
1.0,"in the pic i choose they looked like full panty hose, i did not want thigh highs
i was not happy"
3.0,"Cute, buy be prepared to the constant roll down your leg unless you team these stockings with a garter. I would still purchase the item, unless I could find another alternative."
4.0,This is good much color with my daughter's Halloween costume for this year!! But this is lil bit long for her.
2.0,"The material didn't offer much stretch at all and barely made it up my leg before it became much too tight. Might fit better as demonstrated in the image on shorter-legged people or people with much skinnier legs... Instead though, I did find a friend I could give these too, and they fit on her quite alright as knee-socks. They just don't pass as thigh-highs however on most people."
4.0,These are awesome! Great quality and thick enough so I don't have to worry about getting a hole in them. I'm wearing them with my halloween costume.
4.0,"i like them a lot, they are super cute, and they fit well. but they are a little longer than they look i the picture, but over all, i really like them!"
5.0,They are a little tight on the top since her legs aren't really skinny so she can't pull them up as far as she would like but they still look great on her. She says they are very comfortable/.
4.0,"Me and my boyfriend saw these before and he thought they were really sexy so I bought them. I think they are comfortable but they don't completely stay up, but it is hard to find stockings of any kind that stay up well. Sometimes I wear them just to wear them. I like the colors. I actually was accidently given two pairs, so not complaining. It's handy when I'm having a hard time finding them."
5.0,"fit me well since I am small
they are comfy and good for warm weather
I use them to sleep in and they slide on the sheets real well- I have mobility issues so moving my legs in the bed is a big deal"
5.0,I love knee high socks but whats ever better is thigh high socks!  I plan to add this to my Christmas list.
4.0,I wore these to be a witch on halloween. They worked exactly as I would like. They fit just like most tights do and stayed up pretty well.
3.0,"I'm 5'7 and can nearly pull the stockings up to my mid-upper thigh. I'd like to wear these under a dress with knee high boots, but I don't know if it'll work considering that fabric just seems not too stretchy. If all else fails I suppose I can wear them for Halloween."
3.0,"They're cute, but waaaaay too tight on my thighs. I'm not overweight or anything, I'm 5' 6"" and 120 lbs, but these squeeze my thighs in an extremely unattractive way, and it starts to hurt after a while. So unless you're really thin, don't bother ordering these."
5.0,"Sexy and fun. Great product for the price. My wife had looked for these in stores, but they were expensive. Found these and she loves them"
5.0,"The socks came in a plastic wrap, inside was the amazing socks I expected.
I have socks to wear in fall now. Hoo-rah!!"
5.0,"These appear perfectly opaque on my legs, and they're cute as can be. However, if you are a heavier lady, they probably won't fit unless you're willing to wet-stretch them."
4.0,"they fit well. they are kinda tight on my upper thigh, so it doesn't look on me as I thought. but it is still a good product. I got the black/pink stripes and the pink looks orange under black light."
3.0,"I should have realized without having to actually buy them that my thicker-than-this-picture legs would not work with these.
You must have the thin legs that come with being a teenager which is probably appropriate for this style.  They are not stretchy.
Other than that the quality is good."
5.0,"comfortable and loose to wear, but do not fall off easily at all. I love wearing these as opposed to my normal thigh highs. I really recommend this because they're just so comfortable to wear."
5.0,I purchased these to go with a turquoise and pink outfit. I love them. They are fun to wear. Great price and I would purchase again!
5.0,"Have short legs so these can be a little long, otherwise they're great.  Bought them to go with a costume, but hope to be able to wear them casually."
4.0,its a good buy especially when its better priced here than elsewhere. cant complain with the quality. its nylons. diff colors to pick from.
5.0,My girl really likes these and hasn't had any problems wearing them.  Good quality and carefully packed.  Looking forward to next purchase.
3.0,They are fairly thing but they are not as high as pictured. for a 5 foot 6 woman they go just a little bit past the knee. but the price is better than any store you will find these at.
3.0,The top part of the stockings roll down however which is annoying because it starts to hurts if not fixed
4.0,"These stockings are cute, fun, whimsical, and sexy. a nice twist on a sure classic. only complaint is that the top is a little tight and rolls down."
3.0,A little too tight high up on the thighs. Very cute but not to be worn for long periods of time.
1.0,"I expected these to be fitted, but as a ""one size fits all"" product, I did not expect them to be so tight at the top. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs and the top of these squeezed into my thighs giving me muffin tops on my legs...not at all flattering. I bought them for myself and a few friends (all a little bigger than me) to wear with tutus and no one will be wearing them."
2.0,"Got a run in the side of it with my first time putting it on.  I don't see how either, it's not like it could have gotten snagged because I was wearing a short dress and I have nubs for finger nails; like seriously, I hate long nails and never let them grow past the skin on the tips of my fingers."
3.0,"These stockings say one size fits all and I am by no means a stick figure, but I'm not fat either and these fit nicely except at the top where they started to cut into me after a while. I understand they have to be a bit tight to stay up but after a night at a halloween party, they had rolled up at the top so that they were down below my knees and I had to fidget with them. I feel this is a common problem with this type of stocking though so I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying them based on that. So far they have held up quite well without ripping or tearing and they looked nice on."
5.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend. We both like it. It looks great on her, and she said it felt confortable."
3.0,"I got these a couple of months ago and have worn them maybe five or six times since and washed them each time. They held through pretty okay (which is a big deal because the washers and dryers at my school are brutal on clothes) however I was wearing them this week and the foot got snagged on a piece of furniture not even that bad and it tore a huge hole in the top. I'm very disappointed but I guess it adds character. These stockings are probably just better for costumes and if you want some actual striped socks to look for socks instead because these are more like tights.
On the plus side, they stay up really well."
1.0,These are not thick stockings at all - they are like tights. They are also too small for me; I am 5'10 and 200 lbs and pretty proportionate but I can't get these over my knees without them rolling down.
5.0,"I love how they stay up,and the colours are vibrante..they are a great part of my wardrobe now . :)"
5.0,Ordered these thigh-high stockings to go with a sexy Santa outfit that I bought for my wife for Christmas. Instead of stockings they sent me tights. I emailed the seller and they immediately sent me the correct product. Great service and cute stockings. Now if only I could get my wife to wear them...
4.0,Loud Neon Orange and black.. great for Halloween... I like this product. I will probably purchase this item in other colors.
4.0,"so I put them on new year's eve and just about cried as they kept rolling down to my knees!!!!
Luckily I remembered I had some matching red/black Garters from Fredrick's, I folded 1"" of the thigh highs over the top of the garters to secure them. I danced all night without another problem!"
3.0,"I am 5'7""  120 lbs, and they foll down my thighs. When they roll down they bulk up and create this tight band, it hurts! So they are too big, but that causes them to bunch up and become painful. They are very cute though, if they fit you properly."
1.0,Bought these for 125-130 pound average size teen girl.  Extremely tight and uncomfortable.  Tops began rolling down to top of knees just walking across the room.  I would not recommend purchase.
5.0,Love these so cute and came one time.  I am thinking about purchasing more of these stockings-maybe one in everyone color.
2.0,"I should have returned them because I never have worn them, or her. Well, I'll give them to someone who might like them."
4.0,"I bought these for a Halloween costume. They lasted all the way through the night and one more day of wear without getting one hole. They go high enough on the legs, but are pretty tight around the thighs."
3.0,"They only go a little bit above the knees. This is actually a nice quality stocking, its just too short."
3.0,"I'm 5'9 140lb and stockings were kind of tight, not unbearable just not flattering at the top. The label claims to fit 90-160 lb, however couldn't imagine wearing them if I weighted any more."
2.0,"I am a very small person -- size 0 in jeans, XS/S in most everything else, so when I saw that these were One Size, I was worried they'd be too big for me.  I ordered them because they were the only candy-cane thigh highs I could find which qualified for Amazon Prime, and I needed them fast.  I bought a red garter belt to wear with them under my elf outfit, and I thought they would be really sexy.

The length of these was perfect for me, and the fabric was nice and soft, but the fit around the top of the thigh highs was so tight I almost had to take them off.  They were tight enough to be a little painful, and I threw them out after one wear.  Definitely best to find something you can order in a scaled size, and stay away from these unless you weigh 50 pounds!  (I weigh 100)"
5.0,"Perfect for Alice in Wonderland costume or Cosplay.  Super comfy for what they are, (I'm 5'7"" 170) and easy to tposs in the washer"
4.0,Got this for an Alice costume and it worked great.  Unsure of how long they'll last but at the price I'm not really worried about it.
4.0,"I made this purchase to go with a rag doll costume, good quality/fit and could be used with any outfit."
4.0,"These stockings are very soft and comfy, but did develop a tear in the toes only after wearing them a few times. It may have been the shoes I wore, when I wear stockings, I usually wear them 8-12 hours at a time, so this may not be the same case for you!"
4.0,"Good quality tights, exactly what i expected. Stripes are a little small but very comfortable for price paid. Stays up and doesnt fall off."
4.0,They don't tell you that there are weighted sizes and they won't fit everyone. They fit well on a small person.
5.0,Good quality and good price. I bought it for my Alice costume and it suits well. The package arrived on time.
5.0,"This is a great company.  My order showed up on time, and it's good quality.  I had no problems with the leggings staying up."
5.0,I really liked these stockings because they are super cute and it shipped really fast. It went really well with my Alice in wonderland costume :)
4.0,I am very short and these fit perfectly up to my thigh. They kept rolling down but tights do that unless you have the whole bottom half covered. This was perfect for my alice costume and I love leg avenue.
4.0,"I used these black and white stockings for my American Mcgee's Alice costume. I wore them out for a couple of hours, where I walked around for most of the time. They were quite tight around my thighs, which at first was a bit uncomfortable, but then I got used to it and they were fine. I think the fact they are tight prevents them from falling down when you are walking around a lot. One thing though is that when I sat down they all of a sudden rolled down a bit, so I had to adjust them when I got up. The fabric was comfortable and not too warm, but they are opaque so you don't have to worry about them being see through. They are not perfect, but they served their purpose well and the price is great here on amazon.

PROS:
-Stayed up for hours of walking around.
-Comfortable fabric, not itchy or too warm.
-Opaque

CONS:
-Quite tight around upper legs, will possibly leave some marks.
-Roll down a bit if you sit down."
2.0,"I'm normally a size 2, so when I saw reviews from women who are larger sizes complaining about how tight these are, I dismissed it and assumed it would not apply to me. Unfortunately, it did. When I tried them on, I noticed immediately that they were uncomfortable at the top. I pulled them down to a smaller part of my thigh which helped, but they were still quite tight. I had planned to wear these with a Halloween costume all day at work, but I changed my mind because I did not think I would be able to tolerate them for more than about an hour. They are cute, but not comfortable."
4.0,"These were fine until the tops rolled down and they fell all the way down to my ankles. Might have been useful to have a garter belt to keep them up. Other than that, they are super cute and the material is thick enough that it won't snag easily. I would recommend these, but I would also recommend that if you do decide to get them, either have skinny thighs or buy a garter belt to keep them from falling down. :)"
5.0,Happily surprised--they fit perfectly.  Just the thing for my Halloween-going-to-be-a-witch costume.  I'm a medium and the size matches the label!
1.0,"""One size fits most""? Hardly. at 118 pounds I would think I'd fit right into the size range... no. No even close. They really need to size these as they do regular stockings/pantyhose. I can't get the top band around my thighs. I do not have crazy large thighs, and I've always worn thigh-highs, but these are ridiculous. Don't misunderstand, they look cute- up to the knees. Don't expect to wear them as shown in the picture unless you have the legs of the girls in the picture. SUPER disappointed."
3.0,"These stockings are really, really cute, but they are very tight at the thigh. I'm 5'8"" and I only weigh 140 pounds, but they squeezed the circulation out of my legs! Only models can wear these!"
5.0,"Though I would expect this to be a lil bit thicker, it is indeed a nice stocking and is comfortable to wear."
4.0,"These thigh high stockings are super cute, bordering on HOT! They are fun, stylish and comfortable. I would recommend these stockings."
5.0,Purchased for my granddaughter....she says she loves them.  Fits in with her EMO dress mode.  quality is great and fit is good.
5.0,"I bought these for my girlfriend and she looks damn sexy in them, I would totally buy them again! A+"
5.0,"They hypnotized me. I had to get them, and I'm glad I did. I wear stockings often, and these are great! Totally worth the price!"
4.0,"I'm 5'6"", and I found these stockings to come up to just the right height as seen in the stock photographs. I picked a very cute red/black pair, and it went great with my outfit. It was indeed rather tight at the very top, but I found it to become less bothersome as the day went on (I'm not sure whether they stretched out or I just became acclimated to them). They stayed on pretty nicely and securely, and did not find them rolling down. However, at the end of the day, they were still somewhat uncomfortable enough such that it was a relief to take them off. For me though, that's not too bad, and worth the cuteness~"
4.0,"As with most other stockings, thick legged girls may have trouble with these as ""one size"" works until the thigh. If you have big thighs like me, you may have to cut the tight bit at the top to allow your legs some breathing room. The product itself is okay, though the fabric is thin and obviously not the most durable. Just treat the stockings nicely and they shouldn't rip."
4.0,I ordered the Lemon yellow and Pink striped socks and they are great. I'm 5'8 and they came up mid-thigh. But unfortunaly they won't stay up. They roll themselves down after awhile of wearing them and they do make my thighs look a little chunky. I'm only 120 pounds and it does make me mildly self-conscious but I found wearing a cute garter belt with them keeps them up and makes my legs look nicer. :) For sure worth the purchase all and all.
4.0,"I just recieved the Leg Avenue Women's Nylon B/W Striped Stockings, One Size Fits All. They are exactly as described and I'm VERY happy with them. I just wanted to add a couple little extra notes:
--they came across as pretty opaque (90-95%) but I'm also so pale I'm almost see thru...so whether or not the white would stay 'white' on me was never an issue. I do wonder that anyone with a really dark skin tone, if there would be a subtle difference. I haven't got anyone handy at the moment to test that theory so I just thought I'd put it out there for others to mull it over. I also have skinny legs (calf is 15"" and above my knee is 17"") so they are not stretched much. But they are listed as stockings NOT tights, so I expected all this.
--I'm also 6 ft tall and 157 pounds and (with the aforementioned leg measurements) the stockings made it to 2 inches over my knees. They seemed to stay up for the test walk around the house...but the event I'm getting them for is not for a while so I can't say how long they'll stay up or if they stretch much.
So pretty much the only reason I took off one star was because they are hand wash. Not that that's going to stop me from putting them in a laundry bag on gentle cycle (I DON'T do hand wash!)  ;)"
3.0,"They are ""ok."" I got my order very fast but the actual product I didn't too much like.. They were too tight in some places and at the tops they kept rolling down!"
2.0,"Unfortunately, I'm big.  I have fat thighs and I know it.  But when something says ""one size fits most,"" I expect it not to cut off my circulation.  I understand, because of my size, that I would normally need garters for stockings, since stockings tend to bunch and roll down on me.  However, I have to wear these stockings just above my knees so they won't cut off my circulation.  I'm only a size 12, which is still in the ""average"" range, so why a ""one size fits most"" item won't fit an average-sized person is beyond me.  From now on, I'm buying stockings that have size categories that INCLUDE Queen sizes."
5.0,"These are really nice, thin material thigh highs. even though the material is thin the black and white are still very opaque ! they look so good!"
2.0,"If you have legs like in the image provided, you're good to go.  So, please disregard this message.  For you ladies with extra, beautiful, and luscious flesh, you have two choices.  One, don't bother.  These stockings will only reach your mid thigh and then promptly begin to roll back down.  Or two: make the best of it.  You're cute regardless."
4.0,"Excellent quality, exactly as described. However, I think you need to be at least 5'4"" to make these look right. My wife is 5'2"" and they go ALL THE WAY UP. If that's what you want, enjoy ;) But, if you're looking for that mid-thigh thing, these won't work."
4.0,"I bought these for my wife and they are a little short. She is 6' tall so I always worry about buying her things like this. The colors and material are nice. They go just over her knee.

She is a normal sized person, not skinny and not overweight. I won't put her weight on here because I am sure that would get me in trouble, but her BMI is 22.

These might go thigh high if you were shorter."
3.0,"Looked so cute for St. Patrick's Day. Yes the tights didn't slip off, but thats because they were way too tight on the top. I was only able to wear them for 1/2 a day before it got so uncomfortable that I had to take them off."
2.0,"I ordered these not too long ago and received my order and they were green and black not white and black like what I wanted. They don't really stay up well, they tend to want to roll up and sit at the knee. I suppose for that use they are fine. Not what I was looking for but maybe someone else. I was really pissed they sent me the wrong color, I emailed the seller BEFORE the order was shipped and to this day several weeks later I have received no response from the seller. I will not order from them again."
3.0,"These stockings were ok for the first few times that I wore them, but then began to wear and not stay up as well.  They are cute, but probably wouldn't buy again."
5.0,"I got these stockings for my 18 year old daughter. She loved them. The color was exactly as pictured. You can wear theses as knee highs or thigh highs. They are so cute. You just have to be careful not to tear them because they are a little thin, but thicker than pantyhose material."
5.0,"Theses are light and fit great i,m 5 ft. 3 and they fit as shown. I love these because they don,t make your feet or legs to hot.i bought 2 to 3 of most colors.
I,ll will buy more.also they arived very quickly and well packaged."
5.0,"Arrived quickly and as pictured.  The material is thin but for the price is reasonable.  My legs are on the thin side and so these socks aren't tight but the elastic at the top keeps them from falling down since my thighs are normal sized. If you have super thin legs & thighs then they may be a little loose.  The first pair that came had a hole in one of the socks but when I contacted the seller, they promptly responded and sent me a replacement pair.  It would have been better if there were no holes in the first place but the response was quick and easy.  Thanks! will buy again"
5.0,"Perfect for my Anarchy Stocking cosplay. The color is exactly what I was looking for, not to mention the style."
1.0,"They were black & white, not red & white. I am highly disappointed. My Halloween costume was supposed to be Where's Waldo, and now I'm just a bank robber."
5.0,I received these very quickly & realized that they were the wrong size. The company was very helpful & sent me the correct size. Love them!
4.0,"Our oldest Son loved these shoes.  He wore them until they were full of holes and rips and the sole was half gone (or gone in places) and he still wore them.  As a parent though I would have wished for a more solid, supportive shoe, but that wouldn't be ""cool""."
5.0,love them fast shipping great price
5.0,These are cheap and great shoes. They come with great style and good quality. Highly recommend.
5.0,Super cute!!!

My go to shoes for most casual occasions."
5.0,So awesome to get the perfect shoes so quickly! I also had to return the first pair and it was so simple and easy! I had the correct size before I knew it! Thank you :)
5.0,Love these shoes. Had the original B&W in High School.
5.0,Love them! Took a few weeks to get them.
2.0,The color was off. It wasn't pewter--more like brown checkered. I know this because I then went to an actual Van's store and bought the same shoes which looked like the color in the photo.
4.0,"I would give 5 stars because my husband LOVES these, but the color was off. They had solid white rubber around the bottoms, but all of the other ""white"" parts of the shoe look more like a vintage off-white. Other than that, they're perfect."
5.0,Perfect gift! They look fantastic. Exactly what I was looking for
4.0,I wear these all day and they are comfy but they get destroyed easily.
3.0,They are a little heavy. But I think thats how Vans are. Nice shoes!
5.0,Very nice and easy to put on and take off.

5.0,A+++++++++++
5.0,"My standard Bicycle, air travel, going to jail shoes"
5.0,Just as described.
5.0,Love these!
4.0,Shoes are a good fit. If Vans keep going up in price will be looking elsewhere for shoes.
5.0,Grandson loves the shoes! Just wish they were a little cheaper. Other grandson got a camo pair at mall for same price......but I didn't have to go to mall!
5.0,"The shoe was great
 They were too big was the only problem"

1.0,too small. sent back.
5.0,I love these vans! I cant stop wearing them. 10/10 reccomend.
4.0,gift
4.0,"They take a long time to get comfortable. I had blisters the first couple of times I wore them, but they are worn in now, and pretty comfortable. I will say that they have absolutely no traction on the bottom, as I almost slipped on the wet pavement a couple of times while wearing these."
5.0,"perfect size, fit and color"
5.0,"daughter loved them, correct size, color, fit"
5.0,Love
5.0,"Just right, as always."
2.0,Ordered my size and to small
5.0,"These are fantastic looking, classic Vans. I ordered the grey/black checkerboard for my 10-year-old and he loves them.

He wears a 6 in Adidas shoes but he needed a 6.5 in these (and may even have been able to get away with a 7.) Size up at least half a size."
5.0,i have had a few of these.  always good
5.0,Great shoes I have worn these for 30 years
5.0,Just regular Vans. Ordered the wrong size so I had to return but all good.
5.0,Like the shoes
5.0,handsome shoes!
5.0,Great shoes!
5.0,"Love these shoes. The fabric is black denim so they're more interesting than solid black. And Im not a white sole girl, so the tan rubber sole looks better on me and goes with more of my clothes."
5.0,"Perfect fit, received when expected"
5.0,"Well made, fun shoes! These are very comfy and fit true to size. I wear a 12 and, without socks these are a tad big. With a pair of socks  perfect fit! I owned a pair of these (black/white checker pattern) for many years and they held up well. I look forward to getting a lot of use from this pair as well!"
5.0,Excellent product. I have no complaints about the seller.
5.0,Fit and look good
5.0,Fits great would cant go wrong with vans.
1.0,"Worn out wasily, just get converse. "
5.0,Nice shoes...wrong color!
4.0,"Appeared to be good quality. Shoes seemed too small for the size that was ordered,  Had to return."
5.0,Brought these for my son for christmas. He loves these shoes so much that he wants the same shoes every year. I believe this is his 5 pair.
4.0,"great, trendy shoes. very satisfied."
5.0,"Fits great, looks great.
P.S. they're dusty in the pictures, they didn't come like this."
5.0,Very nice shoe and seller. Happy with purchase.
5.0,PERFECT!!!
5.0,"Didn't think I'd be into slip-ons, but I love these! I wear them almost everyday. I did wear them everyday for a week while I was traveling, and no ill comforts. Definitely my go-to shoes."
5.0,"I wear these shoes almost everyday and they still look great. They are easy, durable, low profile, and the work great. I will totally be purchasing more pairs in the future."
5.0,White socks + beige pants and you're keepin it 100 if you're 17-30yr
5.0,"Delivered on time, great price. Fit perfect"
4.0,Vans are exactly as described. The same as the ones you buy in stores. Fit and look great!
4.0,"Somewhat hard to get foot into the shoe, even when using a thin sock, as the shoe does not have much stretch on the sides. Shoe fits okay once foot is in shoe, and I wear them all the time."
5.0,Best shoes EVER!! Super comfy and look great!
5.0,My fiance loved it
2.0,"Don't know what happened, I ordered 10.5 I got 11.5? I returned and ordered again, hopefully, this time they'll be the right size."
5.0,Very happy with the shoes.....
2.0,"I've purchased these shoes before with good success, they lasted about a year before there was very visible wear and tear. However I purchased a recent pair back in Sept (2017), that December the fabric started to tear around the elastic on the left side of the right shoe.

I contacted the seller (Gbrandshop) about a warranty/refund but they sent me to Vans for that. Vans shut the case down outright, stating they only warranty shoes bought through their authorized resellers, I was asked to handle it through the Amazon shop. Back to Gbrandshop, they never responded to another email after the initial finger point.

I contacted Amazon and got the refund handled through their A-Z policy, Amazon is the clear winner in customer service here. Disappointed with Vans' customer service on this, the quality of their shoes (hopefully it was just a bad run), and especially the customer service of Gbrandshop"
2.0,"Fit is too small in the width. I feel I have to wear very thin socks. I feel because they try to make this shoe Unisex, it will be uncomfortable for men, and I do not even have very wide feet."
5.0,fits.  correct standard sizing.
4.0,"I was surprised that these fit a bit snug. My normal shoe size is 8.5, but with slip ons or boots, I'm almost always an 8 or sometimes even 7.5. I ordered 8.5 thinking I was probably going to large, but as it turns out, I could probably have used a 9.

Other than that, they are exactly what I expected them to be, and have the classic Vans look I wanted."
5.0,Great shoe. Super popular.
5.0,"Nice color, fits as I expected (fits small). Quite comfortable."
5.0,Thanks! Everything was perfect.
5.0,My son loves these. His go to pair for sure.
1.0,"I've warn a lot of vans in my time, but these were way too small. Returned, but had to pay for shipping so I got almost half of what I paid. Sucks. Just go to your local vans store to avoid the hassle."
5.0,Excelente
5.0,Awesome shoes.
5.0,Love them
5.0,Exactly what my girlfriend was looking for and they fit perfectly.
4.0,"These shoes were just as I remembered from the 80s. However, they do run fairly narrow, and didn't fit my son. If you have wide feet, try a larger size or maybe steer clear."
5.0,"better price than directly from the company, love my vans!"
5.0,LOVE. I wear them all the time!
5.0,Great shoes! I like the grey color. Comfortable!
5.0,These are amazing.
3.0,order a size over your original fit
5.0,I got these for my boyfriend as an early Christmas  present. They fit him perfectly and they're so stylish. Thank you! ^~^
5.0,Very  nice as expected! love them!
5.0,I needed new ones because my old ones got super dirty! I am a womens 6 & bought 4.5! Fits perfectly w/ socks!
5.0,Clean and comfortable! Shipping box was a little banged up but product was good.
2.0,"I bought a pair of these for my son in June, size 12, about 2 months ago I noticed the side of each shoe is separating from the sole, where the little toe is. So he got about 4 months of service from theme. I am buying 2 more pair direct from Vans so if the rip, I can send them back. I am also buying in a larger size.."
1.0,This is the smallest men's 9 on earth.
5.0,Perfecto!!!
5.0,Super comfortable durable shoe. I have worn them a couple of times a week for over a year and they still look great.
4.0,Vans have no arch support at all. Good grief.  Run out immediately and get something for that! Ouch!
5.0,Love these! Perfect!
4.0,Bought these as a gift and they wear them every day.
5.0,"They fit like a glove! Price was right, don't hesitate get em."
3.0,"My son really really likes Van's slip on shoes. He says they are comfortable and he wears them daily. The problem is he manages to put holes in them so I wonder is he just rough with shoes or is it the quality of the shoes? He always asks to replace them with the same exact style, just in a different color. He doesn't like wearing anything else. Maybe he just doesn't want to mess with laces? I have a love/hate relationship with these shoes, but I keep buying them otherwise my son will keep wearing the ragged looking ones with holes!"
3.0,Got same size as I already had one shoe is tight
4.0,Gotta love some vans. These fit as expected and are great for a quick trip to the store or a night on the town! At this price point i will be getting more of these :)
5.0,"Perfect fit I love them, don't even have to be broken in"
4.0,Loved it
5.0,"Comfortable, easy to wear. Versatile. Recommend."
4.0,"Great shoe, but too narrow and small for my foot. I am an 11 I think a 12 may have worked."
5.0,Fit is spot on. I feel like Im a 17 year old skate punk again. A++
5.0,Fit well
5.0,"I was worried at first about sizing and all that, since this is my first Vans purchase but I was relieved when they got here! I am usually in between a size 8.5 and 9 and I got a 9 and it's the perfect fit! Might want to get a little bigger if you plan on wearing them with socks, but I just wear the no show socks and they are perfect for that! I love the color white and would totally buy this again."
5.0,Classic vans.
5.0,So comfortable!!! My go to shoes for casual fun
3.0,"Left shoe was too small, right shoe was just right. Not sure if there is something wrong with my feet or not."
5.0,Awesome perfect fitting vans as always!!
3.0,These run small and Ive needed to stretch mine but otherwise fine.
3.0,Too small
5.0,Perfect in every way.
5.0,Great shoe they do the job needed of walking..
5.0,I love my Vans!! So comfortable and I love that they're all black.
4.0,"I love Vans! However, it seems to me that the sizes are slightly different depending on where they're made. Maybe I'm crazy but the size 7 Vans I have that were made in China fit great but the size 7 Vans I bought that were made in Vietnam are about a quarter of an inch smaller. So weird!  I took photos to compare."
5.0,"mine run just a bit too small, but just need to break them in (: i missed having clean white shoes. plus great price"
5.0,Amazon always has the right size and color that my kids want! Shoes are authentic Vans and they last my teens at least 6 months which is very good.
4.0,"They were delivered faster than i thought. They fit as expected  for a unisex slip on.
I would by them again."
5.0,Vans are the best and this pair is exactly what I expected. No different than any other pair of Vans.
5.0,those shoes are awesome.
5.0,Always a great look and a comfortable fit.
5.0,nice deal
4.0,"Nice design pattern, Comfortable. The best for teens."
5.0,This was on my son's birthday wish list.  Vans is his go-to shoe because of its consistent quality and appealing design.  The Black/Black is especially  nice (and practical).
4.0,Awesome shoe fit is incredible and comfort like only Vans can give.  Highly recomend
5.0,Love slip on Vans!!
5.0,"Love these shoes , came earlier than I expected very stylish . Only thing is is that I suggest to get one size up"
5.0,"Bought these great shoes for my son, who is a Freshman in high school.  He loves them.  They fit him perfectly, and have that great Vans retro look that takes me back to the 80's.  Good value, high quality shoes that we would purchase again."

5.0,"I got this to slip on / off so I went a half size up and it fits very well. I love the look and the it's comfortable.

Takes a little getting used to as there is not much rubber between the ball of your foot and the cement. Excellent shoe for warm weather / low socks for a casual look."
5.0,These r awesome!  Really cute and really comfortable
5.0,"Looks great, fit fine for my size (11) as ordered. I usually insert gel inserts in my shoes, so once I did that it became snug, but they aren't broken in yet. Good buy for the price."
5.0,"Fits well, holding up well for my teenage daughter. Easy to clean and maintain that white glow!"
5.0,fav shoe
5.0,good looking.
1.0,"Super disappointed in the make of the shoe. The fabric tore two weeks after purchase. Now he can wear them at all. He said they tore when he was on his skateboard, but that is what they are geared for right??"
4.0,Looks exactly like the pictures. I love them 
5.0,Comfy and perfectly fit.
5.0,"Vans are cool, it makes me feel cool when I wear them."
5.0,Great shoes for work.
5.0,Love these sneakers. Not my first pair and won't be my last.
4.0,Love the shoes but they seem a little small.
5.0,Great shoes. Son's feet grew more then I thought they did so we have to send them back.
5.0,"Awesome, love them"
4.0,He loved them!
5.0,Great
5.0,I get compliments on these ALL the time. Love them.
5.0,Love the shoe but size run differently than most other shoes so we had to return and re order
5.0,"Super comfortable and very stylish. It's been a long time since I bought a pair of VANS and I've been eyeballing the black/charcoal checkered slip-ons for a while... wish I hadn't waited so long. My absolute favorite pair of shoes! A little stiff at first, which is normal for canvas, but broke in very quickly. My feet are wide at the front and narrow at the heel so I have trouble finding shoes that don't either squish my toes (potentially causing permanent nerve damage) or slide off my heels causing blisters and abrasions. The toe box of these shoes is wide enough to accomodate my wider front. They also have a padded heel which has molded to fit me perfectly: no more sliding off ---> no more blisters/abrasions = happy feet! I am extremely satisfied and happy with this purchase."
1.0,too small and too heavy
1.0,too small and too heavy
5.0,I love my white vans and was happy to find some on Amazon with Prime shipping. They are exactly as I expected. I referenced an old pair of vans I have for size and they fit perfectly. The shipping was quick and overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.
3.0,Fit a little snug for an 8. Look nice though
4.0,"I'm a 9.5 and my feet were sliding when I first put them on (without socks, smart idea). That tells me that Vans shoes are made narrow and long. They slightly hurt because of that, but they feel good with socks and will feel better once I wear them more often. Overall, loved them!!"
5.0,"Great shoe, and it arrived quickly!"
1.0,"Had a pair of vans for 5 years, decided to replace them with these, same style just a different design on the fabric or so I thought, these fit completely differently and always hurt my feet."
5.0,very sastified
5.0,Perfect and cheaper than the mall.
5.0,Love them Vans
2.0,"I usually wear a size 9, but these vans are so tight and snug I tried breaking them in but it was no use, they hurt every time I put them on."
4.0,These were ordered because the other shoes we ordered were to large.  However the other shoes got someone else in the family.  These shoes did take a very long time to arrive.
5.0,Good deal
5.0,"Super comfy. I wear these to work everyday! They are indeed true to size. At first, of course they're going to be ""too tight""! They're brand new shoes! You have to break them in! After a few days, they don't feel too bad and even better after a few months."
5.0,cool stuff
4.0,I was sent the wrong colorway but i kept em anyway. I would give a 5 star if wasn't for that mistake but otherwise these always been a great shoe
5.0,Nice shoes. My son really liked them.
5.0,Bought these so my young adult granddaughter and she just loves her white Vans.
5.0,Needs to break in at first but is then comfortable.  Matches my vintage Jeep.
4.0,"Good shoe, especially after it's broken it."
2.0,The size on these is a bit smaller than those found in brick and mortar stores.  The padding around the back-top of the shoes at the achilles is rotated down into the heel of the shoe rather than being stitched in the proper location.  the threads cause blisters on the top of my heels.
5.0,
5.0,"Very comfortable - but, I wish they had an arch. I can add one, no problem."
5.0,love the ease of a good slipon
4.0,"Gave me blisters at first, but now I love them and wear them all the time"
5.0,They're perfect and got here really quick!
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes!!! I'll be buying forever!
5.0,legit and fit as expected...
4.0,"My husbands last pair of vans just like this were a size 10, so I purchased the 10 however this shoe is about 1"" smaller than the other pair. He tried to wear them hoping they just needed to stretch but nope these are just too small. Shoe is great as descirbed, we will be ordering a larger size."
5.0,We buy these for an easy on/off shoe option for my kids.  This print looks great!
5.0,Nice fun shoe!
1.0,Inaccurate sizes
5.0,"Very pleased with my purchase. At first I received the wrong item but was able to contact seller and I received an immediate response and was able to ship the wrong ones back and receive the correct ones I order. I am very happy and will be ordering more in the future.

Thanks."
5.0,My girlfriend loved them
3.0,"Shoes were cute but Amazon updated my order from a size 7.5 to a 6. I bought them elsewhere, spent more, but received what I actually ordered."
2.0,I got the all black and there's a defect on the rubber bumper on the back of the shoe. Where the Vans logo is printed in red is not complete on one shoe. It's missing like almost a 3rd of the logo...kinda whack.
4.0,Nice. Same ol vans. Just what we expect
5.0,"First time, every time."
4.0,Love these shoes just a little tight if you tend to have wider feet
5.0,Never jab a pair of slip ons before these things are comfy
5.0,Great shoe
4.0,"They fit as expected but they look a little different from the ones I bought at the store. Also the ones that I have were made at Dominican Republic, the ones that I ordered in amazon were made in China, I don't know if that has something to do. I'm sending three photos so you can also look at the differences of the ones I bought at the store and the ones I bought from Amazon."
5.0,Great fit! Super comfortable
5.0,Love this!
3.0,"My son loves the slip on style shoes, and this was a perfect choice for him.  The size was a little to big, but with socks, it fits great."
5.0,"Perfect fit, comfy as :)"
5.0,Received as ordered!
4.0,"Shoe runs on the small side for the size 13M, at least a 1/2 size smaller than standard."
5.0,Perfect fit.
4.0,They fit fine. I escaped navy blue.
5.0,Perfection
4.0,They're great shoes but didn't fit. Always go larger when buying Vans!
5.0,My favorite shoes for everyday wear and tear.
5.0,The box came a little damaged but that doesn't matter to me. Got here super quick! I love them! They look just like the picture. I got a 9.5 in womens which is an 8 in men. Love them :-)
5.0,Love these shoes! Way better deal than in stores. Very happy!
5.0,Son is very happy with these. Must wear with socks at first to avoid blisters
5.0,"There was no size listed on Amazon so I took a chance and ordered 2 pairs since they were twenty bucks each as I have 6-8 different people who I could give them to based on the size(s) sent.  They sent me two pairs of 7 1/2 mens.  Fits my daughter - bingo!  Too small for any of my boys, but I'll find someone who can fit them."
5.0,7 mens 8.5 womens is perfect for me in these. Been buying the slip-ons for years and love them. 
5.0,"I'm a women's 9, I ordered a 7.5, fits great"
5.0,Awesome thank you!!!!
5.0,"Great shoe, great price, great fit, and a great happy daughter. She now has 3 pairs, black, checker, and denim.  Ready for school and play.
I'll order again when these wear out or her foot grows more. Recommend these to anyone looking for a great fitting pair of Vans."
3.0,Ordered same size as I always get.  They just feel alittle tight.
5.0,Excellant shoes! Great quality and true to size!
5.0,Vans are good slip on shoes and fit well. They are simple in design and subtle. They have minimum padding.
5.0,My 2nd pair of Vans. Stylish and comfortable.
5.0,"Order a size larger than you normally do. They run small. I wear a size 12. I ordered a 12 and they fit, but were snug. I then ordered a 13. The 13's fit perfect."
5.0,A+++
4.0,good shoes but i think the style is ugly irl
5.0,On point
5.0,Perfect On the GO shoe!
5.0,"Very nice shoe, comfortable, casual. Great w jeans and shorts. I really like the style and have been wearing them most of the summer. Should last several."
5.0,"Old school love them, size was exact im a 10 wmns and I got a 10"
5.0,Ordered a 13 in men's and it fit perfectly.
1.0,"Horrible shoes.. Wish I can return them.  Rub up against the pinky toes and very little support and padding and hurts to walk on.  I bought based on the reviews that others had left, but very dissapointed as these are going in the trash."
4.0,love them
5.0,"My Vans did not let me down, I expected the best and got the best.
They feel, fit and look great."
5.0,"Newer vans seem tighter than they used to be. I got one size up, and the length is perfect but they are tight across the top. I have a normal size/width foot. The shoes arrived quickly and were as specified."
4.0,"color stated as navy blue, but is more of a baby blue"
5.0,Gotta love Vans. Been wearing them for 30 years. Best shoes ever!
5.0,nice sneaker usually wear a size 8 to 8.5 shoe ordered size 9 fits perfectly.
2.0,It's too small and I didn't get a return or exchange size slip
5.0,Comfortable but also supportive!
2.0,Returned.  No issues.  Runs small
5.0,Great shoes
1.0,Too small. I sent them back.
4.0,"I ordered a size 10.5 in mens shoe size and I got a size 10 which is just a little narrower and tighter than I'd like it to be, but other than that problem I love the shoes and they are starting to losen up the more that I wear them."
5.0,Fits my son well.
4.0,I love these shoes they are comfy once you get them on it's a little work out the first time. I would suggest get a size up. I'm a 10.5 and I originally ordered a 10.5 and had to send them back for a size 11 that was still a little snug but fit fine once on. These shoes are VERY white I suggest using scotch guard to waterproof the shoes. Also would suggest wearing thin socks so you can easily slip the shoe on. Overall because I love vans shoes I will reorder again.
4.0,Great shoe! Lasted me almost a whole year and I'm very rough on shoes.
4.0,"Had a pair in black & wanted navy too. The color is a little lighter than I wanted, but it is fine. It doesn't slip on as easily as the black ones I have. Maybe it will be better with time. Once on, it is very comfortable."
4.0,"A little snug for a size 12.  Fortunately not snug enough to be a problem, but definitely a bit smaller than perhaps they should be.  I've been buying size 12 shoes, including many many Vans slip ons, for over 30 years.  First pair of 12's that felt snug."
5.0,Love them
5.0,Great shoe!! Even better if you add orthotics.
5.0,These kicks are da best
2.0,Went to store to try on vans shoes to determine correct size prior to ordering. Shoes too small when they arrived.
5.0,They have the same fit/quality they always have.
4.0,"I find these shoes to be too hot for my feet. I've got the hot feet!
Seriously, they aren't very airy. I don't like my feet to sweat too bad, but I do wear them to work, and take them off under the desk"
2.0,very narrow and came delivered ripped had to send back
4.0,"Love the Vans and the style, but are too large for our grandson!"
5.0,daughter loves these!!
3.0,"Really snug fitting. Then again, I'm used to the non-slip on type. Recommended for people that don't have slightly wider feet."
5.0,I love the shoes they fit perfectly and they go Great with jeans
4.0,The one shoe was whiter than the other. The other looked yellow and used. Also a little too small.
5.0,They came in perfect condiotion and fit just as i expected !
2.0,Being unisex provoque that men's size is not what expected in regards the standard.
5.0,I'm a Women's size 7.5. Bought the Men's 6 D(M) and they fit perfectly. Super comfortable shoes. Love it so much that I bought another pair in white. Don't know what other people were talking about their shoes not fitting. I think they just don't know how to order the right shoe size since all of these sizes are in men's.
3.0,"I bought these in a 15 for my husband. Because his feet are so large (canoes I tell him) we have to order almost all of his shoes online. He is always a 15- these came and we were so excited! However, when he tried them on they were at least a half a size to a size too large. We tried to return them for a smaller size, but they didn't have any 14 or 14.5s in stock. Great looking shoe, just not at all sized like we have seen others sized."
5.0,Nice shoes but too small
3.0,to smalll had to return still waiting for my money back
3.0,"I didn't give a high rating because, my son wears a 10 1/2 and these.fit like an 11"
5.0,So cute love them
5.0,Great shoes so far!
5.0,"Great, attractive shes!"
5.0,"LOVE these.....my 3rd pair of vans. this is first pair that has left blisters on my heels but i will break them in, won't let that slow me down, otherwise can wear all day"
5.0,gift
5.0,Love them!  They are fun
5.0,Nice shoes. I am usually a 7-7 1/2 womens so yea I mean they were a little small on me but I usually have issues with shoes bc different brands fit me different. I am returning them to try the next size.
5.0,Vans - what can you say- classic!
5.0,COOL
5.0,"I like Vans, these were too small though"
5.0,"Perfect. Size 10. Fit as a normal shoe for me, not a tennis shoe.  I have get an 11 in a tennis shoe"
4.0,"I bought on 14th July, I don't have Prime but it came quickly on 18th July. It's pretty small, but comfortable. I checked the barcode, Its real one. Thank you, I love it!!!"
4.0,can not even get the shoe on.
3.0,They are way to narrow and my son couldn't get his foot into the shoe.
5.0,I love them.
4.0,"Just a bit small but otherwise, my growing son likes the shoes, especially the color."
3.0,Great price but they don't fit for comfort. Would like them to fit like Sperry
5.0,Great look. Tight.
5.0,My all-time favorite pair of shoes! Vans slip-ons are so comfy!
5.0,Fit as expected and this is what the kids like to wear.
5.0,Loved them
5.0,Timeless classic. Always in style and comfortable to boot!!
5.0,Item was as expected and arrived on time.
5.0,"I bought these for my son and he loves them.  This is high praise for these shoes, since he has never really had any fashion sense and has been willing to wear raggedy tennis shoes with holes in them.  He says they are comfortable and slightly off-beat (which works well for him).  I also bought a black pair for him, and he wore them both within the first two days."
5.0,My daughter loves them. We bought these for her for back to school. They are everything she was expecting. Very good brand of shoes very great quality.
5.0,cant go wrong with the classic vans.
5.0,I've been wearing Vans since I could walk and I'm 42 now! Everyone's different but they fit me perfect and have been true to size every time. The classic style will never get old (to me anyway) and I will continue to wear my Vans until the day I take that long dirt nap.
5.0,Met expectations!
5.0,Great Product and Great Service
1.0,One shoe is completely different from the other.
5.0,"Great shoes, great quality, and great price!!"
4.0,"Love vans, I'm such a huge fan the only thing I don't like is the back started rubbing on the back and broke the skin. Other then that I have no compliants"
5.0,The best fit. Super comfortable.
4.0,i had to squeeze in a bit but when they were fully in they were very comfy and SOOOOO CUTE I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM
5.0,"Classic Vans fit and style. I ordered the same size I purchased at a Vans' outlet store, and they fit the same."
4.0,"Great fit, no issues, looks great"
1.0,"Shoes were either defective or of poor quality. Wore only occasionally for 2 1/2 months and the fabric in the inside of one separated from the canvus and as shown in these pictures the canvus is already separating from the sole. Do not buy if you plan to wear them like shoes are meant to be worn. Maybe I have high expectations, but I expect shoes to last at least a year, these won't make it 3 months and I am not rough on them."
5.0,Great! Ordered a boy's size 5 to fit my daughter's size 6.5 shoe size. Fits perfectly. Immediately put 3 coats of Scotchguard to hopefully keep clean for a long time. Fast shipping too! She loves them.
5.0,We just love our Vans
5.0,"i am extremely pleased with my shoes. they came 4 days earlier than expected and fit perfectly, will be purchasing more"
5.0,Perfect fit and fast shipping.
1.0,I ordered a full size bigger than what I wear and I can barely put these on with socks. Shame. They are nice looking shoes.
5.0,Great! Fits perfectly.
5.0,Love these shoes..very comfortable.
4.0,"My son loved them, fit great."
5.0,"These shoes are amazing! They look and feel great.  Sometimes, when Vans arrive they might feel a little small.  Put them in the microwave for 30 seconds and then slip them on your feet.  They stretch and mold as if you'd been wearing them for months.  So glad I knew of this, otherwise I would have thought I had the wrong size."
5.0,"Second pair, and new ones never feel as perfect as the almost worn out ones. So cute, so comfortable, love 'em."
5.0,My wife loves her vans.
4.0,It's what my son expected. Comfortable
5.0,Confortable shoes ! Great for walking
5.0,Perfect! Thank you!
5.0,Thanks!  Love these!
4.0,Love these but it takes a couple wears to break them in. Super comfy now though!
5.0,"very comfortable, easy to slip on.  I've been wearing vans since my skating days 30 years ago."
5.0,"Nice shoes, just too small.  The bigger size was better."
5.0,"Only classic checkered Vans can save you, and this deep red combo with black is especially deadly.  There's nothing else to say, move along."
4.0,The problem with Vans is that they don't make wide sneakers. All their bigger sizes are D width so I have to order a size up so they fit. Besides that they're a great summer shoe.
5.0,Perfect Fit
5.0,"They look good, light weight, and fit true. Not a good work shoe, but they never claimed to be. Good for style and lazy days."
5.0,My favorite shoe. Lasts a little over 6 months on every day use.
5.0,Perfect just like vans should be
5.0,Love these shoes.
4.0,Gift and they seemed to like them.
5.0,"I LOVE THESE SHOES. They're so comfortable, and I've pretty much worn them every day since I've had them (a few months now) and they haven't gotten stretched out at all. I got them hella muddy one day and was easily able to clean the canvas completely. I definitely recommend these!"
5.0,Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned
5.0,"These are some of my favorite shoes, they are comfortable. I get compliments on them all the time (gray/black check)"
4.0,...because they don't offer cheap or easy to order wide or half sizes I order the half size small and stretch the canvas myself. It's kind of a bummer but if the shoe fits...
5.0,Good price. Exactly what she wanted for a gift. Had to return for 1/2 size bigger. Came very quickly.
5.0,"I just LOVE my Vans!!
I never had a pair of Vans before, so I read all the previous reviews and ordered my regular size a 8.5M and they are perfect.
They are so comfortable too, the first time I wore them it was all day shopping and had no feet issues. (and I do have problems with my feet, I have to be careful how a shoe fits.)"
5.0,My husband's favorite shoes. They fit a bit tight at first but they break in nicely and are super comfortable and reliable.
4.0,"A bit on the small side when you put your foot in, but then the size is as expected. I had a previous pair that was the same way and broke in after a little while"
5.0,Very pleased with the product and the service
5.0,They're great I love them!
5.0,Love these shoes.
5.0,Perfect. Just what I wanted and expected.
5.0,Damn Daniel
5.0,Great
5.0,"Authentic, and true to size in both width and length. Zero arch support for those over forty. These Vans slay me; the checkerboard style reminds me of high school, 5,000 years ago, and dancing with the Italian Formula One team in Long Beach 4,000 years ago.  That's right, I'm having a mid-life crisis and Vans helps assuage my desires."
5.0,Fit just right shipping fast.
4.0,Fairly easy to put on and look nice for what they are.
5.0,"Easy to slip on! Love this shoes, so convenient! Got dirty quick as expected with white shoes lol but nothing oxiclean cant fix!"
5.0,"I love the style! This shoe goes perfectly well with my other clothes! Additoinally, the chart accurately fits my shoe size; it fits perfectly well on my feet!"
5.0,Shoes fit perfectly and are easy to slip on with a shoe horn. I expected the sizing to be problematic but it wasnt.
1.0,To tight on my arch
4.0,fit was a little tighter than i expected.
4.0,My daughter loves it
4.0,"Fast Times and Ridgemont High approved. Easy On, Easy Off. I never know what size to get... if I run my usual size 10, my feet slide around too much. If I wear the 9.5 I can really only wear them without socks. So that's what I do. It makes for a good summer shoe."
5.0,Super cute and comfy.  Vans is a reliable brand and I needed some comfy causal slip-ins to get the job done...these fit the bill!
5.0,Product was as advertised and fit as expected.
5.0,I bought a size up and they were perfect.
5.0,"I know the black and white checkerboards are all the rage now, so this is nice if you don't want to look like everyone and don't want plain black or grey. Didn't cut at the ankles and was comfortable from first wear. I usually wear an 11.5, but 12s were comfortable enough."
5.0,Vans are the best.
5.0,Exactly as advertised. The fit is a little tight when you first get the sneakers but once you break them in they are golden.
5.0,Delivered as expected.
2.0,Size a bit too small.
5.0,Perfect fit. Such a comfortable shoe. Great price
5.0,The sizing is tricky between the women's and men' sizes but once you know your size you keep buying these shoes
2.0,way too narrow for my foot
5.0,Just what they wanted.
5.0,I absolutely love the shoes!
5.0,"i love these vans, i wear them almost everyday but they do cause blisters on the heels on my feet"
5.0,Very comfortable!  I ordered a 1/2 size up as I read reviews that said that they ran a little small and they fit perfectly.
5.0,"Love these, always VANS."
5.0,"Nice product, quick shipping, great deal!"
2.0,This pair is way tighter (to the point of discomfort) than my old pair of the same size that I bought years ago from a Vans store. It makes me wonder if these are knock-offs or the real thing.
4.0,love these. Classic.
5.0,Great shoes!
4.0,Good quality and for as expected. Always happy with my Vans slip-ons.
5.0,"love my vans, true to size"
5.0,Comfortable walking shoe. I would definitely recommend.
5.0,"very comfortable, looks great, and a great value!"
5.0,Great shoe and fast delivery
4.0,They look great and my boyfriend really loves them! He did have to stretch them out a bit so keep that in mind
5.0,very nice casual shoe for the price
1.0,returned them. they weren't the proper size
5.0,I wear these all the time! I have wide fwet and they fit really well
5.0,"PERFECT..DIFFERENT....EVERYONE HAD POSITIVE COMMENTS.  WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING DIFFERENT SYTLES FROM VANS.  YOU CAN'T GO WRONG, EVERYONE WILL BE JEALOUS."
1.0,"BEWARE, If it sounds to good to be true it usually is. A pair of Vans slip-ons for $18, I should have known better! "
5.0,"Son loves them Great shoes, fit perfect nice color!! Recommend
Came on time packaging was great
Will buy again. Thanks"
5.0,Ladies!!!!! Buy these!!!! You are never too old for Vans. :)
4.0,"Product was perfect, although it arrived 2 days late."
1.0,Terrible.  Ordered a size 10 VANS.  Encircled a size 13 imitation.
5.0,I love them. I wear a 7.5 in women's and the men's 6 fit perfectly.
5.0,Great slip on shoes!
5.0,My son will not wear anything else
5.0,"Classic, authentic Vans shoe, great color, shipped super fast with Prime.  Super happy.  Rock these with your distressed jeans cuffed a white tee and you are in business."
5.0,They were just what I wanted.
5.0,"fits perfectly but id recommend not wearing ankle socks with this sort of shoe as its a bit abrasive on the back of your heel. Other then that, wear taller socks with them and they look good !"
2.0,"Great looking shoe, narrow fit."
5.0,"These are all I wear during the summer. Super simple, and easy to slip on."
2.0,"I normally wear an 11, but it was too small.  Reordered a 12, and it is a shade too small.  Wish they had 1/2 sizes, as what I probably need is an 11 1/2.  I did not think that the 11 would stretch out."
5.0,"I was looking for the right shoe to go with my jeans, these work, love them!"
5.0,Perfect
5.0,"I've been wearing Vans since 1979. I bought my neice her 1st pair when she was 6 months old and this pair is for her Junior Prom! Vans haven't changed much in the last 30 or so years, classic and dependable!"
4.0,"These shoes were super nice and exactly what we ordered. Unfortunately, the size was tighter than we expected. We missed the return window so we are hoping they will fit another family member soon!"
5.0,"Great confy shoes. Fast shipping, Recommended"
5.0,"Love it, this is my second pair."
5.0,Reliable and not expensive.
5.0,Great classic Vans for an excellent price
3.0,Get a half size bigger than you think
3.0,"Great nice shoes for anywhere but got the wrong size, just a bit to big!"
3.0,Run kinda small
1.0,"I must say, I love Vans slip-ons for what they are, usually.

The first issue, I ordered these in men's 11, I  am a 10.5, and surprisingly they were small. Not bad, I'll break them in, whatever.

The second issue, from day one they leak through the soles. The bottom up, soaked feet. Constantly. Of course it rained the first day I wore them out.

But I love these shoes, they are too small and they leak. No big deal until I'm at the game and I use the restroom and step in piss.

Style wise, these are simply great shoes. Function wise, these shoes (the ones I received from my Amazon order) were and are a failure.

I don't love these Vans."
5.0,Perfect.
1.0,"Ouch.  These shoes hurt.

Basically, they should be slippers with a sole.  Instead, they are as comfortable as 70s era roller skates.  The best feeling I get with them is taking them off.

How is this even possible?"
5.0,Cool as always. Perfect slip on for the weekends and after work. Im a size 9 in men's and it fits true to size.
5.0,Luv these. Wear 10.5 but ordered 11. Perfect fit.
5.0,I love them. Perfect!!!
4.0,"Not sure why but I purchased these shows from my local vans shop, same size different color, and the ones I ordered on here were a lot tighter. Still fit, but were not as comfortable as the same model I purchased locally."
5.0,They are awesome
4.0,I purchased the blue pair and last year I purchased the gray pair of Vans.  the model from last year fit my feet pretty good but the pair I bought this year are tight in the toes - and actually rubbed my little toe raw.  I don't know if they changed the sizing or if these need broken in but I have never had to break in a pair of Vans.  If they stretch to be more comfortable I will update this post.  Quality is the same as always for Vans - no complaints and hold up well when worn.
3.0,Ran small and the toes paid for it...
5.0,"I bought a size 7, it fit like a 6.5. I've had tons of Vans so I wasn't sure why that was. They fit well either way. Time will tell how long they last."
5.0,simple and stylish.
5.0,All good
4.0,"Great shoes in general with great traction and a snazzy look, but if I buy again I'll definitely go with a wider fit. These are a bit too snug. I'll update after wearing them a bit to see if the fit relaxes any with wear."
5.0,"the vans arrived in two days, which was really nice. they expedited the shipping for no apparent reason. the shoes are good too, but somewhat small. i'm normally a size 6 but i had to swap to a 6.5. maybe my feet got fat or something or these run small. either way, fast shipping and great product."
5.0,"Good looking, Good price. Thanks"
5.0,Couldn't wait for this to come in! So happy it came in right away. Perfect fit!
5.0,I really like these shoes and they fit great
5.0,Love my Vans
5.0,"These are great, fit well, quality as good as ever. Nice product"
1.0,Vans are too small. Need to exchange for bigger size.
3.0,"Some what small of a fit, seem to be well constructed, but only time will tell. Over all seem like a good purchase."
4.0,Little hard to get on but fit fine once on. I guess I just have fat feet.
5.0,Great shoes at over $10 cheaper than in-store!
5.0,"Super comfortable, and they look great! Fit exactly as I expected and they look great."
5.0,Exactly as pictured and fits as expected. I will definitely be purchasing again from this seller!
4.0,They were too small for my son but I ordered a half size up and they are fine.
5.0,Just as expected
5.0,Love em
5.0,"Awesome shoe, quick delivery"
2.0,"I like Vans in general but this was caused me blisters. It is the quality how this one was made. A lot of excess materials that you can actuallu feel and when you remove, the excess is printed or marked on your skin."
4.0,Seem to be the same vans I usually buy at the mall. great shoes. I  buy the same sizes I  usually by there a little snug but these should stretch. They Were shipped  very fast. Good service and shoes
5.0,Exactly what I was expecting!
5.0,"My son loves his vans, they fit perfect."
5.0,Love these shoes!
5.0,Love them
5.0,Fit and look good - quick delivery too.
4.0,Came quickly but were a tad tight although that's usually how vans run is a bit on the smaller side. I would suggest a half size up but they will stretch a little if you plan on wearing them a lot.
5.0,Great shoe !
2.0,Too small says it all
5.0,
5.0,My daughter ordered these and they are fabulous!
5.0,Son thinks they are awesome!
5.0,Excellent price and fits as expected.
2.0,"Returned. Would have kept if they weren't made so poorly. Very rough inside, at glued points and edges of elastic. So would rub a foot raw - if one didn't modify in some way. Too expensive to do that.

Plus I ordered lace-up. Changed to slip-on when added to my cart. What's up with that Amazon?"
5.0,Love these!
5.0,"Classic Vans, perfect fit, Happy customers!  Great looking shoe and we just love them!"
4.0,"I ordered the same size as my last pair, which still fit. This new pair were a bit tight. I am assuming they will stretch as I wear them. I think that I  might go a half size up next time."
5.0,My bf loves these!!
3.0,Super tight fitting. I should have gotten 1 size bigger than my normal shoe size.
5.0,Greatest show ever made. Is a shame most Vans available now are lace. But these are still the King
5.0,"I've worn Vans for over 40 years, although I used to have to buy them in a Mens.  These fit exactly as expected with a nice arch support.  If you prefer to insert your own supports I doubt you'd need to go up a size if you pull whats in there out - they're pretty thick.
I spray some waterproof on these and they last forever."
5.0,Great!
5.0,GOOD!
5.0,Love them
2.0,Love the vans slip on's but the picture description is wrong. The picture shows the black leather perforated slip on vans  with black soles which I thought I was receiving but it's actually just the classic slip on.'s with brown sole. Will change review after I find out if this is a mix up or not.
4.0,purchased as a gift but she wears them quite often and loves them
5.0,"Hey, what can I say?  This is a shoe staple!"
5.0,As expected. Great buy.
3.0,"Too small even though label states ""Size 14"". Took to shoe repair to adjust elastic. Fits snugly. Just bought Size 15 from another retail outlet"
3.0,These run long and narrow. I wear a 10.5. I ordered these in a 10. Still to long.
5.0,my mom love them
5.0,Fit nice
5.0,Yay! Finally in my size and a great price!!
5.0,"Love the style, very comfortable and a decent price."
3.0,Fit a bit smaller than I was expecting.  They seemed to be a 1/2 smaller than Van's Perf Leather Slip-Ons.
5.0,Perfect for Husband! Great price! Great shoes!!
5.0,Damn.
5.0,These are some slick shoes. I love them. They fit well and I've already gotten compliments on them. 10/10 would buy again.
5.0,Vans are vans. Last pair lasted like 5 years of daily use.
5.0,"this fits perfect with socks on. great seller, good packing and delivered on top. i love how they look and feel. i would recommend"
3.0,"they sent me a size 15!  about 4 sizes too large. looks like clown shoes. otherwise, it's fine."
5.0,Got this for my dad- he loves them!
5.0,Perfect
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes!!
5.0,"I love my new shoes.  Very fast shipment, thank you."
4.0,Tight around the sides

5.0,My Grandniece wears these all the time. She loves them!!
5.0,"Bought it for my brother, he likes it."

5.0,gangster af  love these

5.0,These are my first pair of vans. Comfortable right away. I almost always wear a size seven and these 7's fit fine.
5.0,They came faster than expected plus they fit.
2.0,"These wore out very quickly. My son had them about 2 months before they had holes in the top of the toes. Will not purchase again, but my son did really love the look of them."
5.0,True to size
4.0,"Great shoe, order one size bigger than you normally wear..."
5.0,Great shoes
5.0,Basic simple Vans fits well to size chart
5.0,Just what I wanted and real fast delivery in less than 24 hrs
5.0,Love these ..
4.0,Fit a little tight.  My husband usually wears 10.5 to 11 and I got a size 11 and they were snug. He is hoping the break in.
5.0,Very comfortable shoe and I don't normally go to slip on shoes.
5.0,as described....fits great
5.0,Loves them.
5.0,super comfy
5.0,EXCELENT
5.0,"Nice shoe, nice price."
5.0,Nothing to say
2.0,bad
5.0,Exactly like the ones in the store.
5.0,daughter loves these shows I got her.
5.0,"These are very well constructed and fit beautifully! I love them! Fast shipping with Amazon Prime, too."
3.0,These looked good but fit big and all my other same style vans are the same size. In addition to that the sewing and seams inside is shotty making me believe maybe these are not legitimate Vans
4.0,The only downside to this shoe is that your toe busts right through the canvas if there is any rubbing. These shoes have to be replaced often.
4.0,The show itself is a classic but I ordered the wrong size. I'm returning and ordering a bigger size. I find that Vans run half a size smaller than regular shoes.
3.0,fit was a little off just a tad smaller than expected
4.0,"My husband loves them! I bought Size 14 white vans as a gift.
Quick tip. Don't clean with bleach, it turned a creamish color on the area he cleaned. Top of the shoe where its most noticed. We ordered another pair cause it was impossible to fix. Overall he loves these shoes."
5.0,Love these I got these to match my 5 year old little girl shoes.
1.0,The stich is starting to come out
5.0,Bought for my daughter and she loves. They are holding their color and holding up well. Impressed . . . would definitely recommend purchasing.
5.0,My husband loves them
2.0,did not like them sent them back
5.0,"Bought these for my husband, he loves them! He even wears them to work often. He's on his feet all day and has yet to come home complaining of sore back or feet."
5.0,"Super cute shoes, fit perfectly.  Now to break them i and let this painful blister heal."
5.0,"Dude, These checkered shoes are totally awesome"
5.0,"there vans what can i say, i've been wearing these since fast time at ridgemont high came out!"
5.0,Love vans
4.0,Small
4.0,They are somewhat tighter than the last (same size) Vans slip ons I just wore out.  Hoping they stretch out to more comfort.
5.0,Love them. Size 13 is really a 13
5.0,Classic shoes. Step daughter was happy.
4.0,"Love me a black pair of slip-ons, only down side is that there seems to be extra material piled up on the tongue of my right shoe. Not the end of the world but still a bit annoying. Whether I can fix it or not doesn't matter much since these things are so cheap I go through them pretty quick!"
5.0,My husband's favorite shoe! I think I've bought him 2-3 pairs of these in the last 5 years.  Only complaint is that the rubber siding starts to peel away within a year of regular wear making them look bad.
2.0,The manufacturer is lying about the size.  Way too small.  Liars.
5.0,Fantastic
5.0,"Comfortable, wear them every day."
5.0,Just what I expected.
5.0,I looooove these
5.0,"I always have a pair of these in my rotation. Comfortable, especially in the summer. I'm a size 8 but these run a size bigger."

5.0,"Fast delivery,  nice shoes!"

5.0,VERY NICE!

5.0,I just love these for summer!

5.0,"Vans, they always fit good and very comfortable, easy to slip on and go."
5.0,Best casual shoes ever match with everything.
5.0,"One of the best made shoes for comfort, durability and ease to put on/off."
5.0,Very nice shoes
5.0,Nice shoes
4.0,Ordered as gift for grandson in size 10 mens.  Quality and delivery were great however the size was a bit tight and so reordered in a 10:5.  Return process was the simplest ever...
5.0,My husband absolutely LOVES these shoes and wears them everywhere whether they match his clothing or not (much to the dismay of our teenager!). He gets tons of compliments on them!
5.0,Great
5.0,"Love the shoes as I have a few pairs, but these were somewhat smaller. Not sure why."
5.0,"He loved them! Great quality as usual with Vans. Denim doesn't look too much like jeans, is just nice & thick dark gray fabric."
5.0,they were for my husband he loves them
5.0,Stellar...old school cool!
5.0,Reliable Vans.
4.0,The shoes were in bit big. We ordered the men's size 9/7.5 women's and they are almost a full size too big from my last pair that were the same size.
3.0,Shoe was new but it was to small.  I will be returning.
1.0,Shoes are too big and not the right size
5.0,Have had 4 months. Great shoes.
2.0,Disappointed at the fit. I usually wear a 6.5 in woman's but when I ordered these the shoe looks and feels way tighter than expected. Sucks but I Yess I'll have to try and break them in
5.0,Perfect and AUTHENTIC . Loving my da** Daniels
5.0,"Good price, great style offerings & shipped fast. Will buy again from here !"
4.0,Our son loves tham! They do run a little small so order a half size bigger than your normal size.
5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she love it
3.0,pretty big i wish i could exchange them. i still haven't worn them .
5.0,I love these shoes its my 3 pair
5.0,Lots of compliments.
5.0,"This is my second time purchasing this shoe. It feels great and it's functionality is long-lasting, but appearance-wise it starts to show wear sooner than I expected, resulting in white areas where the dyed surface had worn away."
5.0,"Classic and sharp-looking pair of shoes. I love the dark checkered pattern. Looks casual with a pair of jeans, and also works with shorts."
5.0,Teenager loves them!
5.0,My daughter loves it
5.0,Just as good as the store and even cheaper! These were brand new and good quality. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Great. A classic. Loads of compliments at my Artsy Liberal Arts College, so you know it's good."
3.0,For the price the quality could be better. Purchased a half size up and they are still tight.
1.0,Shoes are white and came dirty and worn out not even the original box and was really cheap
4.0,"Very uncomfortable at first, and took quite a while to wear in. They're still a little tight, especially on the tops of my feet, but they did get better after a few weeks. They're not bad, but I probably won't be buying another pair."
5.0,Great have always wanted a pair of these
4.0,I love vans. This is a good pair to just slip on & go. A must have
1.0,Too small. Not true to size.
5.0,Love my vans!! A little tight at first but after a day of teaching they broke in easily. I highly recommend.
5.0,"Exactly the colour and style as seen in the pictures. Origina Vans canvas shoes (the plain ones) and very comfortable. It does take a little while to break into, but that is to be expected from these sturdy shoes. I had also bought them to draw a design on and they worked really well for that. The edging had some glue of some kind which was a little difficult to draw over with fabric marker and the colour did change a little there but it is nothing to be concerned about. I would definitely buy them again."
5.0,Super comfortable shoe.  I feel like I've never been disappointed with Vans although the slip-ons seem to fall apart a bit quicker as much as I run around 5/6 days a week at work and out biking/hiking.
5.0,our son loved them and they fit perfect!
5.0,"They came on time,they were brand new and fitted perfectly"
5.0,"Love 'em, look cool and pretty comfortable."
1.0,Had to return them way to small.
5.0,AS EXPECTED
5.0,literally all I can say is.... THANK GOD FOR VANS.
4.0,Great
3.0,"I bought these in a size 6, and my feet are pretty spot on size 6.  These fit, but they are very tight.  There's no way to wear with socks, and if I don't wear socks then they rub blisters on my heels and my little toe.  I tried the size 6.5 before buying these, but those flopped on my feet - too big.  I'm not sure what to say.  I like the shoes and they look great, but they just don't fit well.  I can't suggest buying the right size or a size up because they just don't fit."
5.0,Men's 10 ran large so they were returned without hassle and a smaller size was not available.
1.0,Nope
4.0,"I love vans for their versatility, but they really don't hold up in any job involving a lot of lifting, squatting etc. After 2 months on a delivery route, they're beat. Rubber is coming unglued. And DO NOT put them in the wash, even on gentle with some towels. Same goes for dryer on low heat. Cracked the rubber but held their shape otherwise."
4.0,Okay
5.0,"Shoes fit as expected, nice stylish, can where with nice dress slacks or with your blue jeans, slip on and off very nicely, only negative is that after wearing all day it is a bit rough on your feet as there isn't much padding inside, buy an insert if you plan on wearing all day."
4.0,I purchased these Vans online and wasn't able to try them on.  They look great but they tend to be a little loose. Maybe with a small insole they would be fine. I would recommend these shoes.
5.0,What a find these were and after my wife shamed me out of trying them on in a teenager shop at the local mall.  They will replace my Sperry Top Sider slip-ons the selection of which has really gotten thin.  And a $50.00 - a real steal.  Very comfortable.  I am a fan and will be buying more.
2.0,"Unlike my old pair of Vans, these are really hurting my feet. Ive NEVER had foot pain from Vans. Im so bummed out. wondering if they are made differently now?"
5.0,great
5.0,"These are my favorite shoes for the fall and spring! They look cute with dresses, leggings, shorts, and jeans not to mention they are SUPER comfortable. They are the perfect show when you are in between flip flop and boot weather - highly recommend!"
5.0,I bought these for my son and he wears them almost everyday.
5.0,"Great fit and perfect for work
No arch support feels more like walking barefoot and prevents the arches from hurting after a long day"
5.0,They fit as expected. And my order came right on time. :)
5.0,Great shoes
5.0,Arrived as advertised.
5.0,"This is THE solution for shoes appropriate to physical therapy after hip replacement surgery. They are just snug enough. To be fair, I wear my shoes loosely as a rule, so your mileage may vary. Still, considering the limitations one must observe for the first few weeks of recovery, these things shouldn't need to be too tight. After all of the other expense (even with pretty decent insurance) of the procedure, popping fifty bucks for these things seemed pretty reasonable.

Hell, i might even wear them after i recover...."
5.0,perfect
5.0,Can never go wrong with a pair of Vans!  I grew up with them and still wear them.  I can wear them for hours.  Not amazing arch support like tennis shoes but absolutely better than flats or flip flops.
5.0,Always quality from Vans.  Look cool too.
5.0,As expected - great!
3.0,"The length is fine buy they are a little loose in the width, although the size said M medium."
5.0,"Runs somewhat small, but they loosen up the more you wear it"
5.0,Very pleased with these shoes
5.0,"Vans are a great classic shoe. Easy to slip on. They're rugged and well made. I ordered size 14 for my son, they fit perfectly."
3.0,"Run a little small,I'd order a half size larger Will order agin'''"
5.0,"My daughter loves these and wears them to school all day. They are comfortable. The arch support isn't incredible (like a running shoe) but it is good (better than other similarly designed tennis shoes). They fit as expected (She got the same size she always gets with other brands.) and are well made. We would (and will) buy these again, I am sure."
5.0,Classic Vans quality!
5.0,Love these!
4.0,small
4.0,love the shoe.  It my be my instep that makes them a bit tight.
5.0,"Love these shoes, I can wear em all day."
4.0,Comfortable slip-on tennies.
5.0,Good price and good shoes
5.0,love them!
5.0,COMFORT AND GOOD
1.0,Ordered 2x never right!! No mores
5.0,"Love these shoes. Been wearing the Vans variation going on 15 years now.

They can keep changing the name and look but they are still a great pair of black on black slip on shoes!"
5.0,Love the color and comfortable fit
5.0,These vans are super chill and they are so comfortable. Much better than converse For sure!!!!
5.0,"Shoe fits as expected, but I knew this before I bought. Great shoes do casual wear."
5.0,My husband and I love Vans!  Just knowing they fit a little small makes it easy to order the proper size to fit.
4.0,I bought size 9 which I normally wear but they are a little small and really hard to get on.
5.0,Vans for life!
5.0,"Nice, just what I was looking for."
4.0,Vans!!!  Dude!!!
5.0,They look and feel great. No complaints whatsoever!
4.0,"It says slip-ons but I received ones with shoelaces which I guess I don't really care about too much, especially for the given price. Delivery was beyond fast! Ordered them on a Friday afternoon and was surprised to get them on Monday."
4.0,a little tight.
5.0,"I have owned several pairs of these shoes in different patterns.  They are great for slip-on shoes, but no so comfortable after a few hours of being on your feet.  If you're looking for a pair of shoes to slip on around the house, look no further, but if you are going to be walking alot, keep looking."
5.0,Great shoe! Love them & they look good!
5.0,Love the shoes but a tad small
5.0,"Vans always fit as expected, always comfortable, always great color and print choices."
5.0,My daughter loves her Vans!!
5.0,"This item is perfect, service is flawless, I will order more."
5.0,Perfect fit and came in the brand new vans box with tags attached
5.0,Love them! They fit prefect!
5.0,
5.0,"True to size , very happy with my purchase"
5.0,"I normally wear a 7 or 7.5.  I ordered the 7.5. Perfect!  Holding up well. Vans are harder to ""slip on"" than some slip ons, but not a problem for me."
5.0,Cool looking and wears well.  I bought another pair with a different design.  Love them!
4.0,Narrow and tight but i am going to give them a shot and try to break them in.
4.0,"A classic pair of shoes, I've been wearing the same style for 10 years now. I would say over the years, the quality seems to have declined ever so slightly while the price has gone up, but I suppose I still find them good enough to keep buying them."
5.0,Perfect as usual.
4.0,"Good buy, good fit"
5.0,"The best for a reason. Vans is one of the original sneaker companies, and they're still around for a reason. Super comfortable and ultra stylish. These red and black checkerboards are sexy as hell, and the best past are the red bottoms. I love these with more than words can say."
5.0,"I love these Vans for everyday wear.  I recently traveled to Europe and wore them for sightseeing, and they did not disappoint.  Very comfortable and pure white :)"
1.0,I do not have wide feet at all and these shoes hurt so much...
4.0,These fit my son to a tee with no room to grow. But he loves them and says they are comfortable to walk in.
3.0,These were a lot smaller for my sons feet. He couldn't even put them on. But that's what you get when buying on line with out trying them on.
2.0,"too rough, can wear it a few hours only."
5.0,For an active 10 year old.  He loves them!  Arch support not as important and ability to wear all day is different from adult requirements.
5.0,I was looking for a comfortable pair of white slip on sneakers. These sneaker are perfect comfortable to wear all day long. Went on vacation took them with me worn them just about the whole vacation. So if you want comfortable good quality sneaker buy these you won't be disappointed. Also they are a excellent price.
4.0,My daughter just loves these shoes
5.0,"Vans are my favorite shoe brand and I was nervous that these weren't authentic, but they definitely are!  These are overall great shoes!"
5.0,These are great shoes for me. There skateboard shoes. I do not skateboard. I work. As for arch support there basicly flat.
5.0,"Vans are not supposed to provide 'good arch support', so you guys might want to pull that option."
5.0,My daughter loved the shoes!!!
5.0,They are great looking and fit as per my typical shoe size.
5.0,I am happy with my shoes I wear them too much
5.0,Love them. Just what I wanted. Perfect!
4.0,"I like Vans, they're easy to slip on and off. Not great for arch support but comfortable and quiet."
5.0,"I have fallen in love with Vans again for the second time. I LOVE these. They aren't nearly as comfortable as my Skechers Go Walks, but they are still pretty comfortable and I can walk a long way in them."
5.0,The color is awesome on these vans! The size was perfect.
4.0,"Great shoe to slip on and go, which is exactly what I bought them for. I wouldn't recommend going on hikes with them, but they are comfortable for everyday use around town. A little narrow so those with wide feet should look elsewhere."
5.0,Like
5.0,"So cute, but fits kind of snug. It's better than being too loose, tho."
5.0,"as my son grows, I keep buying the next size. Best shoes ever!!"
5.0,Bought these for my son to wear to my nephew's wedding but he's had a hard time keeping them off his feet since they arrived. He absolutely loves them!
2.0,"Bought for my son. Ordered size 10 since that's what his previous ones were and they still fit. Received these and they were way too small, barely fit on foot. Returned these and went to store and bought same pair in a size 10  and fit perfectly. Not sure why but the online size 10 were much smaller."
5.0,"This product was just as advertised by the seller. This is an exact fit product, so there are no worries on the sizes. I purchased this for my daughter whom is entering her Junior year of high school. She actually picked the product out and ordered what she wanted, so it appeals to the younger generations! She is exceptionally happy with the fit of the shoes and the extreme comfort. She stated that there is no break-in period on the shoes and the shoes feel like her favorite sneakers, but more comfortable. She stated that the colors are just as advertised on the site and the shoes are exactly as depicted in the pictures. The white border of the soles are easily maintained with Clorox wipes to maintain the nice white appearance."
5.0,These shoes fit my son's narrow feet very well and are perfect for casual wear. He likes the checkered pattern and will wear them for school.
5.0,"I love my Vans. I've been wearing this brand for years. This particular pair are a little tight across my arch but I have high arches so keep that in mind. All in all, another great pair of shoes."
5.0,Awsome shoes---much more comfortable than expected!
4.0,Purchased this for my significant other because he's been wanting an all black pair of Vans. So I bought this to add to his collection. He likes the fit and can wear them all day with just about any outfit.
4.0,"Rubs a bit more in the heel than the previous pair of Vans of this same type--they didn't need any breaking in, and this new pair does seem to need a breaking in period. That might vary by color choice or even individual pair of shoes though, as it is a subtle difference. I am just disappointed because they are not as comfy immediately as my previous pair. However, overall they seem fine, and the fit is good."
2.0,Bought a half size bigger than I need and still tight. Very disappointed.
4.0,"I love these shoes, my 5th pair in the last few years and I wear the others out completely.  They are perfect for easy walks and slipping on and off quickly for dog walks. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that they don't have any arch support to speak of, and take some time to wear in to make them totally comfortable.  But I will always buy them, love the colors."

4.0,"These are so cute and fit great, although they did require a bit of a breaking-in period, but I've found that to be the case with this style of Vans in the past, so I expected it.  Get a lot of compliments on them."
5.0,These were such a good price and not knock offs! They're beautiful and go with so many things. Great go to shoe purchase. 2nd pair I've owned.
5.0,I've been wearing vans since I was 10 years old and I'm now 35.  I love the fact they haven't changed at all as far a basic design. I have old school blue. They fit true to size. The all white of course is hard to always keep clean but I use the vans cleaner and they good as new.
5.0,I love wearing Vans.  They are good for everyday and exercising.
5.0,"Star Wars Vans, have to love them no matter what!!"
3.0,I like Vans. I like wearing slip-on shoes. These particular pair run a little small.
4.0,The shoe is cool it does run a tad small I am a true womans 8 I should of ordered an 8.5 but with no socks there fine. I will just be sure to order my next pair up a half size. My package was way late but it wasn't Amazon.com  it was UPS  that was a pain in the butt!...
2.0,Had to by shoe stretchers.
5.0,"SUPER CUTE!!!! I think I'm going to love these.  The bronze color is a little darker than in the picture, which I was hoping.  I am just tickled pink with these shoes.  As one of the other reviewers said ""Hot Damn these are cute!!""  They sure are.  I wear a ladies 8 1/2 mostly and got the mens 6, and they are perfect.  They are mens shoes, so they won't fit like a womans shoe, you cant exect that they would fit like a womans shoe. I am perfectly happy with this purchase and hope to keep my teenage daughter away from them as her feet have caught up with mine."
1.0,Order one size larger and was still to small.
5.0,Fits just like they did when I was young
4.0,I have to send them back:( they r too small but I own several pair and I love them!!
5.0,My son loves these shoes.
5.0,AMAZING FREAKING GET THEM
5.0,They have great arch support. I'm 36 yrs old and these are easy to slip on and comfortable to wear all day.
4.0,I bought these to make them into a pair of tye die shoes. The shoes and the shoe box came in unharmed. When I tried on the shoes it turned out I couldn't really wear them with socks. But since I plan to use these for the summer I saw no problem with that at all.
3.0,They are light and can be worn with anything practically.
4.0,I like these black shoes.
5.0,"My grandson loves them. He is a bit difficult about putting on shoes, does not like the hassle of laces etc. so prefers slip-on. He is ready to go now with his Vans on and a smile on his face (and ours)."
5.0,Satisfied customer
4.0,"Never wore slip-ons as a daily shoe, having said that these are fantastic. Very clean, minimalist look to them with no BS; these are just simple slip-ons. Comfortable as well but I had to had some thin insoles because Vans skimp out on theirs. Definitely gonna buy again when these wear out."
5.0,"my every day shoes in the warmer months. Buying them about once a year as they see a good amount of use.
Very comfortable shoe."
5.0,"Vans.
Been wearing them for 32 years. from the beaches of California to the streets of D.C. even the canyons of Zion, Red Rock and North Rim.
I know they start a little tight, but stretch perfectly.
Great for Hacky Sack, summer days at the beach... and for causing new and interesting aromas when worn without socks, heheheh.
I wear 10.5 US Mens... these fit as expected. Always they start a bit snug. I wear them a few hours at a time until they stretch and get a little torn here and there.
Funny thing is, there is no real arch support in these things - and they only come in one width that I know of - and of course, I wear at least an E width in boots - and I have arches that rival any bridge... but they never make my feet hurt...?
.Only 5 stars for now..."
5.0,"After months of wear, my hubby reports these are still his faves !!!  Have held up very well and super comfy"
5.0,Love these shoes.
5.0,Very fast shipping! Love the Van's slip on sneaks. They are really comfortable and I wear them all day at work.
5.0,Great fit
5.0,Fit was perfect. I'm a women's size 10 and used the conversion to order a men's size. I may order them again in a different color!
5.0,Love them
5.0,GREAT COMF
5.0,Love these shoes!!! They look great and are comfortable. I have a really wide foot so there is some squeezing to get into them but they are stretching out now since I wear them all the time and are getting easier to put on. Great shoes.
1.0,Not what I expected. Not even white in color
4.0,"These were a gift, she loves them!"
4.0,I'd buy this pair but in one size larger
5.0,Work great.  Fast delivery.
5.0,Perfect fit. Very comfortable.  Well made.  No problems thus far.
5.0,Really nice pair of shoes. I bought them for an 80s retro party and love wearing them.
5.0,I have black leather Vans and now the gray canvas.  I LOVE them both.. I will buy more. Very comfortable.  Not necessary to break in.  Well made.  I recommend highly. Canvas shoes are true to size.  The leather--get a half size smaller.
5.0,"I'm not sure about the arch support. Vans to be fairly wide and flat shoes, but man are they comfortable. I love them. I need to order some Vans lace-ups."
5.0,Should've purchased every single color/design available!!!  But the sizes were a bit confusing-which was totally MY BAD!  So comfy. Rock em with the proper socks though. Just sayin.
1.0,"The first problem is the sizing of these shoes. I wear a mens size 9.5 M, I ordered a mens 10 M expecting to get a little extra room. What I got instead was a shoe that was more in line with a size 7 narrow. I could not even fit my toes in the opening. The shoe is clearly stamped 10M, definitely a mis-sizing. The other problem had to do with the quality of the shoe's upper part. The canvas used is very thin and flimsy feeling. Also the seams were all ragged and unfinished on the inside.  I returned them immediately and will not be considering Vans in the future. A total disappointment."
2.0,I've worn them and they are too small.
4.0,Fit per
2.0,"They were too narrow for my feet, and for some reason, Vans doesn't offer a wide. I was really dissatisfied and disappointed."
4.0,"They look great feel good, but they are thin on the bottom so I'm sure I'll go threw these fast if I wear them daily.  Other then that I really like then them and would definitely order another pair"
5.0,"Comfortable, yet to skate in."
5.0,"My son was extremely pleased overall with the shoe, just perfect!!!!!"
4.0,"shoes are great, but should get a half size larger.  typically i'm a 10 and should have ordered a 10.5"
5.0,"I wear them with a little half insole and they are perfect.  Have worn VANS slip ons all my life and for me-  they fit MY foot well-  HIGH instep and arch, wider foot in front and narrow heel.  PLUS-  I love the support - thicker soles are better for my foot, esp. after having had surgery on one of my toes.  PLUS-  i love the color.  As a 50 yr. old woman-  I really can't wear the checks and all the wild print like I used to."
5.0,"I love these shoes, i wear them to work. I walk around for the full 8 hours."
3.0,I bought one size larger because I know vans run small but they still feel like there two sizes small.. I love vans been wearing them my whole life but if you get these and have a wide foot I would order three sizes bigger then you foot size at least
3.0,To small feels like there two sizes under what I wear
5.0,Thankyou love my new vans !
4.0,love these things and still rocking them.  many compliments from all walks of life on these shoes.  classic.
4.0,Expectations met.
4.0,"Love these shoes, but too small."
5.0,Love these shoes. Wore them when I was a teenager and they fit just like I remembered. If you get the white ones I suggest that you get scotch guard and spray them before you wear them if you want to keep the brite white look!  I plan on getting another pair in black...these shoes rock and fit true to size! 
3.0,Just the right fit.
5.0,Boyfriend likes them alot. Works for his work
5.0,My son loves his Vans. This first great!
5.0,"I haven't worn them all day, but have worn them for a few hours at a time with no problem. (walking almost the entire time) Definitely a bright white!"
4.0,Comfortable fit
5.0,I LOVE THEM!!!
5.0,Love these! They work great with no show socks. I wanted a pair of casual black slip-ons and these are comfortable and cute! I got a size 5.5 (mens) because I wear a 7 in womens with thin or no socks.
4.0,"They are your standard Vans Slip on shoes. They run in the same sizes as my Converse, so they fit well. I tried a pair on in the stores thinking I would wear a 7.5 as that is what I would wear in my tennis shoes, but that was a bit too big and a 6.5 was just too small. The 7 that I got fit perfectly.

My left shoe has something like a flaw where the ball of my foot touches when I step down. It's not like that in the right, so I am assuming it's just a small flaw, but it's not a big deal. I am sure over time I won't eel this anymore.

Like Converse, I cannot wear shoes like this for too long. If I were going to walk for a long time I would not wear these shoes, but I have trouble wearing shoes with little support.

I do like them though! (Don't mind the cat hair in my photos, I can't bring anything home without cat hair clinging to it instantly as I bring it in!)"
5.0,"I wear these shoes just about everyday; I wear them to work and when I'm just hanging out. They're as comfortable as you would expect Vans to be, which depending on what you're doing is either pretty comfortable, or absolutely not comfortable. They don't have much in the way of arch support, but just sitting at a desk, walking around, or doing light manual work isn't bad at all. The inside soles wear out pretty quickly so I replace these probably 1-2 times every 2 years."
5.0,"I love vans, they are super cute and comfy."
5.0,Feels good and looks good
5.0,Bought these for my 50 yr. old husband and he loves them. Very comfy for many hours but support not so good. Easy to sleep on /off. and good color.
4.0,Stylish and comfortable casual slip-on.
5.0,"Classic old school checkered vans like I wore in the 80's. These are still totally rad, fit great super comfortable."
1.0,Had to return these they didn't fit
5.0,None
4.0,These are reasonably comfortable and I like the style. I would give them 5 stars if the insole was removable so that you could use one with a bit more arch support/cushioning.
5.0,These are great shoes but tend to run small. My son usually wears an 11 in all other shoes but needs at least a 12 for them to fit.
5.0,These are nice shoes.
5.0,Great looking shoes.
5.0,"Fast delivery, as advertised. Good product."
5.0,Black on black. Very hot
5.0,"These are just what I'd hoped for. I thought they'd have a thicker foot bed, but it's ok. The fit is really perfect, and looks good with barefeet or socks."
4.0,"Make my feet sweat for some reason...not very breathable, but very comfortable and good quality."
5.0, perfect..
3.0,Fit just right straight out of the box.
5.0,Nice fit
5.0,They r great
5.0,Very good product!
5.0,"I've only had these shoes on for an hour, and I already know they're one of the MOST comfortable shoes I've ever worn! I'm a volunteer in a hospital, and these are going to be the shoes I wear. They look great too!"
5.0,My son loved these shoes
5.0,"Fit like a glove, a Uzi wielding Kung fu trained spider monkey wearing a glove that is. Bought these bad boys so I would have some slip on shoes while I rehab my knee, don't ask how I injured my knee because it was most definitely not from an epic break dance battle with a Shaolin monk or was it?..., and my god did I get so much more. Upon slipping on these slippery delights not only did my sweet little toesie woesies slip away to a wonderland of comfort and bliss but my knee was almost intaniously better. I am now not only able to run, jump, and fly higher than I could ever before but I am also able to speak with animals and drink scolding hot beverages without the slightest burn to my mouth. I highly recommend these bad larrys to any person that calls themselves a true expert on the art of relaxation. 5 stars"
5.0,love em
5.0,"Only footwear I've ever worn and gotten complements on.  Everyone, including me, love them."
4.0,"they look very nice, and fits as expected but I cannot wear these without sock because the leather part on the back will rub against the back of my foot and very quickly will take skin off. Also i have a high arch so wear them with insoles."
5.0,Bought these as a gift for my husband; he loves them and gets many compliments.  Good fit and well made
5.0,"I'm normally a Regular size ten in Men's. This is a little right near the pinky toe, once I wore the shoes they stretched a little, but I suggest getting the WIDE version if you can't or don't want to go up a half size."
5.0,"Great product, my second pair."
5.0,Love the shoe fit perfect look great I'll b buying another pair for sure .
5.0,As good as they look
3.0,"Love Vans, but I get a hole in the toe area within just 2 or 3 months of receiving them!"
5.0,"It seems like Vans run a little small in general, but I have another pair of the slip ons in the same size and they were just a bit longer. I will order a half size larger next time. Love the shoes though"
5.0,"Comfortable, versatile, and overall exactly wat I needed!"
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"Colors vibrant. Fit is as expected. Comfortable for me for casual wear but not fo a lot of walking due to no arch support.  Normally, I wear a 7.5 w in women's shoes."
5.0,"My feet are a little wide. Despite that, after some wear, these shoes are amazing. Would reccomend."
5.0,Great
5.0,I love vans!
5.0,Very satisfied
5.0,thanks
5.0,"love these shoes - tons of compliments, can wear all day!"
5.0,Amazing
5.0,comfy and cool looking
4.0,"Vans are always comfy, if you haven't tried the brand give it a go. It's always my top brand of all day comfort kicks."
3.0,"I loved the shoes when I got them as I've always wanted a pair of Vans Slip On shoes. For some reason though after wearing them for only two months they started getting holes where my big toes are (and no I don't have crazy long toenails or anything), the backs of them broke down pretty quickly for being slip on shoes and the tread on the bottom wore fast."
5.0,"These shoes were too small for me, but I ended up giving them to my younger sister who is one size smaller than I am. It was my mistake, I ordered the wrong size, but the shoes were in pristine condition and I would definitely order from them again. I love checkered vans and they're pretty much the only shoes I wear. They're sturdy and last a very long time for a pair of shoes. My favorite shoes!!!"
5.0,They wear great!  My son loves them!
5.0,Perfect to put on when in a hurry.
4.0,They're Vans. Comfy shoes.
5.0,Fit perfectly and arrived on time
5.0,"In the last 15 years, I have never not owned a pair of Vans. The gray color is the same as the picture."
4.0,Vans are great
5.0,Just like the ones I buy at the Van's outlet store.
5.0,Great shoe. Wear them all the time. Very comfortable and wearing well.
5.0,"The only disappointment was that the shoes were obviously worn. And not repackaged properly.
But the was on the seller. Love my Vans!"
5.0,original vans classic fit the perfect shoe
5.0,"As a man named Daniel I had to buy these, and it was totally worth it."
5.0,Amazing shoes! Totally loved them!
5.0,"My favorite shoes right now, they go with almost everything"
5.0,I will wear vans forever. I have about 10 pair and can wear them comfortably all day with my little socks (so they don't get all nasty and smelly). I get shin splints from wearing flip flops so these are my main summer shoe.
5.0,"Awesome, dude!"
4.0,Run a little large. But I like them.
5.0,great shoes for gardening
5.0,"I've worn Vans for more years than i care to admit to, and these are just as durable, comfortable, and stylish as my first pair. I do have to order a half-size down for slip-ons (as opposed to Vans lace ups), but once you figure that out they fit fine."
5.0,I love these sneakers. Comfortable and classic.
4.0,"These shoes lasted for almost an entire school year (counting in the factors that I wore these every chance I could get and I treated these pretty roughy), which is very good for shoes I usually get (last 6 months). However, when these shoes started to wear out, the fabric on the stop started to rip until it created a hole (mid March). Of course I'm buying these shoes again since they work so well for my wide feet and my lifestyle."
1.0,Got a hole worn in above big toe after 3 months of light usage. Don't make em like they used to.
4.0,Nice sneaker.  Wish it had more arch support.
5.0,"Love them, but make sure you order a size up."
5.0,"Yes, like the black on black best"
5.0,I wore my last pair out after a dozen years. These are a replacement pair. I've always had a pair of checkered Vans in my life.
5.0,A+
5.0,"As always , super comfortable !!"
5.0,Loved it very happy
5.0,Love these shoes!
5.0,Gray was a nice color.
5.0,"The shoes are super cute, legit Vans, decent price- I paid $39 while they sold for $45+ elsewhere"
5.0,Exactly as described.
5.0,Ive been wearing vans for 10yrs+ as always super happy and I've wore these every day since I bought them. Extremely comfortable. I work 12 hr shift and I have flat feet and I have no problem with them.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for! They will be the perfect summertime kicks and will look less mom-ish than the keds I was wearing last summer.
5.0,Just right
5.0,Nice look!
3.0,Fits a little bit different than his last pair
4.0,My son absolutely loves the Vans that I bought him for his birthday. The white canvas is extremely stylish and cleans relatively easily. There have been no complaints of discomfort when wearing the shoes and the slip on design is very well made. The only reason I have given this a 4 star ration is due to the sole of the right shoe tearing after 4 months of wear. This should be expected when you wear a pair of shoes everyday though. Overall the shoes hold up very well and compliment any outfit.
2.0,not for me
5.0,"These are the real deal, I was nervous to buy shoes online since you can't try them on. I have bought these particular shoes before so, I decided to pull the trigger. They fit perfect are authentic Vans and are great slip on casual shoes last a long time. Be confident in buying these are classic shoes that are built for all day use."
5.0,great shoes
5.0,I actually just found out I ordered the wrong size months ago. And I let my shoes sit in the box till I decide to where them. Months year. Can't figure out how to exchange them? Or if possible.
4.0,"Nice shoes, but a little small. I ordered a half size up and wish I'd' gone up a whole size. Hopefully they will stretch a bit as they break in. If not, and I order another pair someday, I will go up another half size."
4.0,Great shoe.  Exactly what I expected.
5.0,fits well
4.0,"I need to wear them in a bit. They feel a touch snug on the tops of my feet, otherwise they're exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,I bit tight but still love them
3.0,"Vans fit were a little snug for a woman's size 6.  Bought them for my daughter and she loves them regardless.  By the time she breaks them in, they will be too small.  I would buy a larger size then 3.5 in boys next time."
5.0,Love them
5.0,I  bought the wrong size (too big) other than that they are perfect
4.0,My default shoe for almost 40 years!
1.0,"I am thoroughly disappointed! The picture shows the black leather slip-ons; however, the canvas slip-ons were delivered. Before ordering, I even double checked that the canvas version were a separate option that were labeled as such a s that the ones I ordered did in fact show a picture of the leather version. Bummer."
5.0,Got them quickly and my son loves them!
5.0,"Dayum Dari, back at it again with the black vans."
3.0,"I have a wide foot, so I could not even get these on.  There is nothing wrong with the shoe, I just couldn't get it on."
5.0,great shoes
5.0,"classic vans, never let you down."
5.0,Fit me well and a good work shoe in the warehouse. Would buy again.
3.0,Tight fit...narrow
5.0,Their holding up and look Hardy to play hard. Good fit and seller.  Thank you.
4.0,"a good pair of shoes,good to were all day!!"
1.0,Love the shoe! However wearing them 3 times they are following part. Very disappointed
2.0,"I ordered a regular size (as opposed to narrow or wide) and figured i would be okay, because I have very narrow feet, but I like some room in the tow box. The pair I received were INCREDIBLY difficult to get on because they were so narrow. I do not know that any amount of stretching these out will make them comfortable, and I'm super bummed about it."
5.0,So comfortable. Didn't need to break in at all. Love my new vans!
5.0,This is the best tennis shoe for comfort.  I love Vans shoes.  I intend on purchasing many more of these in different colors.
5.0,Received quickly. Just what he wanted.
5.0,"Perfect fit, perfect color. Love 'em!"
4.0,"Let me start by saying that I wear Authentics and/or Eras almost daily. I haven't had slip ons since I wore the checkered black and whites as a kid. Holy crap, the slip ons do not fit like either of the aforementioned shoes that I normally wear. I couldn't even get my feet into these. I can't give Vans a bad review, but I will say that these fit much smaller than other models."
5.0,Perfect fit! Love these shoes!
3.0,"The quality seems cheap for a van's product .  If you're a female and looking for something not too bulky then don't get these, because they are.  The color is creme not white.  I do like the color, however."
5.0,i bought the wrong size. apparently i am an 11 in vans.
1.0,The shoes are fine but I ordered a men's size 10 and a women's size 10 arrived instead.
5.0,"It was a gift for my granddaughter but I ordered the wrong size.
She was so happy with this gift....!!!!!"
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,"These always run a touch snug, so I know to always get them a half size bigger than most of my other shoes. Even then, a little snug, but after a few wears, they stretch to perfect fit."
5.0,"I am totally satisfied with this shoe, it is quite comfortable.  I would recommend to anyone.  The transaction was quite painless and service was impeccable."
5.0,They are Van's.
4.0,These are well constructed and look great.
4.0,Very comfy
5.0,Son loves them
5.0,"The look, comfort, and quality are all there. Love Vans."
4.0,"Graphics are real cool, i got a lot of compliments."
5.0,Love them!
5.0,"Great fit and very comfortable.  I wore them all day at work without any aches.  They were a little snug on top when initially getting them on, but got easier to put on with every wear."
5.0,"Vans are classics. I love these shoes and have for a very long time. I started wearing them in middle school and have been wearing them ever since, I'm 49 now."
5.0,Took a while to break in but I love them
5.0,Fit pretty good. Awesome shoes.
4.0,Comfy and great to wear with anything!
4.0,Awesome! My son loves them.
5.0,"Two thumbs up from my husband.  He will wear a pair until they are slap worn out, then get a new pair to start again."
5.0,love these
5.0,"Great look, fit perfectly"
5.0,I'v been wearing these shoes for years. I just ordered them for the fist time from Amazon. They are as exactly as I expected. I don't know how to answer the arch support question as that is up to the individual. The work great for me and they are awesome to wear while flying as they make taking shoes off and on in a hurry a breeze.
4.0,My son loves these. They look fabulous.
5.0,"For the last 2 years, I have only purchased Vans slip-ons for my work shoes. I wear them all day and evening.  I work for 11 hours a day and they are very comfortable.  I used to be fat and it was hard to tie my shoes, now I'm skinny and just lazy, I love these sneakers, they last 9-12 months and I'm not sure if I'll ever change from these."
3.0,"These Vans are men's sizes and they run very large and very wide. I had to return them. No half sizes and the '6' the supposed equivalent of a woman's '8', fit like a size 9."
5.0,My son put them out out of the box and has been wearing almost every day. Loves them.
5.0,Very good
2.0,"My wife asked for these shoes for her birthday... and being an obedient husband, I immediately bought them and put them away for her until her birthday arrived.  She was delighted that I got her just what she wanted, but the women's size 6.5 that she normally wears is a bit tight and she asked if I could exchange them for a size 7.  Unfortunately, it was just past the 30 days return policy.  Now she has a pair of shoes too small for her and it seems like there is nothing that I can do.  The shoes are unworn (other than just trying them on for size) and in the original packaging... I'm wondering if Amazon would be willing to make an exchange for the women's size 7 red checkerboard Vans Unisex Slip On Skate Shoes.
Please advise..
Thank you,
Curtis Barth"
5.0,Great slip on casual.
5.0,These are the only shoes I buy
5.0,"Always love these shoes, just takes a bit to break in and not get blasters on the back lol"
5.0,"A pair of classic black Vans. What do you really want me to say here? Good shoes are good, 10/10 would buy again."
5.0,"Flat shoes, so no arch support what so ever, but you cannot go wrong with the vans slip ons."
5.0,Love these!!
3.0,less than expected. ( shoe quality)
4.0,Love
4.0,"Really great quality. No tears or loose strings. Reliable buy.

Same expectations as other Vans shoes. Really liked the checkered design, matched nicely with black jeans. Package arrived in a timely matter and had no damage/flaws to the shoe."
5.0,my son wears these all day and loves them
5.0,I love these shoes and you cant beat the price!

5.0,"Great, just great"
4.0,Great shoe
5.0,Great shoes! Love 'em
5.0,"As with all Vans, and all shoes for that matter, they're a little stiff when you first get them and the heal of the shoe kind of gives you a blister. But they're stylish and comfortable once you wear them for a while. I've had all of my other pairs of Vans for 5+ years, so they are definitely quality!"
5.0,LOVE THEM
5.0,So comfortable. I love these shoes 
4.0,"I love these shoes, they are probably my 5th pair of vans slip ones, but for some reason my usual size is too small. I'm going to order a 1/2 size larger next time. ( i think its because i like to wear thick sox..)"
5.0,Damn Daniel back at it with the white vans damn Daniel
5.0,Great shoe for a sleek look.
3.0,Ok

5.0,Damn!!Daniel!!
5.0,Perfect
2.0,"The Shoes itself is simple yet pretty, however, the shoes doesn't fit in my feet. But I bought a size 6 shoes of vans a month ago, and it really fits well how come this one came and disappoint me with a too narrow width."
5.0,Awesome shoes! Thank you 
4.0,I like this very much.  Comfy and they go with everything.  They did rub the back of my foot after a very long day of walking.  However the more I break them in the better.  I would get another pair.

5.0,My kid loves em and they fit great!
2.0,"love the shoe, just ordered the men's size and not the womens...can't find a womens 9 anywhere"
5.0,A great casual shoe.
5.0,Vans are a great shoe. Fit was perfect and the comfort was great.
5.0,Because vans mold to ur feet it's best to get a half size smaller in my opinion . Always a classic shoe. Love it
5.0,Their Vans....
5.0,Absolutely love them! Fit just as I thought they would (I went off of the size I already had). And they were the cheapest I had found them anywhere!
5.0,Perfect! Flawless shoes
4.0,"These fit a little tight, so I made sure to go half a size up - especially if you plan to wear thin socks with them. These are cool, comfy shoes (for the most part) and I have several pairs in different colors and designs."
4.0,he loves these as house slippers
4.0,"Really cool, color is a bit more grey than the picture. Sizing runs a shade small, but I expect them to loosen as I wear them."

5.0,"These shoes are awesome.  I had to send the first pair back because they fit a little small, but the size up replacements fit perfect and look cool as hell."
4.0,"It came as I expected. Color, size, delivery day all was fine. It was gift for my Jr. High niece and she loves to wear it at school and everywhere."
5.0,Luckily my husband already knew these shoes run about a half size too large! So make sure to order down!
5.0,Great quality and was true to size. Exactly as expected.
3.0,A little too small...
3.0,"I have wide feet, and I thought unisex/men's shoes would be wide enough (my feet aren't so wide I can't still find plenty of women's shoes--even heels--to wear). These pinched a little around the toes. I bought them to walk around in and be comfortable, but they're not, so now they just collect dust in my closet. They're good quality and look nice, though."
5.0,Exactly what I had expected fast shipping too!
5.0,"I read a few reviews saying these didn't fit great and weren't the real deal..... I'm confused about those bc mine are AWESOME and soooo comfortable. My new favs! Always wanted the check slip on vans. I'm going to order other colors too. GREAT price, lower than I've seen them anywhere else, quick shipping, quality product. THANKS!"

3.0,"i returned it. it was big and wide for female feet and the color was little different from the picture. not as expected.
Vendor deduct $10 something from the original amount that i didn't know prior to ordering the shoes.  i paid for shipping back ($10) and lost $10 for re-stocking fee or something.  I will not order anything unless i know the product 100%."

5.0,I got my regular size in vans and they came and they fit perfectly:)
4.0,Looks really nice

5.0,Awesome shoe. Fits great.
5.0,Great casual slip-ons!

5.0,Awesome skate shoes.

4.0,Love

5.0,"My golden retriever eat my daughter-in-laws Vans when she stayed with us.  I was very happy to be able to find the exact pair/size she had.  I can't speak to thee arch support, I didn't buy them for me."

5.0,Shipped very fast! In love with them. Get a 1/2 size smaller they run big. I wear a 10 in woman's and got a 9 1/2. Fit perfectly
5.0,"These shoes are great!! They seem to be pretty good everyday shoes, so that's nice. For some reason, they are very hard to get on, and when they are on my foot seems to slip in them, but it's not too bad."
5.0,I love these shoes.
5.0,"My son still loves these shoes
He buys a new pair and then wears them til they wear out, then buys another!!!"
5.0,"these shoes are amazing. they fit extremely comfortably and are a really nice color. I got them originally because I usually wear high top converse, which take forever to put on and tie, and wanted shoes that were cute and still easy to put on. these take two seconds to put on and are my new favorite pair of shoes!"
5.0,favorite shoes
4.0,my boy loves these shoes
3.0,I got these for my 14 year old son. He likes Vans but he won't wear these because they are too tight around his foot.
5.0,"These shoes feel great, and they are really comfortable to wear. I'm afraid to wear them all day in case I accidentally ruin them."
5.0,Its VANS
4.0,"Good Vans, little narrow for the size"
5.0,Very happy with products. Thanks
5.0,Great deal
5.0,Good service. Good fit. Good looks. Have had many of this style and many others as well. Love my classic checkerboard though. I'm very picky about my footwear especially with quality. I'll keep on buying these!  Cheers!
2.0,Sizing was way off
5.0,Good shoes
4.0,"I've been wearing these for years.  Great for commuting by bike, then wearing in the office.  (Casual office, that is.)"
3.0,I had to return these as they were too small. I think I just ordered the wrong size. They are a good looking shoe. I will try them in a larger size.
5.0,came as expected! i love these shoes (:
4.0,these shoes were a present & she liked the Present..it was a good buy
5.0,Great show
4.0,my son breaks them to easaly they last about 1 to to 2 months for him.
3.0,1/2 size to small. Sent them back.
5.0,"I purchased these for my 13 year old son.  This is his second pair.  He loves them.  The first pair were a size 8.5 that I bought him a year ago.  He was still wearing them as recently as a month ago, even though he now wears a size 10!  They were still fitting him comfortably because they were old and broken in.  He never complained about them hurting his feet.  But I decided to buy him the same pair in a size 10, and they are a perfect fit.  No complaints here.  Would highly recommend."
4.0,thank you
5.0,"I got the shoes as a gift for my brother and he loves them. Beautiful color, and he says they fit him well. He normally wears a size 12 and a half, the fans do not come in a size 12 and a half so I had to order a 13 but he said they fit just fine."
5.0,Great shoe thanks!
3.0,"The left shoe has a tighter/shorter fit than the right. I suppose it could be my feet, but if do this is the first time this has happened to me. I like the shoes, but as my first pair of Vans, I can't really give more than 3 stars. I was going to like them more."
5.0,"First pair of Vans for me. I am hooked for life, they are well worth the money."
5.0,Seems to be good quality. They were purchased as a CHRISTmas gift. Hopefully my daughter will be happy when she opens them!
5.0,Absolutely love them!  Fast delivery.  Would order again!
5.0,Excelente.
4.0,classic style and simple shoe.  my only complaint is there isn't alot of cushion in the sole.  long walks or spending long periods of time in these can leave my feet feeling sore (gel insoles or similar may help).  otherwise love them.
5.0,It's perfect
4.0,Purchased for my husband. They fit very well. He likes that they have arch supports. They also look nice with his jeans .
5.0,They nice
5.0,Love these shoes!
5.0,"These shoes are flat soled both inside and out and run towards narrow, but so do my feet, so they work for me! I love them! They are comfortable for running around all day. I will buy other colors in the future."
2.0,"Returned these as they were not comfortable to wear all day walking around in, even with some insoles."
5.0,Quality product as expected!  Bought these for my husband now our daughters want them also.
5.0,"Who doesn't love a good sneaker? These are some of the most comfortable sneakers that I have ever owned. They look great with something as simple as a pair of jeans, I have even worn them with a summer dress and they still looked great. Fit to size and can be worn all day with no trouble whatsoever. These are my go to shoes. Vans rock."
5.0,"They fit great, and arrived on time!"
4.0,I buy this shoe for my son who has Cerebral Palsy which causes problems with his gait. His foot doesn't strike the ground flat as is normal and he is unable to keep from dragging his toes as he takes a step. Because of this he quickly drags holes in the toes of the more expensive sneakers. The design if the sole and toe of the Van's  Skate is such that it lasts 2-3 times longer.
5.0,"I am a big big fan of the Vans classic slip-on checkerboard shoe.  This is my fourth pair in my life.  I have had an olive green and black checkerboard pair, a turquoise/sky blue and black checkerboard pair and a black and white checkerboard pair when I about 12 years old.  I wish they would keep making the classic colors and stop phasing them out.  I especially like the styling of the black webbing between the tongue and the sidewalls.  This is my first all black pair and I'm really liking them.  The first pair of shoes I've ever had that I actually want to stay clean and looking brand new.  I really hope that Vans keep these classics in production forever!  I've become so addicted to the ease of the slip-on shoe.
The only down side might be that they are a bit tight on my toes and a tad uncomfortable and stiff at the beginning.  I know from past experience though, that they break in very quickly then they feel very comfortable.  Just be warned, if you wear them everyday, especially skateboarding, they will wear out quickly and eventually will wear holes in the soles"
5.0,Husband loves his  old school vans!
4.0,Bought them for my son . He really likes them .
5.0,Good shoe...Vans usually are.  Shipment arrived quickly.
5.0,Great quality
5.0,"These are for my son, he loves them and wears them out. I went with a darker color so the dirt wouldn't show so fast."
4.0,Comfy and simple. I wear these all day. As I get older I am too lazy to tie my shoes! So I opted for these stylish slip ons. Vans is a long time favorite brand. Shoes fit as expected and comfortable.
5.0,"Have been living in California for 12 years now, but never owned a pair of Van's -- a California icon -- so I broke down and bought a pair.  Two things:  1.  Was amazed to find they came from Massachusetts!!  2.  Much better made than I expected."
5.0,Awesome.
5.0,I live in California and the shoes came from New Jersey in 3 Days on standard shipping! Fit perfectly and look great! Totally recommend!
5.0,Love these! Cheaper than regular but the real size
5.0,"Always a fan of the old school Vans slip ons,I just wonder why there doesn't seem to be as many patterns/designs to choose form these days? Anyways,always a good buy for 40-45 bucks tops. I'll usually wear them until they start to fall apart,then order a different pair before they're too far gone."
5.0,Perfect!!
5.0,gREAT THANKS
5.0,"Great shoes. Just what I wanted. Nothing more, nothing less."
5.0,good buy
5.0,great shoes
3.0,A bit small and narrow - would order a size 14 next time. No real arch support and to small to add my Spenco inserts. Will keep for around the house wear only
4.0,Love my vans...
5.0,"I got all white , true to size and perfect! Great packaging,  fast shipping , perfect fit !."
4.0,Love them! Perfect fit
5.0,I got these for my daughter and she loves them...shoes look good and fit well.
5.0,dont crouch
5.0,Fit my friend great. His health does not allow him to wear just any shoe!  This fit and wore well!
5.0,"Wore them for many hours to an outdoor concert that involved a lot of standing. I know when I don't think about how my feet are feeling, the shoes are very comfortable!"
4.0,"I have other identically sized vans in different colors and for some reason this one is tighter than the others. Could be quality control, could be this model?"
3.0,"Not bad shoes, but they did fall apart pretty fast."
4.0,"My son who is now wearing size men 7, loves these and so far it looks like it can survive his running, jumping, kicking and climbing feet!"
4.0,Would buy again.
5.0,"These Navy Vans slip on's are my favorite shoes. I am on my 3rd pair and each pair lasts me about a year. And I wear them every day. By the end of the year, the dark navy color has faded to a light blue/gray color, and there are some small wear holes on the sides of the canvas, however I would argue they look even better at the end of the year than when I first buy them! It takes a couple months of constant use to get that nice faded look. Also, I traveled through South America and Asia for 6 months last year, and these shoes I wore almost every day while traveling, hiking, with socks, without socks, with shorts, and pants, and they look good and feel good every time. I'm 18 and these are the perfect style. Great Buy and I can't recommend these enough! (I would add a picture of my two worn pairs, but alas I'm away from home at the moment..)"
4.0,Fit and feel great!
5.0,On my fifth pair...perfect.
4.0,"as described . Nice looking shoes , good shipping speed . Only thing , If I were to order again , I`d go a 1/2 size bigger next time Or maybe wear thin socks."
5.0,For my son.  He likes it.
4.0,my son wears them out quickly
1.0,Ordered a 4.5 got a 4
5.0,My son loves them!
5.0,My son loves them!
5.0,Fast shipping excellent product!
5.0,"I love these shoes. They're comfortable, fit snug and I wear them all day and don't get tired of having them on my feet. They also last for a while, as I wear them a lot and don't have to replace them often. Plus I save an extra 10 seconds a day by not having to tie them. All around win."
5.0,Love the Vans and shipping was good.
4.0,"Very comfortable and stylish. Although, they don't hold up quite as well as I would like them to"
5.0,"Perfect fit ,and in good condition to no damage around the package"
5.0,"These were a birthday gift to one of my close friends, he loved them so much he's thinking of getting another pair. I am glad I bought these for him"
3.0,Snug fit
5.0,great
5.0,Perfect fit is what my daughter told me
5.0,"Well-made, good-looking, durable & comfy!  My boyfriend loves these and he is super picky."
5.0,"my son loves these shoes, the size was just right, but he said they rub on his heal and may need to be broken in some"
5.0,My son normally wears 121/2 & 13 in shoes. This is the second pair I've ordered. He has a wide flat foot so I ordered 13. He loves them.
1.0,really uncomfortable.  No support.
5.0,"My son loves his Vans Shoes.  The fit is always good, and they are well made.  They are comfortable, wear well, and have some arch support which the cheaper brands don't have."
5.0,A classic wardrobe staple.
5.0,"Great Shoe.. MY one & Only copmlaint.. purchaes from Shoes.com, the Day after I bought them  they went down in Price.. & they did not honor the lower price"
5.0,"Wasn't expecting much from ordering shoes online with out trying them on, but they are awesome. Super comfy and wonderful. They are a little big, but when I wear thicker socks they fit fine."
4.0,The unbleached white appears to be a feint yellow.  I thought they would be a more natural color.  I wish I would have ordered the true bleached white.
5.0,Ran a little smaller than normal so I had to get them twice.
5.0,Love Vans.  Love Star Wars.  Having both just makes these shoes over awesome.
5.0,love them
4.0,great
1.0,Too small for women's 10. Returned.
5.0,love them
4.0,"I like the style, just wish they had a bit more support."
5.0,"I wasn't looking for shoes with arch support because i was getting skate shoes.
I recommend you buy half an inch size bigger then what your current size is because they'll fit a bit tight, unless you like that. There not super tight just a little tight.
They don't squeak or make any dumb noises
The inside of the shoe is white"
4.0,"These are really cute shoes, but they are a little hard to get on. I would order a half size larger if I were to order them again."
5.0,"Just what my grandson wanted, delivery was early!"
5.0,Boom shakka lakka
5.0,good
3.0,I need to return them. My nephew couldn't even wear them. My own fault  I had the wrong size.
1.0,"I have no idea what people see in these shoes. They seem alright at first, but they're basically just covered flip-flops, and you can walk about as far in them, which is to say barely at all. But at least flip-flops are good for the beach; these are just a flimsy and uncomfortable pair of shoes. Don't do it. Don't make your feet uncomfortable and give yourself blisters just because they look good. Get a real pair of sneakers that you can wear and do whatever you want in without ever having to worry about your feet. I regret this purchase and regret that in order to come to this conclusion I've already worn them outside too much to return them. I can't even decide whether I should put these in a donation bin or just throw them out, since I'm not sure that I want to inflict them on a needy person. 0 stars."
5.0,super comfortable shoes - no breaking in necessary.
2.0,I bought a 1/2 size bigger than normal - you need to get at least a full size larger.
3.0,"Nice shoes but they are a bit narrow, I had to really work to get my big wide foot in"
5.0,have flat feet so no arch is good otherwise very little arch support
5.0,I love this shoes. Fit as expected. I'll get my dad a pair soon.
5.0,These are great shoes for casual wear
5.0,Fast delivery. Thank you
4.0,They rub a little above the heel and will need to be broken in
3.0,"Vans are narrow, I had to buy the next size up to fit my feet."
1.0,Had to return these. They were too small. Couldn't even get them on my foot.
5.0,Great comfortable shoe.
5.0,Fit great sizing is the sane as lace up shoes and great comfort !
5.0,Quick and easy
5.0,Vans are a comfortable pair of shoe fit good and looks goods as well
4.0,Love 'em!
5.0,Great shoes. I had my doubts to be honest but overall I'm confident these shoes will be my favorite.
2.0,"The color was not as expected and it seems like Vans changed their product because I've been wearing this model for some years now, bought a few pairs of it throughout the years always the same size, and now the shoe is much harder to put on so it feels smaller, but then after it's on, the foot moves around in the shoe. A smaller size just won't go on because the opening is too narrow.
Returned the shoe and went to the store to try on a few more pairs and had the same problem. The salesperson said they're getting a lot of similar complaints lately.
I loved my Vans and i hope they fix up the model."
5.0,"Well made, great fit, very comfortable."
5.0,wore them till they wore out
5.0,Great quality shoes. Very comfortable!
5.0,Good product.
5.0,Great slip ons as always. Vans hasn't disappointed me yet.
5.0,"Vans stretch out over time to fit your foot customly. Decent shoe, will reorder."
5.0,I like these shoes. They are comfortable and seem to be made well.
2.0,"Too tight across the top of the foot. Very nice looking shoe. I had to pay to ship them back and a restocking fee, so I lost over $20."
5.0,Most comfortable shoes ever! Easy on easy off!
5.0,"Bought thes for my daughter for work. She is a Starbucks Barrista, and you know if you are on your feet all day what that's like. She just loves them and can work all day in them. She is quite happy."
4.0,"These definitely run small. My husband ordinarily wears a size 14 wide, so we ordered size 15. They fit a little snug, but still wearable."
5.0,Whit the wrong socks they are way too tight.
4.0,Perfect.  No issues.
5.0,Love them!
5.0,The shoes fit perfectly
5.0,"These are a comfortable, quality, slip-on shoe. Vans run about 1/2 size small for me, so when normally I'd get a 10.5, I get an 11 in Vans. If you know that, you'll be set."
5.0,Thank you
5.0,Love these. I wear them with Timberland boat shoe socks which don't show. Great quality.
5.0,"With Vans, there's a small difference between the sizing of shoes made for men and the complementary size of shoes made for women.  If you are aware of this slight discrepancy, the dependability of Vans makes ordering very easy.  ble.  A woman's shoe will be slightly roomier."
5.0,"Recipient wants more of the same, in various colors.  He is very pleased.  Others compliment him on how good they look and the comfort they appear to provide."
5.0,My third pair!
5.0,great shoe for my son...  he can wear to the pool or just around the house.  Easy to put on and very cool looking shoe.
3.0,"I love the style, but learned the hard way VAN's don't come in wide sizes. Only a very specific demographic can wear these shoes. I purchased another pair a size bigger. That fit better but still tight the first hour I wear them."
5.0,Gotta love some Vans mann
3.0,Nice shoe but my son can't wear it with socks. Narrow shoe.
4.0,buenos
5.0,"Never been disappointed with Vans. I wore them when I was a teen and now buy them for my son. He loves them! He wears them daily, even for sports and through the rain (scotch guard them). Love love love these on my son!"
4.0,Love them!  Scared to get them dirty though!
5.0,"I bought these shoes recently and I absolutely love them.  I am a huge Star Wars fan and they are great for everyday wear.  I was concerned about slip on shoes, but they fit really well."
5.0,Satisfactorily a pleasure.
5.0,Great product huge let down in shipping process courtesy of UPS.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Great purchase!
5.0,AWESOME
5.0,Cool and comfy :)
3.0,"wears out within months, but what do you expect from cheap vans?"
5.0,"Have bought three pairs of these for my husband.  He burns through them in about a year, but not because they are low quality....just because they are such a great everyday shoe.  He loves these!"
5.0,I put in gel intersoles but my son wheres them everyday and this is our 4th pair.
5.0,Excellent and comfortable as always
5.0,"I have had many pairs of Vans slip on shoes.  It usually takes at least a couple months to get them completely broken in, but once they are they are always my favorite leisure shoe.  The only downfall is the toe box is a bit narrow for wider feet.  However they will stretch out some after they are broke in."
1.0,"Good pricing. But too many irregular flaws in the shoes. This may be a vans thing. Or this may be where they ship all their non perfect shoes as an outlet.

UPDATE: gave it one more chance, and the right shoe was smaller than the left. Not buying from here anymore."
5.0,"My son, who is 10, loves these shoes!"
3.0,a little tight
5.0,Love Vans
5.0,"Very cute slip-on in a fun color. Fit as expected, shoe is accurately described. I would recommend this purchase"
5.0,I love these shoes but for long term use I need arch supports.  They are a great pair of shoes when going through security at the airport.
5.0,EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS
5.0,100% ok
4.0,Only slightly too long and just slightly narrow...my size is 11.5 long and  EEEE  width.
5.0,Awesome price! I love VANs..
4.0,I wear them to and from the pool. They are sturdy and do the job.
5.0,"Love these shoes, they're my favorite pair."
4.0,"My daughter and husband both love these shoes, so I usually end up buying several pairs throughout the year. If these get used on an infrequent (once or twice a week) basis, they stay looking pretty decent and last long enough. If you're the type that wants to wear these all the time, don't expect them to last more than a couple of months: by that time, the rubber soles will start to pull away and the shoes will look sloppy.

NOTE: I've started only buying these shoes when they are ""sold by Amazon,"" some of the ones from marketplace sellers seemed to be sized differently. Otherwise off to Zappos I go (also owned by Amazon)."
5.0,I've always been a huge fan of Van's shoes!  I'm an 80's kid and Van's was one of the big shoe brands during that era.  These shoes are very nostalgic for me and they fit great!
5.0,"I've had many many pairs of vans, solid shoe."
5.0,Love these shoes!
5.0,Just awesome!
5.0,Awesome love them
5.0,Awesome style for feet
4.0,"My only complaint about these shoes is that the left shoe is slightly more difficult to put on. The heel cup seems to be tighter or cut slightly differently. Once one, the shoe feels the same as the right, and there is no excessive rubbing or tightness around the heel. The left was a struggle to get on for a week or so, but it's getting easier. I have had several pair of the Vans classic slip-on, and I have never had this problem before. Oh, and the label tag at the back of the right show wasn't completely glued on because of the seam where the white band of the sole overlapped in the back. Not a major issue. I just put some super glue back there before I wore them around and it's been fine since. Maybe these were factory ""B' grade shoes, I dunno. Still, they fit well, I can wear them around without any problems, and they look good.

***They ask if these shoes provide good arch support. I said ""No"", because they aren't really built for that, probably due to the 'classic' design. I've had several pairs of this style shoe from Vans over the years and I don't expect them to provide the arch support of a sportier sneaker. That being said, they do provide more arch support than a pair of Chucks."
5.0,"I like the shoes for a work shoe, I did however have to put a support in them. But after that they are really comfortable."
5.0,exelente producto
5.0,My second pair and I love them!
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,"After wearing the shoes for a couple of days the stretched out nicely and not fit perfectly. Also, it's clear that these are not knock off Vans but the real deal."
5.0,good
5.0,great shoes. very comfortable and I wouldbuy them again
3.0,way too narrow.
5.0,The  shoes are just like the picture and fit as expected
5.0,as expected from vans!!
5.0,We bought these as a gift for our son and they are typical Vans quality-great!  He loves them and wears them daily.  They fit perfectly and just the same as Vans we bought at the Vans store.  We love Vans because they are sturdy and well made and all the kids love them.  These are particularly great because even for band performances he can get away with wearing these since they have black soles and no laces!  Prime membership ensured speedy delivery at no cost and since we got them on Amazon we saved a few bucks as well!
5.0,Great
3.0,"This is not the same shoe as th Vans Asher.  This is quite a bit smaller than the Asher, especially the width.  It is a very slim shoe."
5.0,Can't beat the comfort and style of the classic Vans slip on.
5.0,"These shoes are great , plus they arrived in perfect condition and in the agreed time. I recommend it."
5.0,Happy we found them
5.0,Vans are great for throwing on for work around the house.
3.0,Makes my foot look bigger than I would like but good shoes!
5.0,Silly me I ordered a 1/2 size too small....
3.0,it hurts
5.0,"Vans in my head
Vans on my feet
My sole is on the ground when I'm walking down the street 2, 3, 4
Don't wear no Doc Martens
Can't wear no Birkenstocks
Just a crummy old pair of chuka boots and a smelly old pair of socks"
5.0,very comfortable!
5.0,Love these.
5.0,"Love my new ""kicks""!"
3.0,"Shoes were dirty, there was ,marks that looked like glue on the sides"
5.0,Great
4.0,should have ordered 1 size bigger than normal
4.0,"Great look - Feels good on feet, already bought a back up pair."
1.0,"I wear a size ten and a half and they were way to small. instead of going through the hassle of returning them, I gave them to a friend and he wears a size nine and they fit him perfectly."
5.0,A+
5.0,I was surprised about how well these fit. The feel i have been looking for.
5.0,thank you on time fit just right
5.0,Great
5.0,"Classic shoe, this is my 20th pair of slip-ons and as soon as these wear out, I'll buy new ones."
1.0,I had to send them back the sizing was way to big
5.0,Great!
5.0,Everything Ok.
4.0,"I love the shoes! I was replacing another pair of slip ons that I wore off and on for 3 years. I finally wore a hole at the big toe spot so... I went for the men's 4.5 which equals women's 6. I want to give them 4 1/2 stars because the right shoe is ever so slightly tighter than the left,not the size but the top canvas. I will just wear it around the house to stretch it and that will be that. It certainly isn't something I'd return them over. Also I was thinking the posts that say to go up a half size, maybe they aren't used to the way slip on vans fit. They are not high on the top of your foot, that's why even no show.socks can be seen you need something in the shape of a ped.
Bottom line, my last pair lasted 3 years,you need to read what size you picked and they require a really really low sock or none at all and if you like the thicker socks, by all means go up a 1/2 size if you can."
3.0,Yay!
5.0,as expected
5.0,"I always buy these shoes, they are SO comfortable.  Easy on and easy off."
5.0,it fits perfectly
5.0,JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS. LOVE EM.
4.0,As good as expected
5.0,"I like these shoes because they are comfortable. Also, they are holding up well under constant use, so the quality has been good."
5.0,Perfect fit!
2.0,The size chart and actual size  are misleading. They don't fit and I went off the chart in the description.
5.0,a perfect gift!
5.0,Good
1.0,My son was so excited to receive these shoes for Christmas. After a couple of weeks of wear the soles have completely seperated from the canvas. He has worn vans for years and these did not hold up in quality compared to his previous pairs. We were very disappointed. I hope it was just a fluke in production.
4.0,Good fit!
5.0,"I've worked out on the elliptical in these, walked all over town, thrown them on to get to pilates or wherever. Easy, comfy, and the graphic of Darth shows you mean business."
5.0,"I love these shoes for work. I'm an LMT and spend a lot of time in my feet, and need to have freedom of movement. I bought my first pair in 2004, I have worn them everywhere. Daily wear, walking through the forest, walking creek beds, beaches, and rocks. Other than no longer being white and the ball of the foot part being thin now,  they are still on good shape. I tried several other work shoes and have found these to be the best. The insole is super comfy (I have medium arches) because they were designed as skate shoes. I fully recommend these well built shoes for any casual reason you're looking for them."
5.0,Cool shoes.
5.0,Love slip on vans. Great to get on and go
5.0,good product
5.0,I <3 my first VANS ever! I got a lot of compliments. People wanted to know where I bought them and for how much. They look expensive and they are SUPERCOMFYS!  I will buy them again. Awesome quality and value.
5.0,perfect
5.0,PERFECTION
5.0,My favorite shoes ever. So comfy.
5.0,"Love Vans have been wearing them for 5 years now. Fit as expected easy slip on to run dogs for a walk. Go great with shorts, jeans and khakis. Wear them every wear great price and free shipping with prime"
5.0,"I am a huge Star Wars nerd/fan and all of this Star Wars merchandise coming out with the new movie on the horizon is exciting to me.  I had never worn Vans before this summer when I found a pair of Metallica Vans slip ons on eBay.  I really liked the fit of the slip on shoes so when I saw this Star Wars pair I was sold.  They are very comfortable, have good support and feel better than most of my other athletic shoes.  The graphics are subtle yet you can definitely tell that is Darth Vader without making it look like a child's shoe.  I would recommend for the looks and the comfort."
1.0,"We have bought these several times before in the same size we always buy it in but this time they were too small... Not sure why, returned them was expensive to send back."
5.0,My son loves them. His second pair.
5.0,My son loves it

5.0,Came faster than expected no complaintat all
5.0,"My college-age son loves these shoes, but I can't find them in stores where I live. So, ordering is convenient, and they fit as expected."
2.0,:(
4.0,"It is narrow. Should have ordered a wide size. I bought them for my dad. He wanted slip on shoes. With his feet swelling, they were not wide enough. But, the shoes do fit my husband. He has a narrow foot."
5.0,Love the shoes!
1.0,ORDERED BLACK CHECKERED SHOES & GET BLACK SHOES

4.0,the shoe is not made out for wide feet people...my daughter couldn't even fit her foot in there...she liked the style but like i said the size she usually has is def not in those shoes...
5.0,Our entire family likes Vans shoes. The quality and the fit are great.
5.0,Fit perfect was exactly what we wanted
4.0,well its ok

5.0,Everything went as expected
5.0,Takes me back when I was a kid. Nice fit.
5.0,"My daughter moaned and groaned how she needed these sneakers soooo badly. I finely gave in, and she is so happy now! I didn't know at the time she was going to use them as a blank canvas for her Minecraft artwork. She painted a lovely scene one each sneaker. OMG! I guess I would've paid a lot more on ETSY! They do look great, and fit pretty well. They do seem to run a tiny bit large on her, but she's thrilled and that's okay with me!"
4.0,They fit as expected great show for the money
5.0,My daughter wears theses shoes with everything.
5.0,very good
5.0,They're super swag
4.0,Nice Pair Of Work Shoes & U Don't Have To Worry About Having To Tie Them. If You're A WOMAN Make Sure To Double Check Your Size Because These Are MEN Sizes. I Made A Mistake And Ordered 6 In Men Instead Of Women's But Still Fit Enough To Wear.
4.0,great product/
1.0,"When I  got the vans they were an off white, and looked dirty or worn."
4.0,"I like the shoe except it is tight to get on. I put shoe trees in them, maybe this will help."

4.0,Nice looking and comfortable shoes!!!
2.0,"To big, even going down a half size. Returned shoe."
5.0,"These are the best shoes ever, which is why they've been around forever.

I'm so lazy and my gut is getting big, so bending over to tie shoes and all that other shoe business is not the best part of my morning. My shower is for sure.

They're lightweight, relatively compact, crush/washable... great for frequent travel and being lazy, but ironically, not all that great for walking. They're comfortable yes, but supportive and tight fitting they are not.
Great for simply dicking around in, but don't go hiking or jogging in these. (I say that as if no one knew)
OBVI."
5.0,ok
5.0,Nice shoes color and style
5.0,My son likes the shoes...there's was nothing wrong when I got it.

5.0,Very comfortable
4.0,just right thanks
3.0,Everything was good except they were a little bit smaller than usual. I would suggest getting 1/2 or 1 size bigger than usual.
5.0,Fast shipping perfect quality fit as expected. If you love Vans than you will love these shoes I will buy more I am Sure!
5.0,Really like the way they fit.  So durable and comfortable.  Easy to slip on and take off.  No problem to clean either.  Personally have no complaints and like the look.
4.0,"Great for both lounging, travel and just being casual"
5.0,And they fit like vans.
3.0,I ordered a size 9.5 since I thought the 9 felt snug...the 9.5 was too large. I went with a size 9 in the end.
5.0,My son loves them. It's hard to buy shoes for my teenager but I can't go wrong with Vans.
5.0,I love these as does everyone who sees me in them!
2.0,I ordered black and receive red w/white...:0(
5.0,Received in great condition.
4.0,"The size 13 did not fit my son how usually wears a 13 in most other shoes, but fit my husband well and he wears a size 11....go figure.  My husband like them, and says that they are very comfortable to wear."
5.0,"As described, quick delivery"
4.0,Great shoes!
5.0,"Unfortunately an 8 1/2 was too small for my teenage son.  I thought I would wear them, but they are too large for a lady 8 1/2.  It's frustrating.  I'm not good with returning so I will find someone who wants them."
5.0,Fit great and fast shipping
4.0,My forth pair. I keep wearing them out.
1.0,"sent them back, terrible experence"
5.0,off the wall
5.0,Perfect. Love them!
5.0,"Great quality, fast!"
5.0,Worth every penny
4.0,Very good shoe though be careful as I think Vans may manufacture their shoes slightly narrower than most other shoes. Nice on length though.
3.0,Too wide in the heel -- too little arch.
5.0,Great fitting shoes
5.0,Nice shoe
4.0,My son loved them
5.0,good!
5.0,simply Love it
5.0,Comfy and cool!
4.0,"i bought this for my son because he love brand stuff and needed a pair of shoes for school and because he did excellent in his exams i bought for him. The size is perfect and the black is pretty, this shoes is the actual brand and no imitation so i am please with the purchase. This is a good buy although it was a bit pricey."
4.0,"My husband doesn't like to tie shoes and would rather wear his slippah everywhere. Hey, he's from Hawaii. He hates wearing shoes and he hates shopping. If he isn't wearing his black thick flip flops, he's wearing runners and he rarely runs.

He's held on to the his last dress up shoes, but even shoe polish won't hide all the cracks.

So I got him these. They are comfortable. They don't look to preppy (why we avoided loafers). They go easily from dressy casual in SoCal or Hawaii, to dressy mingling with Oscar-nominated actors/directors. The shoes have a good grip for slippery surfaces (their only drawback being they won't make good dance shoes for East Coast Swing or Tango).

These shoes convinced us to become fans of Vans. I now have Vans in my closet as well."
1.0,no me quedoo spanish venezulea.
5.0,perfect fit
5.0,"These Vans (CLASSIC SLIP-ON SKATE SHOES, Black/Black) fit just as expected. The quality is top-notch, as most would expect from Vans. I have been wearing this particular pair every day since I got them (several weeks ago).
They are quite comfortable. However, one thing I suggest is getting a nice, quality pair of insoles. I've got the BLUE insoles from Superfeet (found here on Amazon)."
5.0,"The product is exactly what i ordered, I already had this model and this is what i expected.
It fit perfectly ed it looks great.
I saw some bad report but i can assure that for me the service and the product are perfect."
5.0,Another product i bought for my teenager at his request and he is loving these shoes! plus they are super cute!
3.0,shoe is not wide enough does not feel like a D width
5.0,Always buy Vans love the shoes quick delivery got what I expected
5.0,Shipped on time and fit. Good job!!!!
5.0,Excellent product
5.0,Love the shoes.. Fit perfect and arrived in two days
5.0,fit like a glove.
1.0,These ran a half size small. Had to return them.
5.0,"thx to seller,it'perfect fit for my daughters"
5.0,"These are my very first pair of slip on Vans, I'm wearing them tomorrow for my 22nd birthday and I have to say I tested them and they fit snug on both feet. I would gladly buy more shoe's from the seller."
5.0,"Very good seller, item as described"
5.0,Just what he wanted
5.0,I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. Great price too and shipped fast!
4.0,because they were good
3.0,"Can't place a super feet foot support inside with the sox I wear
it's too tight. I bought 1/2 size larger, yet still not enough room."
4.0,"I wore Vans regularly from about age 12 through college, then lost track of them after moving to the East Coast.  I always found Off The Walls very comfortable and relatively long lasting for canvas shoes.  Since I'm more of a geezer these days I opted for basic black instead of my old Jeff Spicoli checks.

These fit a little small from what I remember, and the construction feels different from Vans two decades ago.  It's to be expected.  I've been wearing these for a couple weeks and so far they wear fine.  I hope they last a long time, but after all they really are canvas boat shoes and the uppers won't last as long as leather."
5.0,Fit perfect. Fast shipping. Love em. Thanks
5.0,Comfy slip on shoes. Great product!
5.0,he loved
5.0,"He loved theses shoes, they were comfortable n fit perfectly!"
1.0,For the last 20 years I've worn size 10 shoes.  I couldn't even begin to put my foot into these.  Now I have ti go through the hassle of returning them.  I will never buy shoes online again.
4.0,After wearing these shoes for a few days they fit great now.
5.0,I love um!
5.0,I should have purchased these sooner.
5.0,Love them
5.0,"These are a replacement for another pair of Van slip ons. Hopefully, they'll wear as well. Look the same quality workmanship."
4.0,"The shoe fits a little tight for my foot, and I would like a little more room around the toes, but I do like the shoe for the style and throwback to classic Vans style."
4.0,"Believe it or not I've actually hurt my back several times while bending over tying my shoes, these slip-on's solve the problem and they are very comfortable seem to hold up well."
5.0,What's not to like? Classic Vans slip-ons. Just what you'd expect. If you need arch support however-not your cup of tea.
2.0,"I am a size 7 in every shoe that I own. The inside of this sneaker even says ""women's 7"", but yet I couldn't even get my foot into it. It fit my grandmother who is a size 6. If you buy these, get them a size bigger. Huge disappointment. The material seemed cheaper for some reason too. I bought a new pair at a real vans store and a size 7 fit perfectly and was quality material. I suggest going to a real vans store to buy these."
2.0,"The Vans classic slip on shoes are designed for long, low arch narrow feet.  If you have a high arch or sometimes order up a half size for width, steer clear of these shoes.  I wore them for a couple hours hoping they might stretch out a bit, but ultimately, they did not, and they were both tight and uncomfortable because what minimal arch support existed was in the wrong place.

If you have long, narrow feet, give them a try - they probably fit to size.  Otherwise, don't bother."
5.0,"I love my new vans. The fit was perfect. The delivery was great, and you can't beat the price anywhere. I looked all over the for these being that it's June I couldn't find the black ones at the mall, but they were available on the vans site but at a higher price plus shipping and tax. So I can say I'm very statisfied with my purchase. My vans were true to size."
5.0,"Size is as advertised, well made. They are comfortable and easy to put on and take off. I love them. I would order from this supplier again."
5.0,my male hairdresser really wanted these when he saw me unbox them for my son.  A teenage dream style.  Good for boys and cute but a bit on the wide side for girl feet.
5.0,this has been a staple wardrobe item since I was old enough to walk. perfect for a night out on the town or simply going outside to get the morning paper.what more can I say...
4.0,Bought a pair of Vans at a discount store one year and haven't got any other brand since!  They wear well and can get 3-4 summers out of them!
2.0,"Wrong size sent, returning for refund but correct size not available.
My son is very disappointed.
Hoping to find correct size soon."
1.0,The description was totally wrong i always buy on amazon and is the first time i got disapointed with my purchase it said 8.5 women and when i got it it was men size
4.0,"I was expecting navy blue, but they were more of a royal blue.they  fit as expected. nice sneaker. i would recommend"
5.0,"I love my new slip on classic Van's sneakers..

These are very comfortable and I chose them because I like the look and style of them.  It was a no-brainer to buy these sneakers, and I would buy them again..so far no problems!"
4.0,"These are great! Very comfortable and stylish for a male or female. These shoes fit true to size and won't hurt your feet after extended wear. My only complaint is that initially throughout the breaking in process, they did rub my heel and cause a slight blister. Once they were broken in, I did not continue to have this problem. SPRAY THESE WITH SCOTCH GUARD OR SOMETHING SIMILAR BEFORE YOU WEAR THEM! Sorry for yelling, but I can't stress this enough, they are very white and as such they will stain."
5.0,"Fit as expected because I already have the same pair of shoes, but not all of vans models fit the same."
5.0,"Awesome shoes, first pair of vans. Now I know how they feel and look I want more, the slip ons are the way to go"
5.0,"I got these to wear with shorts for the summer and onboard my sailboat.  They seem like they're going to be perfect, but I just got them and haven't worn them yet.  Upon trying on, they fit as expected and look great!"
5.0,"If you want a pair of Vans and you don't want to think too hard about it, just get these. They're always a little tight the first couple days but loosen up pretty fast."
5.0,Bought these as a gift for my god son. I had an exact pair when i was his age and loved them. I was a rocker and still am at heart. They are soooooo coool and I was stoked that he felt the same way about them.
5.0,If you are into old school vans then you need to get this. We love to wear vans in our family and we love to shop on amazon for them because the discount mall has them over priced by at least $15.
5.0,"I searched just about everywhere for these Vans and finally found them here. I bought these for my extremely picky son, who was desparately wanting this specific pair. He loves these! They fit perfectly! I'm not sure he has taken them off since they were delivered. This mama is one elated customer!!"
4.0,"I know the shoes are unisex, which makes them a little wider than a typically womens shoe. She looks and feels great."
1.0,"my son received a diferent color he choose the classic as the picture .
instead he received blue color nothing related."
2.0,I was looking for a pair of shoes easy to slip on and off.  I ordered a half size larger than.  My feet are a little swollen so I thought the shoes would streach out if I wore tem a little so I foolish wore them outside and bang!  They did not strech out and they gave me the biggest insult I could ever get.  My feet sweat in the shoes and they stink.  In the last 45 years I have never had shoes that made my feet sweat so these shoes go in the trash dump;.n I normal wear and they came back to tight and just  long enough  Don't know how these sentences got switched around ..
5.0,I love these vans - they are comfortable and they look very sharp. Sizing was correct and I am pleased with the results. The shipping was handled well. Solid black vans can be very hard to locate so Amazon is a great choice for purchase. I would recommend that you buy two pair - one for everyday and one to keep for days when you are dressing up.
4.0,Came in great condition!  Just fits a little too tight :c should probably order it 1/2 a size bigger. Instead of 7 go 7 1/2
3.0,"My son only wears Vans and I have purchased numerous pairs of vans over the years. These are nice shoes, but may not be authentic Vans. They are not true to size with store bought vans. They run 1.5 size too small. I ordered a size 5 and they are too small. My son wears a size 4. The size is off by 1-2 size too small."
5.0,"My son loves this shoe brand and style. I had not bought this exact shoe because I was skeptical about the idea that Amazon was out of the men's size 9.5, yet had the W11.0/M9.5. Double checking on the Vans website, helped me to feel comfortable as they sell this shoe with this same sizing on their site. Perfect fit, exactly as the last time we ordered this style/color directly from Vans. The only difference, the reduced price that amazon offers. Great purchase!...Love these!"
2.0,size 10 is normal for me and these did not fit at all. Otherwise they seemed like a good shoe.
5.0,"Great look for spring and summer! I love the white. I also have the black. Not much arch support, but insole are possible."
5.0,Very comfortable. Looks good with jeans or any casual clothing. I am very satisfied with them. I definitely recommend these shoes!
5.0,"I love slip ons, so i always have to have a pair
These are the same as the ones at the vans store but less expensive
I'll be buying more from here in the future"
5.0,They started out a bit snug but soon were just perfect. Look great and had a lot of people ask where I got them.
4.0,"Really comfortable and fits a bit small, so I ordered a size bigger which is perfect.  They're narrower than I expected, but still fit good.  I still like my Crocs hover which may be a direct rip off of these shoes, but more comfortable.  They aren't made anymore.  I guess Vans wins.  Vans are really good even for people like me who never skated.  I'm such a poseur."
5.0,"I decided to start buying shoes that are not made with leather or suede. It is not easy to find good looking, contemporary shoes without leather. These are cool, comfortable and lasted a year of heavy use."
5.0,I have always loved Vans slip ons and wanted to try the charcoal grey. I'm very happy with the purchase.
4.0,"...in my head
Vans...on my feet
my sole is on the ground and I'm walking down the street
2...3...4...
Don't wear no Doc Martins, don't wear no Birkenstocks
just a crummy old pair of Chukka boots and a sweaty old pair of socks"
5.0,So apparently these aren't just for boys.  My daughter wanted some for her 14th birthday and absolutely LOVES them.  Who knew? She said they are very comfortable and fit perfectly.
5.0,They always fit perfect- my son loves them and wearss them everyday.  I will always but vans for him! :-)
4.0,9.5 fit better with thick socks these are a little tight. Not to bad but I wouldn't wear them all day
5.0,"These are great to wear at work (IT, lots of walking), drumming and out on the weekends. Have been buying knockoffs for years and finally stepped up to the real deal."
5.0,"These shoes are perfect.  I can wear them in the winter with socks under pants, or with dresses in the summer.  They're so cheap, Ibuy them in bulk.  When they get dirty I just throw them out.  They can be dressed up or down.  And they're light enough to travel with."
5.0,Your classic Van's. That says it. They fit like the classic and look as sharp as ever. Bought them for my groomsmen for my wedding and they all love them.
5.0,Everything I've ordered so far has met my expectations. I will continue ordering from Amazon. Good quality stuff and good products my kids enjoy it even more!!!
5.0,"I don't wear shoes in my house, so slip on sneakers are great, especially if they are a classic.  These are also amazingly comfortable.  My feet are a bit wide, and these shoes are perfect."
5.0,"Just as I expected, no complaints. Nice item for the price and just like it looks in the photo !"
5.0,This was a great surprise for my honey.  He loves his Vans and needed a new pair for years.  Great fit.
2.0,"For someone with narrow feet, it's not for you. Overall, I didn't like the fabric and the lack of comfort."
5.0,"Great item - fits perfectly, comfortable, looks nice. This is exactly what my son wanted but couldn't find in local stores."
5.0,It's a good buy the vans slip-on shoesI like the vans too and the only thing is the size that I tightened a bit but all well
2.0,"Hello Amazon I received the pair of shoes, but i need a number 5 size, and the pair of shoes has a default in their sole, it can't be used, because is like bad made. I want to know how can I received a good pair of shoes. And also, the shoes  are for women and i asked for mens shoes.

Thank you and let me know how we are going to solve that problem and what can I do to received my pair of shoes"
4.0,"They are over all a great looking shoe, Seem a bit hard to get on as there is no stretchy material around the opening of the shoe."
2.0,"Before ordering I checked around to see if Vans generally ran small, or large, or just right. The consensus seemed to be that Vans are usually right where they should be on the size scale, but mine most certainly were not. And not even ""slightly small"" so I could get by wearing them, maybe stretch them out a bit over time. These mash my toes. I'm not even sure a half-size up would fit either. And yet other reviews on here say the shoe ran too big for the size they're used to. I don't know, maybe this seller gets the reject Vans?"
5.0,"Van's was my first job when I was in high school, and slip on skate shoes were pretty much what I wore every day. These fit pretty much true to size, so if you wear a 9, get a 9. These shoes are SKATE shoes, so they are designed for ""feel"" of what's happening under your feet....important for a skater. If you are planning to walk long distances in these shoes, like ten miles, you might want to consider something else because these shoes don't have lots of cushioning, as they are designed. I don't get people who buy skate shoes then complain about this. Duh. These shoes look great with shorts or jeans, and since I'm too old to ride a skateboard anymore, I bought them primarily to make plane travel easier. No more messing with laces at the security checkpoint, I just slip these off walk through security and slip them back on. Easy peasy!"
5.0,"They were a tad width to small, but I'm sure they will loosen up as you wear them.
Black is such a goodcolor"
5.0,"this item was too small, but the person was able to take them back to a  store, so that was cool."
4.0,"Bought these a gift for a man.  He really liked the shoes!! They're great for casual wear to slightly dressy.  For men they run a little on the small side. We had to return and go up a size to get the right fit.  I would recommend going up 1/2 size if you're ordering these shoes.

I was pleased with the look and quality.  Despite the issue with the size we would order these again."
4.0,My brother and I inevitably would need shoes. So I bought them to appease my mom and I like them.
5.0,These shoes came quick. I'm a female that wears a size 8 shoes so ordering a 6.5 in men's the fit was Perfect. Use them for work
5.0,"Great throw on shoe for anything. They fit the way I expected because I've had them before in a different color, but these go great with jeans or just to wear around the house."
4.0,"I ordered my normal size and these fit just a tad snuggly.  That may change as they wear in.  I'm hoping so.  but even at being just a tad too snug, they are very comfortable.  And talk about non-skid!  You're not going anywhere except where you intend to wearing these shoes.  Next question is how long will they last?  We'll see!?"
2.0,"The shoes looked nice but the color was more pinkish red than they looked online; quality was as expected. They also did not fit well--the top of the shoe was too tight. I had to return them. On that note, the company was very accommodating and speedy at accepting the product back and refunding the money."
5.0,"I got these for my husband who, even in his thirties never ties his shoes. He normally wears skate shoes for their support. I wouldnt recommend if you are walking alot but for an everyday kick around shoe, they are perfect. They fit as eexpected."
2.0,"Cute.  Good price.  Just wasn't love at first sight.

Fit was a problem because it was a men's size and I had to guess-timate.  Sent these back too."
5.0,My hubby really loved his Vans. He loved the style and fit. Will he purchasing more in the future for our family.
5.0,Was delivered quickly and in beautiful shape. Love vans and will last me a long time! Would recommend to anyone that likes vans since the price is cheaper than the store.
1.0,"I have been wearing the same type of sneakers for the past six years (3 different pairs, as I only where them to the pool on Saturdays/Sundays).  I always ordered them directly from Vans, although my son (who is an avid fan of Amazon; Scotsil@gmail.com, one of your most loyal and best customers, as he is a shopaholic) told me to order the sneakers from your site and, in fact, they were approximately $10 less expensive.  As soon as I got them, I checked the size (which was the same as I had ordered for my last three pairs) and then threw out the box, assuming (unfortunately) that they would fit.  After wearing them a number of times, I knew that they were way too big and were causing me back pain.  I therefore went to a local shoe repair shop and purchased pads (two per shoe, as the gap was so wide) to go on the back interior.  However, they are not working, although I do not believe they are a knockoff/imitation of a true Van's sneaker.  Please note that I rarely complain about these issues, especially when the amount in controvery is only $35.  However, it is extremely annoying as I threw out my old vans and now cannot wear the new ones which will require me to go to the store in the mall during this very busy Holiday Season.  I understand if there is nothing you can do to accomodate me but, if there is, it will transform me into the same customer my son is.  Thank you for your consideration.  Joseph Silver."
4.0,I ordered these as a gift because I draw on them and then apply a rain sealant. The recipient seemed pleased with the shoes and she wears them often. I perosnally know Vans to be a great shoe company. They run true to size and have lasted me for years.
5.0,"I prefer vans then nike's Or Adidas they Are confortable, Good Looking, Great Style, Classic Of Couse And fit With Any type of clothes"
2.0,The shoes arrived as scheduled but in a very battered box and with one size 6 shoe and one size 7.5 shoe.  Amazon will refund my money when I package them back up for return.  Have to buy ink for the printer to print out the return form and make arrangements with FedEx to stop and pick them up.  Not a happy customer.  I didn't give it one star because the customer service after the fact was pretty good.  It'd be better if they could take away the inconvenience of packaging up for return and not having the shoes when we needed them.
1.0,"Soles separetet at the  edge on first trip out not satisfied at all have paid much less and had better service ,will not but brand again."
4.0,"28"" case is fashionable and big enough to pack a weeks worth of clothes and toiletries in. Four wheels to make it easy for you to haul around without breaking a swet. Went to LA and Costa Rica within a two week stretch and was able to locate my bag without a problem. It's Swiss Army,  so it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!"
4.0,Vans run a little larger so the shoe was bigger then expected. Other then that the product was received in a timely manner and in good shape.
5.0,I bought these as a replacement for my daughter's old Vans.  She loves these shoes.  They hold up well and she has no complaints about them.
4.0,"Be careful when ordering things online, since you can't try them on. Most places want you to pay the return shipping, and that sucks. Fortunately we know people who have a shoe stretcher, since mine came a little small. Too tight to wear. U sed a shoe stretcher a few times, and voila!

Would be a 5 rating, but they were too small. 11 is a half size bigger than my foot, and usually fits a tiny bit loose, so this was a surprise. I have been getting size 11 for 19 years."
5.0,"These shoes are just what I was looking for. The only thing that I was disappointed with is the color. I expected it to be a lighter grey, but it's pretty dark."
5.0,"Ordered these Van Skate shoes for my 10-yr-old grandson; they arrived just a couple of days ago. This is his third pair of Vans and I love that they have proved sturdy and always true to size.  The price was great (less than what I saw in retail stores), and they really look good.  He loves them because they are 'awesome!'"
5.0,"A nice new pair of checkered Vans, how can you go wrong? Super cool, can't wait to give these as a gift for Christmas. They arrived quickly, came with the original box and tags, all is well."
5.0,"excellent slip on shoes for my son  don't have to worry about shoe laces, or washing them because of color"
3.0,"I've always worn Vans, I bought Vans for my son as a toddler. Very nice shoe at a good price but they seem to run narrow. Had to return. We ended up with Airwalks from Payless."
5.0,"but once you wear them for a few hours, they completely mold to your foot and now I love them."
4.0,"I received these quickly and they fit well. They have enough space in them to fit thick socks, which is good since winter is approaching in NYC. I recommend that people follow the size guide if they're women wanting to get it in a men's size. For example I wear an 8 in women shoes, but I wanted to get a men's size so I got a 6.5,"
4.0,"Vans are great shoes - we buy them a lot for my autistic son since he can't do ties, and velcro is hard to find in adult mens shoes (big foot kid!) - so slip on vans it is!
We typically buy blue (the only color he'll wear) - but couldn't find blue in the right size so I got the white (it's cream colored actually) to dye blue. These shoes don't hold dye very well - so if you want an off white - or cream slip on sneaker - then this is perfect. If you are looking to dye it, or need white - think again."
1.0,There not the right size and one of them were ripped there not good shoes there too bad this product has a big problem
3.0,"Vans are really good shoes, comfortable and stylish. They run really small and narrow, which is a problem when you ra ordering shoes online. These shoes were at least 1/2 size smaller than the size indicated, and very narrow. Bear that in mind when buying."
5.0,Previous pairs fit and wore well.  All of the purchases below were gifts for grandchildren as suggested by their parents and I assume they enjoyed them.
5.0,"I wear these all the time, love slip-ons, but there is no support so I have to buy inserts for them."
5.0,You can't go wrong with classic vans.  They are true to size and super comfortable.  I also enjoy the high tops.
4.0,"A good looking & fitting shoe
A good color and design
Very comfortable,especially in warm weather
Have recommended to others"
2.0,"Ive had these shoes for two months and they are already falling apart.  literally the seams are coming undone and the bottom of the shoe is just hanging on for dear life.  Very disappointing,"
5.0,The Vans are really good skate shoes they fit my feet semi tight semi lose but they are good for boarding
5.0,"As above, it's what was ordered. Came promptly and it will take  a few years to wear this pair out"
5.0,"Plain black, casual, and comfortable. What more can I ask for? Plus, it's REALLY cheap. I originally bought this for casual purposes but now I wear them all the time"
5.0,And these were just the PERFECT price !!! I really wanted some white vans that i could custom paint and they were perfect. Thanks! :)
4.0,"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend and he loved them. They were stylish and comfortable, and he said that they fit true to size. Vans are great."
4.0,"These shoes are very comfortable and look really cool. Unfortunately, they get dirty really quickly (since it's fabric not rubber), are hard to keep clean, and are starting to fall apart after around 3 months."
5.0,Love them! Comfy and easy to slip on! Perfect for our sailboat! Love the colt and style! Matching shoes with hubby!
5.0,"Well, I guess i had another pair in a 4 in the kids, not mens, as these new ones fit really differently. my kids size 4 is a little too big on me and these are a bit too small. i wear them for work, plain and do the trick i just wish i ordered a little larger."
5.0,looking for basic black shoe that provide some comfort. This shoe delivered so far and I would love it in another color
3.0,"For some reason I love Vans but until they are broken in good, they will make your life miserable. The padding around the ankle is smaller than the rest of the shoe so it digs in your heels something awful."
2.0,"It didn't say men's and I'm a female I wanna give it back because its the wrong size, not me"
5.0,its exactly as if you would buy it from the vans store but its a lot less expensive. Mine have held up pretty well and ive worn them a lot.
5.0,"is is so unique, shoe."
5.0,this purchase fits well to size.  tight to slide foot in at first but I am sure will loosen up.
5.0,I wear them at work and they are great! super comfortable and don't really stink up like most shoes after hours of working on my feet!
5.0,"Its my annual gift to my gal, she loves these things.  I get her a new pair every year and they are always the same great quality."
3.0,"I bought this hoping to have a nice pair of boat shoes to wear but unfortunately these shoes fit narrower than my other Vans Classic Skate Slip-ons Unisex shoes.

This is a good product, just not for a wide footed person."
5.0,"Love the comfort of these along with the design!!  I liked them so much, I bought a second pair for when the first ones wear out."
2.0,"There is no arch support at all, and they feel like ones you buy at Walmart for $9.99. Very thin sole"
5.0,"Well they are holding up well, their easy to slip on and the variety of colors helps make for a nice sneaker.
Their comfy, stylish and easy to slip on and off. I'm glad I bought these and I recommend them for everyone."
4.0,I love my Vans.  Haven't had a pair like this in 15 years but nice to see they haven't changed and are as comfortable and functional as ever.  :)
5.0,This is my third pair of these shoes. Each pair last me about two years. I just wish that they had more arch support because I am on my feet alot. I live wearing these shoes with pants shorts and skirt. It is a perfect casual shoe.
3.0,"These look great i love them but i don't understand why everyone is saying they run too small when they actually run too big, at least for me they do. Other than that they look really nice i love them."
5.0,"Great shoes, fit fantastic, super easy to wear (slip right on), and they have become my everyday shoes. I love 'em"
5.0,"When we were kids, we called these ""Boat Shoes"".. We always wore them.  Usually the navy with ties.  My husband wanted a pair that slipped on so I suprised him with these.  He loves them.  Were in our 50's now and these are still great shoes."
5.0,Great pair to go with anything. I'd advise to go half size to a whole size up. They run a little small.
4.0,"The color is right, the size is right. They seems to have good quality. I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"I love the shoes, perfect fit, perfect color, just perfect. I've worn them since I got them and they got scuffed up a bit but nothing a little soap and bleach cant fix."
5.0,"This is a great casual shoe in the Vans tradition.  It's good for warm weather; it's lightweight, comfortable, and casual.  Watch out that you order a bigger size -- I'm normally a 10.5 or 11; I was comfortable in a 12."
5.0,Everyone should have a pair of these. I don't know how I lived without them for a year. May need to get a couple other colors.
4.0,The shoes were great fit right and were clean. One problem was the back of the shoe rubs on my heel and hurts
5.0,"best shoes for stealth in dealing with sneaking away from ex's after stalking or quietly out running the neighbor's pit bull.
always good on a boat for stowing away on a disney adventure cruise and stylish with surf shorts or a tuxedo.
I wear nothing else on casual friday."
5.0,"I am a huge fan of Vans, and almost always have a pair in my closet. This helps when buying online, since you already know what size to go for. I usually wear a 7.5, and as always they fit perfectly. The color was also as expected and it arrived in a timely manner."
5.0,"fit is snug  just as expected.  vans slip on shoes are very light, almost like being barefoot.  my legs and back feel great wearing these shoes on my days off."
5.0,"these are no immatation, they are the real deal. they are well made and come clean with no dirt or marks on them whatsoever."
5.0,Great pair of shoes. This is my third pair of Vans slip on shoes. I use two older pairs for the gym. This new one is great for short walks around the block.
2.0,"I typically wear a size 8-9 (W) depending on the style/brand. I have several pairs of Converse (low-tops) and I get a size 7.5 (M) that fit perfectly. I figured that these would be relatively similar because they are kind of the same style - I was actually worried that they might be a little snug. Boy was I wrong, THESE ARE HUGE.

I wish I could wear them, but my feet just slide around inside. I can't return them because I don't live in the US and paying to return would cost an insane amount. I will probably give them to my brother."
5.0,"My husband has always loved deck shoes but lately they have become a little hard to find, this was a treasure trove of styles and colors and sizes! His size 13 also hard to find in stylish shoes."
5.0,"i had this shoes but in different color, since the old one did great i ordered this in my favorite color!
i strongly recommend it to friends and anyone who's looking for comfort and cool look :)
i got it on time!"
5.0,"Shared with my 15yo daughter that this was the shoe when I was in school growing up by the beach.  Bought this for her, she loves it and the style!"
4.0,"I love these shoes.  The size fit just as expected and I wear these into the ground until I purchase the next pair.  The black color even lets me get away with comfortable (casual) office attire and even goes well enough with some of my (dressier) pants.  The one problem I seem to keep having is holes in the sole, near the ball of my foot.  This isn't pleasant even when it's just a tad wet outside.  I will keep buying these as long as they keep making them."
3.0,Make sure you get a size bigger cuz these shoes are super tight on wide feet and impossible to stretch
4.0,"With most canvas shoes I find the sole starts to tear away from the canvas, near the ball of the foot especially. While this did happen with these shoes, over time, I find they did last considerably longer than the others I have purchased. All in all a very comfortable shoe. These were my 'best-man' shoes for my buddy's wedding."
5.0,Purchased for the husband. He doesn't like sandals. These are the perfect hang around the house or by the pool shoe.
5.0,"Seriously... why tie shoes when you can basically wear slippers all day, every day. They are quality shoes for the price."
4.0,I bought these for my daughter to  replace another of the same which she wore for a year.  These arrived quickly and were just as expected.  Her new favorite pair of shoes.
4.0,"My son loves these, they are well constructed and more than I expected from a slip on shoe.  Would buy again."
5.0,Vans is a good classic loafer shoe for easy on and off.  It is very comfortable and well made so will wear for a bit.
5.0,"Best ""anything"" shoes. Wear them everyday, they've gone through any climate condition, dust, water, snow, and sand. I love them."
2.0,"I ordered these in men's 6.5/women's 8, which is my true size.  It was a struggle to get my feet all the way into the shoes because the upper is so tight.  If I order a half size up though, my heels will slip out of the back.  So, while the length of the shoe is true, the space between the insole and upper only allows for a pancake thin foot!  If these are the only shoes someone wears, it's probably because their grossly misshapen feet won't fit into normal shoes!

That being said, I did receive my shipment quickly.  The sizing on this page was very misleading, but I looked at shoezoo's website to make sure the size I ordered would be the size I received (they were the vendor that came up when I chose my size from the drop down).  I only wish they offered free returns."
4.0,"Its Vans- good shoe. Shipping was fast and packaging was sufficient. Would definitely buy from again this seller.

No problems!"
5.0,"These vans are exactly as described, they are a new product and not a knock off.  They fit great and look good too."
4.0,I gave these as a gift twice. One to a 2 years old and then again to my 3o year old husband. Both guys love them.
5.0,"GOOD MORNING) ON THE SECOND DAY OF CHRISTMAS MY TRUE LOVE GAVE TO ME..ALOHA HAPPY NEW YEAR+LOVE,CHERI XO!+:) THEGANESS VEGANESS+{ARRC}"
2.0,"Although these shoes are comfortable and easy to put on and take off, they destroy the integrity of almost any outfit I put on.  Anyone with fashion sense will advise against wearing these out.  They are more like house slippers.  You're more likely to get laid wearing Crocs."
5.0,"I loved these as a kid and decided to give them a shot as an adult and they are just as cool as when I was a kid. Great fit to. We will see if the build quality holds up like they did when I was a kid. My guess is no, but we will see."
4.0,The shoes were a Christmas gift.  The box was in bad shape but the shoes were clean and appeared to be new.
5.0,These are great shoes. They are both casual and comfortable. I've had several pairs of these and have always been happy with them.
5.0,"vans never disapoint me..this time I got the correct size and they were all that I expect them to be..
comfortable, and they go great with anything I wear.."
5.0,"all came at the appointed time and undamaged recommend
everything was as I saw on page are respopnsable and fast deliveries"
5.0,"Very comfortable (either with or without socks), well built shoe for the money. I'll buy Vans shoes again in a different color or style."
5.0,i bought these for my niece for a bday gift and she loved them she said they lasted longer the the ones she got in stores and they were cheaper
5.0,"He loves them. I've had to wash them and they held up. He wears them outside, on his bike, in the rain, everything. They have served thier purpose well."
3.0,"quality looks good! comfortable, but not reach my expection. now is hard to find the white color of this shoes."
5.0,"This product meets all expectations that I needed.
I like the state as arrival at their destination. Brand new.
I highly recommend this product for its excellent quality."
3.0,"These are NOT the original VANS....says my husband who has worn VANS for years. And the sizing is completely wrong. I thought I'd surprise him with a pair so looked on his old ones, got the size, ordered new ones and they were completely HUGE! Had to return them. I'll stick to buying them on Eastbay and Zappos....sorry Amazaon!"
4.0,"i was very pleased with the quick delivery, got them within a few days... i've been getting black/black Vans classic slip-on's for yrs now and love them, unfortunately, my only quip is that the top back part digs into the back of my heal & tears them up when breaking them in, I recommend applying moleskin... i wonder why the manufacturer can't correct this problem and design better protection... also the canvas uppers wear out pretty fast... wish Vans would put out a black/black ""SUEDE"" slip on... would seem like an obvious more durable choice... not to mention the sleek suede appearance... just my two cents..."
1.0,"Read the description and other people's reviews and was convince they'd replace my daily slip-ons, also including for easy airport travel, and am unhappy with them. The material is not suede-like but is closer to canvass.  They are tight and in no way supportive and just not worth fifty bucks plus nione dollars shipping.  Wife threw out box so not returnable.  Would never buy from this vendor again and am now very skeptical about Vans products."
5.0,"The product is great, fits well. I get compliments on it at work. I like that it is a neutral color, but has a bit more interest with the checkerboard pattern. Don't worry, ""pewter"" does not mean that it is reflective."
5.0,"Cool, stylish, comfortable classic shoes. Fits the look for casual wear or slightly dressed up, can almost double as a sneaker and a dressier shoes. very comfortable for work as well."
3.0,"I love the look of these shoes, and they are comfortable, but I'm disappointed in their build quality. I have had them a few months and already the upper checkered material has come apart and separated from the sole of the left shoe. This doesn't prevent me from wearing them, and I still do, but it is disappointing since the rest of the shoe is in like-new condition. It seems almost like a defect specific to just this design since I also have an all black model slip-on just like these which I've had longer and this did not happen."
2.0,The shoe may have been good quality but I was never able to try it because even though it says size 10 it is actually closer to a size 7.  Now I don't know if it is a mistake that it was mislabeled at the factory or if Martians made these shoes according to their smaller Martian feet... I may never know.
4.0,This shoe was good quality and shipped fast I really liked them they are really nice and comfy and good looking
5.0,"I mainly got this shoe because I'm fairly lazy. They were to replace a similar shoe with laces. I tied them in such a way that I could just slip them on and off, however the laces could still come untied every now and again. When they came in, I slipped them on and I was surprised at how comfortable they were. You're mostly paying for the insoles in my opinion. The outers sole is very similar to many of Vans' shoe models and this tends to wear on the toe and heel quite rapidly even when the shoes are only worn when walking. Other than that, they are great. Snug fit, and comfy. Also you can pretty much get them in any color you want."
4.0,"The shoes look great but they are just black with shiny black squares, not charcoal and black  like in the picture. Also if you're  half size shoe person , like me, order the half size up.  Typically I am a size 7.5, so that's what I ordered. The shoes were nearly impossible to put on. It was a very tight squeeze and my toes were a little cramped.  I am going to try to exchange it for a size eight.  I suggest actually going to a store if you can. I wish I could have.

TL;DR  round up your shoe size when ordering (7.5 -> 8)"
5.0,"I purchased these shoes for my Son for Christmas. After a mix-up over the size, my Son got his shoes he January which he loves and they fit him perfectly."
5.0,"This shoe fits extremely tight, I'm probably going to send back and order a larger size, I can't decide if I'm going a whole size up or 1/2 size up... Love this shoe though!"
4.0,"I purchased these shoes with high hopes merely because they were to be my next pair for the next year or so. I love this type of shoe Vans produces. They are easy to put on, take off, and there's no need to hassle with shoe strings. But when I received my pair a week later, they were size 7. I wear size 11 and a half. This was a problem. To be perfectly clear, after I had purchased the item (and realizing there was no shoe size drop down box online) I emailed the shoe company. I let them know that I wasn't sure if the random 7 in the title meant the actual shoe size or some other code I wasn't aware of. This number did not make it's size obvious, like other shoe purchases. After waiting, the company never emailed me back. So, I sent another, saying yet again that I am a size 11 just in case and that I would really appreciate it if they could confirm the shoe size for me. Unfortunately, no response. So, I gave them a call explaining my situation and their representative was glad to help and researched the shoe size for me and told me they had one last pair in stock in my size. With hopes that the last pair wasn't in their display case, he said he would gladly email a shipping label so I could return the shoes asap. I waited, checked my email, waited some more, checked again (over a weeks span, of course), but nothing happened. At last, I just gave up and gave the undersized shoes to my aunt to give to my cousin for Christmas. I would've tried and tried again (some more) to get my size shoes, but there was a two-week return policy, and by the time I had waited for their shipping label, or phone call, or email, two weeks was past overdue. Moral of the story: Don't order shoes unless you know the exact size! I hope I saved someone some trouble."
5.0,"They are true to size and easy to slip on and off, I  will be buying some more in the future. We are overseas due to me in the militray and it only took about 15 days to get to me!"
5.0,The fit is good and the shoes and this site had the best price for these slip on Vans. The shipping was quick and cheap. Thanks for selling them
4.0,"Shirt received promptly and as shown and described. It is being worn fo a pirate-themed event for 1,100 employees.  One of our lead participants will be wearing this shirt along with her other pirate attire."
5.0,Needed this for a Captain Jack Sparrow costume for my grandson. This was a great find. Works perfectly for the costume.
2.0,Great style just 2 sizes too small. I had to cut the sides but made it work.  I am 6 ft 240 lbs.  One size didn't work for me.
3.0,Incredibly itchy
2.0,"Shirt material was very flimsy and it was too small for the size as a standard Large.  Even for a costume, we expected it to be more substantial."
3.0,Very thin and cheaply made but serves it's purpose.
2.0,Quality is lacking
5.0,Thin material but not bad quality. It was perfect for our warlock photo shoot! I plan on using it again in a viking shoot.
3.0,chest and waist good but sleeves are short
5.0,Worked well with my costume. Some assembly required.
5.0,AWESOME!!!!!!
5.0,Great for Ren faire!
5.0,"Fit great! I'm 5'5 athletic build, and my boyfriend is 6'1, and very lean. We could both make the shirt work"
2.0,"One size fits most but not all. I went in really liking this shirt, even if it is pretty thin and cheap. It gets the job done for 1 night. BUT, Sleeves too short and i felt like the Hulk trying not to rip the back/sleeve seams. Oh well, im gonna go salvage and stitch pieces of it to make my own out of a henly."
4.0,"Husband used it for a costume. He is 6'1 athletic build, normally wears a 15 1/2 34/35. The shirt is made from thin material, if he wore it in the sun, you could see through it.  He wore it at night at a house party, no problems with coverage. Fit fine on him, sleeves seemed a bit short, but not noticeable.  String shown on cover was black, but white was shipped.  We just use a black leather shoe string."
2.0,I have a 44 chest and wear a 33/34 shirt.  The sleeves on this large came about half way down my forearms.
2.0,very hot  not a cool shirt
3.0,Runs small.  Be warned.
1.0,All Privious drivers found address
4.0,"Nice shirt. Sleeves were w little short.
Length was good.
Material seems delicate not sure how it will hold up.
Wearing it this week end so I guess I will find out.
Overall a nice looking pirate shirt."
1.0,Never wash!  Cheapo material shreds in water and shrinks to about 1/4 original size.
2.0,"Very small for ""men's"" one size fits all."
4.0,It's a bit thin and it is rather wrinkled. Wasn't expecting high quality for the price. Looked great and worked for our murder mystery dinner.
5.0,Halloween Costume quality but perfect for a fast Ren Faire outfit. Was able to wash in the washing machine but lacing on front had to be removed beforehand because the color bled.
5.0,"Awesome quality,  great fun to wear"
5.0,Got it for my brother and he looks so handsome!
3.0,The description said 1 size fits most.....I guess my husband isn't most.
1.0,The shirt is a piece of junk.  I just threw it in the trash.
5.0,"Great, basic pirate shirt. Used it for our Princess Bride/Wesley costume and it was perfect!"
4.0,"my tall, thin, 19 year old son wore it....It was large but fine for a costume shirt!"
2.0,Bought for my costume.. Ended up letting my 3 year old wear it. It's for a child
5.0,Works well for the price.
5.0,Worked great as a Halloween costume!
5.0,Worked out well for my husband this year for Halloween!
5.0,Bought for boyfriends costume and left it in tea to stain. Came out perfect and super cheap!
5.0,Purchased this shirt for my husband to wear as the Dread Pirate Roberts (from the Princess Bride). He wears between a L-XL and this fit him perfectly. If you are looking for a pirate shirt this fits the bill.
4.0,a little thin but otherwise perfect costume shirt
4.0,"This was used as part of my son's pirate costume.  He is 6 foot 2 inches, about 180 pounds, and it looked just right on him.  It hung a little loose, which was what he wanted.  The brown lacing down the front was a nice touch. It feels a little like gauze and is a very thin fabric, so he wore an undershirt with it so it wouldn't be see-through.  He said it was very comfortable, and he did not tuck it in.  The funny thing was that another party goer was wearing the same shirt, and this other guy was a pretty hefty fellow, but the shirt looked great on him too!  It truly is a one-size fits most shirt."
1.0,"I haven't put the shirt on yet.  It smells of mothballs or something similar.  I mean, it reeks.  I washed it in Woolite hoping it will help, but I still smell it even while it is wet.  I'm not that sensitive to smell, but I'm not sure I can tolerate this shirt for one night."
5.0,Actually fit better then I expected when i pulled it out of the packaging.
2.0,Great style but horrible fabric - polyester nylon.  Not a hint of cotton in it as stated in the description.
2.0,"A little flimsy. But, for occasional usage, I hope it holds up!"
5.0,Perfect!
4.0,"Reasonably well made, has held up to a couple of washings without problems."
4.0,Great service. Item was nice.
4.0,"For the price and its purpose (namely, ONE NIGHT'S WEAR at a ritzy Halloween party) this flimsy bit of pseudo-fabric did the job, fit perfectly, looked sharp, and held together. The lace-up front got a lot of compliments for ""sexiness,"" so if you're rocking the sexy buccaneer ""look"" for a cos-party, this might be a useful accessory. Just keep in mind that, if you wear it for a few hours and do some serious dancing/partying in a big crowd, you're not going to want to try to wear it again, or even salvage it. I just ripped it off my hot body and threw it into the trash before I jumped into the shower at night's end. But it had been a GOOD night, I can tell you that much."
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot. It was kind of big, but, for a pirate, it works out fine. It was quite long though and looked like a dress on me, but tucked in just fine. Worked well for my costume and very light material, not itchy or uncomfortable"
5.0,"Fit my husband, who is an XL in the shoulders, perfectly. Also works great as a woman's pirate dress! Just add a belt :)"
4.0,"The material is slightly more transparent than it seems in the picture, but the shirt is altogether a very nice addition to any pirate / buccanneer costume.  leather laced front, elastic for the cuffs and a ""poofy"" ruffled lapel.  Fits me perfectly (5'7"", 175)"
5.0,"This was  a great buy. Used it for renaissance festival. Yes it's thin, a lot of shirts like this  are. But is perfect for renaissance. I think it's something you would see sold at renaissance festival for $45 or $50."
4.0,I like the style of the shirt. And size is ok too.the shirt will be goog with a shirt underneath because it is a little thin
5.0,"I just came back from taking an hour walk in these shoes for the first time and they felt wonderful for my trouble feet. I have flat feet and a bit of arthritis in one foot. These shoes performed very well. I have thin heels so a tiny bit slippage but nothing too bad. I usually put orthodics in shoes but didn't need to with these. Lots of cushioning and overall support, great ankle support. They are not the most attractive shoe but they are decent. Kind of clunky in the back but don't mind being that they help my feet not to hurt. I would definitely recommend these shoes. They are very lightweight too, a good amount of room in toes and no breaking in needed!"
5.0,"I have bought these 3 times now  and have tried others in between. Best shoes I have ever owned!  The toe bed is wide that's great if you have bunions.  The size is perfect, and there is plenty of room for my orthotics without removing the inserts. Before my feet hurt so bad by the end of an 8 hour standing shift I could barely make it to the car. With them I could go another 2-3 hours if I have to (knock on wood that I never do)  I hope they never stop making these paticular shoes."
5.0,"I think I have bought 10 pair of these shoes over the last 7 years. They wear great (I am very hard on shoes) and they fit the same each time. I use different inserts because of my feet issues, but the inserts work great and the shoe holds it fit very well."
3.0,"I have mixed-last feet that are very wide in the front only. According to the company's Web site, the extra wide is a WW - WWW, so I decided to try both a wide, supposedly D/E, and extra wide.

For the extra wide to fit correctly with my orthodics, I needed to take out BOTH insoles and change the lacing to bypass the lowest hole. Taking out the ""mosaic"" inner sole is a pain - the little pieces along the edges come off as you try to get a grasp on it - you'd think they'd design something you could grab onto, at least initially. I don't think it would survive being taken in and out multiple times for adjustment.

I can feel cushioning from the mosaic innersole - but it makes the shoe too tight - and I'm not sure how much good the mosaic would do if you could get it right. Maybe this would work if you're at a specialist who has a machine that can translate how you walk onto the mosaic and if you don't need the extra width.

I am probably going to keep them because they have a fairly straight last, don't seem to have an excessive rollbar correction - and because I'm desperate for a pair of shoes I can wear. I don't think they're worth the price premium."
3.0,"Clunky fit well made shoe, if you need ahigh arch don't bother. Had to return."
5.0,It's very good shoes and comfortable. It's just a little bit big but not a big deal. It's very light on the weight .
5.0,"I have worn Aetrex footwear for years.  The support is amazing,
the fit is as stated with room in the front of the foot so that your toes don't hurt.
The back of the shoe isn't too tall and does NOT hurt at all.
IF your looking for a superior fit, support, all day standing comfort  then You don't have
to look any further. This isn't a flat insole, I have a high arch and this shoe gives support.
Aetrex has been around a good while, and craftsmanship is superior!"
5.0,"6-30-15. I've been using AETREX  Walkers shoes for about five years and they are great. My wife has bad feet and most shoes do not work for her but the APEX (AETREX brand) work well. She wanted a black pair similar to the white ones she has and these do the job. I've use men's Walkers daily for work and NEVER had a foot problem, even walking 4 miles or more and on my feet a lot.  Great stuff"
4.0,These shoes are just right for me.
5.0,Excellent product. I have flat feet and can't walk without these shoes!
5.0,Perfect fit great price and shipped quickly.
5.0,Just what I expected.  A great shoe to wear with my custom orthotics.  Will buy them again.
1.0,"Heel too wide. I am going to give them away.  I love the Apex walking shoe, but this is a very different fit.  I called Apex and they didn't know about this Aetrex model even though it has the same model number as the Apex.  Don't buy the Aetrex.  It is not as well made as the Apex and it has ugly white stripes on the heel.

I feel ripped off."
3.0,I have worn these shoes for many years and they work well for me and my orthotics but the length of time it took to be receive the order from FootSmart was frustrating.  There was no tracking for the shipment and when I called Foot Smart directly I received different information.  Foot Smart caused this to be a 3 star instead of a 5 star experience.
5.0,"I stand on my feet all day at work.  I can't have anything that feels hard, I like soft cushiony soles.  These are that.  I have worn them for 8 months now and they are getting worn out, but 5 days of week times 7.5 hours of standing is a lot of time on them.  They have done a great job at helping me hold up throughout the day."
5.0,"I wear these with custom orthotics and they are super comfortable, reasonably durable, and I can walk all day in them and they don't make my feet feel horrible. I have chronic plantar fasciitis, and I can even run for short distances in these without causing a major flare-up."
5.0,"I wish I could get an assortment of shoes using this shoe's sole. Every journey could be a pleasure. These offer supreme comfort, shock absorption and support. At the end of the day, my feet are just as happy as the beginning of the day. I bought a pair in black to wear to work occasionally and wore them an entire week. Wow! It was great. Unfortunately, they're just not dressy enough to wear so often at work. However, I wear them every chance I get."
5.0,I'm a waitress and on my feet all day I love these shoes. My feet don't hurt at the end of the day.
5.0,"My feet don't hurt!  This is stunning to me. I have a large bunion on my left foot and these shoes accommodate that beautifully. These shoes do exactly what they say...plenty of toe room, lots of support, cradling the foot in the proper position.  I will buy these again and use this company from now on."
3.0,Shoes are a little too big in the heel area causing slippage when walking. Otherwise it would have been ok. I sent them back and will look for something else.
3.0,"My job requires me to stand on my feet 8 hours a day, so I was looking for a shoe that could provide me all day support and cushioning.  Cutting right to the chase, it is not a combination last, meaning the heal is way too big for me.  I notice my heals slide around in the shoe.  For the money I spent on these shoes, and based on others' reviews, I am disappointed.  I wouldn't purchase these shoes again."
5.0,"My toes need room, but my heels aren't wide so ""wide"" sizes don't work for me.  These shoes in ""medium"" let my toes move without being floppy loose.  I've got that blasted plantar fascia....whatever problem and I need arch support as well as cushioning.  These shoes are very comfortable."
2.0,"This shoe may have potential but there were two major problems with this order and one minor issue.  The shoe is a full INCH longer than all my other size 9 athletic walker shoes! The width is good I suppose but the crazy length renders the shoe unfit.

 Even though the sizing of the shoe is NOT my fault, the seller does NOT pay return postage so to get my money back I have to pay to return these.  I will not reorder from this seller.

This order also took a long time to show up."
5.0,I ordered these black  tennis shoes for my granddaughter who works in a General Dollar Store and is on her feet for hours at the time.  They are very comfortable.  They are just right for her work.  Shipping was fast too.
5.0,"on my 4 year old.
They are  soft and do not have the big ""pocket"" in the front that may others made"
1.0,Becauase the boxers were too small. It doesnt fit when i wear them. I don't know what more words i can use to decribe this
4.0,My son is 46 x 46 and just turned 7.  He is fairly skinny.  He definitely wears a 6/7 size.  These are a bit snug  and I could see that he won't be able to wear them as long as I'd hoped due to size.  Good quality and nice bright colours.  Wish they were a bit roomier.
5.0,"I brought it for my son - he is almost 6 years old.
The size fits perfect for him.
Also the colors are the same as displayed at the picture.
It was packed well."
5.0,"Excellent product and liked it so much as it is seen at the site
Thank you very much and Best regards"
1.0,"The product arrived. We can say at least that the seller is responsible, but the size is very small, I assume that I could be the one who mistook Small 6/7 I did not see. I'll be more careful before."
5.0,"My son got 2 pair of these as a birthday gift a few months ago. He loved them! They were the only underware that he wanted to wear.

I bought several more pair and you would have thought he was in heaven."
5.0,Great fit and quality.very  Comfortable and durable. My son loves wearing them .We will probably purchase them again in another color.
2.0,not worth returning
5.0,These are so soft and are sized well.
4.0,"I have a barely 3 year old and am thankful we got the size we did. They are my favorite, though! So GQ and cute!!! Look great with his True Religions :)! #spoiled"
5.0,Great product!
5.0,gear for my 5y boy
1.0,The gray pair got a whole after about six months of less than once a week where. I don't know if it was a fabric defect but I will go back to get ole Haynes
5.0,"my son loves them , they are very good quality"
5.0,At first my grandson didn't like these boxers. He finally tried them and has been wearing them ever since.
5.0,These were so cute and comfy. Too bad my tall boy is growing..
3.0,"These boxer briefs are adorable! My son is taller for his age, and these fit right in his butt and thighs but a little big in the waist. Most kids go through growth spurts, so maybe they will fit just right soon."
1.0,Items are smaller for 3 sizes than expected.
5.0,"Very good quality and comfortable underwear for my son, highly recommend!"
5.0,Good
5.0,Fit great and soft material.

5.0,love the underwear for my son
4.0,My son loves these and says they are very comfortable but we ordered up a size.  He wears an 11 in pants and we ordered the size 12-14.  And they are quite snug!  Otherwise I would have given them 5-stars.
3.0,Seemed on the tight side compared to hanes or fruit of the loom.
5.0,My nephew loves these jeans. I asked him to try them on and he was all smiles. Perfect for picky boys!
5.0,My son loves this brand and these underwear!

5.0,My son love it.
5.0,My son loves his Calvin Kleins!! Of course!!
4.0,Good
5.0,"Good quality product, and washed up very well."
5.0,I love these for my 7 yr old son. They run small. My son is tall & thin and currently wears a size 6 or small in bottoms. In these he wears the 8/10 size.
5.0,Comfortable
5.0,Excellent
5.0,Very soft and great fit.
5.0,love my calvins
4.0,These run at least 2 to 3 sizes too small !  I read reviews so I knew this and for my 11-year-old I bought the extra-large sizes 16 to 18 and although he normally wears a size 12 these fit him snugly. If you want loosefitting boxers these are not the ones for you .  Also the ones we ordered do not have a fly hole in the front .  otherwise these are great boxers. I've ordered these in the past and I will continue to order for him as long as I know that they will fit him. There are some negative reviews about the sizes however if you spend a few minutes reading the reviews you'll realize fairly quickly that you need to size up and then they're fine .
4.0,Runs a bit small. The colors are great. The material is soft. Just a bit small
5.0,Nice..
3.0,"perfect fit, but colors faded after 1 washing"

5.0,good~!!!
5.0,Good product!!!
5.0,Perfect! Been purchasing these for years and the quality of material is getting better!
5.0,"These are super!  My son was ready for a different style and these were a real winner.  We ordered a 2 pack in the beginning, and several more a week later when we knew they were a sure thing.  They are very light weight, stretchy, and a performance fabric that keeps cool and doesn't stick to clothing.  He gives it 5 stars."
5.0,Great product
5.0,"Fit amazing, they are super soft, and feel amazing. They also make your bulge look big to be honest. Girls love them."
5.0,The large fits my 11 year old son. He weighs 92 pounds. They fit perfect.
5.0,13 yr old Grandson loves the fit.
5.0,"Very nice, fit just right and my grandson loves them!"
5.0,I bought size - L for my 8 yo son (hi is tall for his age but thin about 72 lb) a few months ago and we both are completely satisfied with this boxers. The fabric is thin but not much just perfect for warm and hot weather.
5.0,good~
5.0,Awesome and he says they're very comfortable
1.0,Not what i thought!
3.0,too small and tight.
1.0,Ordered an XL and received a L so too small.  Didn't realize until after the package was opened and overseas so no point in sending back.  Just upsetting that my order stated XL and got a L.
5.0,"When I washed I was afraid they had shrunk. As soon as he put them on I knew they had not. They fit snug with plenty of room in the male compartment. Not tight at all. Fabric moves very well and is the softest fabric of any underwear I have bought him. The 6yo said ""my butt didn't get hot today"", so I take that as a good thing. I will definitely buy more."
1.0,Size M is too small
4.0,"I purchased this in xl. I'm 125 lbs  waist 25"". These fit great.  being that they are kids sized they are mainly for petite women."
2.0,"Underwear is extremely small. All the other ""Calvin Klein "" underwear fit fine. Is this fake?? Way too small."
5.0,Very good quality and my boys loves them

5.0,"Since these are the ""boys"" sizes, I was concerned they might be small. But they fit great, and even have a little room should they shrink in the wash. (I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs, 29 inch waist, and ordered size 16-18). I can usually wear men's small as well, but these were cheaper, so I'm very happy."
4.0,kinda small
5.0,Nice
5.0,Great boxer briefs for my son.  He finds them comfortable.
5.0,These are great - my kid would not wear the traditional cotton briefs...these seem to be a bit more comfortable for him.
1.0,The sizes were much smaller than a typical 4/5 and 6
5.0,Great
5.0,Awesome as expected!
5.0,Perfect!!
5.0,My 13 year old likes these ones. I both the other style too that are shorter and these are better. I wasn't sure if I should go boys or mens. My kid is 5'4 and thin and these fit perfect.

I am 128 lbs. and 5'7"". I wear 28 waist pants."
5.0,Son loves them.  Nice quality and fit.
5.0,Bought size medium for my 9 year old son...fit perfect.

1.0,Not true to size
5.0,works
5.0,We've tried several different types and brands of underwear since potty training and these are by far my 4 year old's favorite pairs. While are a little bit pricier than the Hanes or store brands they are also the only ones that don't ride up around his leg.
5.0,"They do run a little tight, but these are the most comfortable boxer briefs I own. Super stretchy, thin fabric. Look great. LOVE THEM."
3.0,Very itchy
5.0,These are the cutest.  Got the size 4 for my slender 4 year-old (maybe 33ish pounds?) --they fit great.  Will buy again.
4.0,"I ordered M! They fit well for my almost 8yearold son. But i will re order it next sizeup for him.
N i like ck underwear more than other brands because of these are better fabrics n well made.
Thanks Amazon!"
5.0,"Great fit.  My son really like them and his dad is jealous about them even if he denies it.  After several washes, they Look brand new"
3.0,"The colors are vibrant, as pictured, and I like the fabric; it is very soft. Unfortunately, one of the two in the pair was the incorrect size despite the package saying the correct size. The one that was the correct size fit as expected."
5.0,It fit very well on my  boy
5.0,"I'm a 5'3 120lbs adult who's worn boys underwear since I was teenager.. I got several pair of these in the boys 16-18 and they fit so well! I don't have a package so I appreciate that there's no extra pouch or seam in the front. And they look super cute on me, definitely date underwear."
5.0,Super cute and comfortable.
5.0,These are very soft and my 5 year old LOVES them.
1.0,My son has always worn the same size in boxer briefs but these were huge on him.
2.0,Too form fitting
5.0,My son always complains about his underwear till I bought him theses. They are pricey but well worth it.
5.0,"I bought these in size XS (4-5) for my 3 year old. They are a little big, but they work and will fit him for a year or two. Great quality!"
5.0,My son loves these! Very comfortable and doesn't stretch or loosen after wearing them all day.
5.0,"A friend bought these on my account, he says they held up well, were comfortable, and fit great."
4.0,I like the style. Gotta get the next larger size.
5.0,"Very nice, fit is good"
2.0,No dong room
5.0,"Even at 12, my kid asks for CK undies!"
2.0,These ride straight up the butt. My son hates them.
5.0,Great buy! Fits perfect
4.0,I like these boxer briefs for my 5 yr old son. They fit well and last beautifully (he outgrows them before they stretch or tear). And because they fit snugly they don't bunch up under his pants like other styles can do.  He is 5 and wears the 6/7.
5.0,5 STAR !!!!!

5.0,"My boys love these. I have a sturdy 8 year old and a very slight 11 year old. They both fit comfortably into the size large. Well made, nice inseam length."
5.0,Bought these for my son.  He says they are very comfortable and well made!
4.0,These boxer shorts hold up to s*** stains well.
4.0,My husband has these exact boxer briefs. He liked them so much i bought them for my boys. They are great quality however they shrunk so much they no longer fit. They only were able to wear 1 time. Get them but order bigger size.
5.0,It fits perfectly and the quality is fantastic!
4.0,Run a little bit small
5.0,;)
3.0,These fit small....
5.0,Great quality my son now has 8 pairs
5.0,"im a 19 year old, 155 pound girl. i like wearing boxers but i don't want the baggy crotch hole than mens underwear have. this fit perfect and are great."
5.0,"these model of underwear from calvin ""climbs"" (as my son calls them) can come large but shrink in wash the 1st time. I believe it can vary with colors for some reason. Its almost like the gray and whites are prewashed, and brighter colors are not. Also BE WARNED the bright colored ones will bleed color one 1st wash. These white and grays didn't seem to bleed any white or gray. ;-)

Had hard time with fruit of the loom, starter, and others always bunching up in sons rear end. We found these calin kleins 9including other listings and colors) to be excellent, but also have a couple ""lucky & me"" underwears. These fit looser while the lucky & me fit tighter. Oddly my son likes the tighter ones for sleeping and the looser ones for the day and school. I suppose for being active he likes looser fit."
4.0,These are nice briefs but my son prefered the cotton CK briefs.
4.0,My son loves these.
5.0,Excellent

5.0,Nice and soft. True to size.
5.0,Very confortable!!
5.0,Great product but do order a size up. My child is usually 8/10 and I ordered 12/14 and they are a perfect fit. The material is soft and not tight around the legs. Highly recommend.
4.0,I ordered a size M for my tall skinny 9 year old and they fit him just fine.  Fabric is nice and he's complaining.
5.0,"Absolutely incredible, just like his daddy wears, made potty training a breeze."
5.0,Best underwear ever. My son wears a 4T. he is right at 40lbs. and the size small fits him best. I love these underwear. they are super soft and hold there shape all day and never stretch out.
5.0,"perfect, very good, I like"
5.0,My son LOVES these and won't wear any other brand now. Have had to reorder since I found out he was wearing them for multiple days

5.0,These are the best boxers ever!  Our 3 year old absolutely loves them!  The have withstood everything!  He is a very hot bodied kid and these seem to keep him cooler!
5.0,Love it
5.0,"bought the 8/10 and it fit a bit too small went back and bought the 16/18 and it fits great. I love these, they are so comfortable and cute. I'm a girl btw and 119lbs and 5'5 so I have to buy the boys instead of men underwire because that won't fit. I love it so much I even wear the 8/10 that I bought, fits small but is too cute to give away. absolutely love them."
5.0,"My 8 year old was constantly adjusting himself while wearing briefs, I bought these in hopes that he would be more comfortable and he's  wearing a size 8 jeans now, I like the CK brand because their medium ranges 8-10 where a lot of brands like HANES are 10-12. These boxer briefs are a great product and he seems more comfortable wearing them and we have found the size perfect."
5.0,My sone loves these. Caused him to switch from boxers.
5.0,Perfect! Just what I was looking for!
5.0,"My son is only 10, but he has cool underwear.  Don't put your kids in underoos or tighty whiteys.  Boxer briefs are better, but the long legs on them are cumbersome.  These trunks are perfect.  They are a great fit, soft, stretchy and supportive.  Very comfortable and they look cool."
5.0,My 6yr old son is slender in size. The size 6/7 for good with a little room to spare. Fabric is very soft and comfortable.
5.0,This fits my 7 year old son perfect fit
5.0,"My son loves these, so comfy."

5.0,"My son like them and I""m very happy with it."
5.0,Thank
4.0,It's for little ones with small rumps. They work for one of my sons but the other complains that they're too tight. They have a pleasant cotton feel about them and I like the fact that they are not too long. Compared to the Carter's ones we've been using they are much more snug and the fabric is less thick. I haven't been using them for long so I don't know how they hold up in the wash.
5.0,Fits as expected. Good quality and shipped fast.
5.0,Fit as expected.
5.0,Nice Product

5.0,Very good quality. Wonderful.colours (as shown )
5.0,All the kids underwear with my son's favorite characters were so rough and chafed his legs that we decided to purchase these since they are similar to his Dad's. He has taken right to them and has had no skin issues. I prefer the satin like material of the other pair but these are a little longer and a little looser so it's much easier for him to get on and off himself. For reference I bought the 4/5 and my son is 38 lbs.
4.0,These are a little on the small side BUT I wasn't surprised since my husband wears CK underwear and these are cut similar to a pair he's had in the past. They're suppose to be snug and just cover everything. My son doesn't seem to mind he's just happy to have underwear like Daddy's but I prefer the other pairs I ordered with the slightly longer legs. For reference my son is 38 lbs and I bought the 4/5.
5.0,fit as expected and feels good. a bigger size would be great but they ran out so it fits close but the size cart is accurate. I love it
5.0,"Loved it, fits just like it should, loved the colors. Plan on purchasing more."
5.0,"Second time buying these
They are soft and my son says they are comfortable ( he is picky).
They hold well, the others we have are different colors but they still look good after a year of use, just now starting to look old.
They are smaller than Hanes or Fruit the Loom, in length.
I buy two sizes larger for my son than his age always because he has a big bottom."
5.0,I purchased these for my son and he has no complaints.
5.0,Great product. We have bought this brand and style for a few years. I sometimes find them hard to find the kids sizes so finding them online at the same price as a discount store
5.0,liked these so this was our 2nd order
5.0,Soft material. Very comfortable.
1.0,"lIght weight, nice colors, but way too snug.  My 5th grader fits in an XL..."
2.0,These fit really funny.  They are too big in the waistband and too small in the butt.  I have briefs in the same size and they fit nothing alike.
5.0,Super soft and fits my slender waisted sons body perfectly. He loves them
5.0,"I just bought another pack, perfect for my 13 yr old athlete son."

5.0,I should start this review by clarifying I am a 21-year-old woman and I bought these for myself.  They're great and super soft and comfortable!! I'm a women's size 25/0 and bought X 12-14.
5.0,These are just too cute. Definitely recommend
5.0,Just as expected.
5.0,Everything was as advertised! Would buy from again.
1.0,I have been buying Calvin Klein underwear for my little 4 year old grandson for about 2 years now. He is outgrowing his and ready for the next size. Calvin Klein underwear does run small and these are no exception. My grandson is about 43 inches tall and weighs about 44 pounds. He has been wearing the Small 6/7 for well over a year and is just now outgrowing them. Unfortunately I've had a really hard time finding these undies in a boys medium 8-10. I stumbled across these on Amazon and purchased them with high hopes. They arrived and they seemed just ok. I washed them and immediately noticed that they were not the same quality of his current Calvin Klein's. The material on these is a rougher and thinner. The waistband is an itchy nuisance to my grandson. So I'm thinking that these are either fake or their quality control needs an overhaul. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing again
5.0,"My son love it.
excellent quality, good texture."
5.0,"Nice! My son is 11years old,wearing 12-14 yards fit,close to the skin,not loose,we are like it"
5.0,Love these - like big boy boxers for toddlers. Soft and stretchy material and like the fact that they are not long.
5.0,Super soft cotton.
5.0,I bought these for my grandsons age 10 and 7 yrs old ... At the same time my daughter bought them Hanes and the Hanes are unraveling already but not the CK boxer briefs !!!! They are sturdy that's for sure !!! I recommend them for all boys and men too!!!
5.0,As expected. Quick shipping as a Prime customer.
5.0,Great fits perfectly
1.0,Too small
5.0,So cute. My son is tiny so the 4-5 fit great and a little loose but didn't know if they would shrink. They did a tad. He is 4 and look like grown up undies
5.0,My son loved how soft and smooth the cotton is. The size 8-10 was perfect to s slim boy.
5.0,These fit as expected after quite a few washes they did shrink a little bit. They are made of cotton instead of stretchy material.
5.0,Like the softness and good quality.
4.0,"Ordered a Medium got a large, Still fits"
5.0,Exactly what was Expected

5.0,Very soft and delivered as promised.
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,I was hesitant to buy because of price but thought they were cute!  I am not disappointed.  These are just adorable on my 4 year old!  He looks like such a little man!  I couldn't resist the bold colors and he thinks the colors are great too.  The fabric is super soft and not scratchy like many of the box store pack of undies.  Shape holds up well even after a long day of play.  He will be wearing these for a few years yet.  Mom is happy and he is as well...win win!

4.0,Product was very nice.  Good material.  I just ordered the wrong size
5.0,"My son won't wear any other underwear now!  These Calvin Klein underwear are great once you get the sizing down....  My son is 9 years old and 5'1"" with an athletic build and he needs the boys XL, though he usually would wear just a large.  You have to size up on these otherwise they will ride up in the back."

5.0,"My husband is a 28x30 (I know, hes very thin) and these fit him great! even a little loose. So if you have a skinny hubby, remember these!"

5.0,A+++++
5.0,Great Quality!
5.0,"I was seriously worried after reading many of the reviews complaining about the size. However they were wrong!!
The size is just perfect and it can easily stretch if needed. The quality, color and everything is superior to brands with the same price tag.
If the size says 8/10. Then expect them to fit an average body size of age 8/10yo. If you cant tell whether your child is over the natural growth rate<which is a good thing> or not,  then don't order the size based on the age only and then complain.

Just perfect"
5.0,Awesome
5.0,Awesome
3.0,size up
5.0,"These fit my 9 yr old son perfectly (he is 55 inches tall & weighs 75 pounds). We bought the 12/14 size. He said they are very soft and comfortable. He loves that they say 'Calvin Klein' on them ""just like Marty Mcfly's did."""

5.0,"Only underwear my son will wear. These do run small to give you an idea he is 5'6"" and weighs 110lbs, he fits into the 16/18 perfectly. Also know these aren't as long as boxer briefs."
5.0,"The only boxer briefs that fit my four-year-old son (who is tall for his age) the way underwear should fit, not too long or too tight, the material is really nice, and the colors are nice and vibrant. These helped my son to finally potty train because he was excited to pick the color of underwear he wanted to wear that day. My son can put them on with ease and they're easy to pull up and down."

4.0,"Nice boxers, they are a little thin and run a bit on the small side, but they do fit.  My son likes them and they are great for summer time wear under shorts since they are a lighter material."
5.0,"omg, these are so darn cute!!!!! my son is almost 4 years old and is just now fitting into SOME 4T sizes. i was so sick of buying disney underwear for him and thought id try to xs size calvin kleins... i thought they would be too big, but OMG THEY ARE PERFECT!!!! i think they fit so well because they are the ""trunk"" style. i love them and im so happy hes not in paw patrol undies any more hahaha."
4.0,"I accidently bought these. i thought they were the trunk underwear, not the boxer briefs. these run bigger than the trunk undies, even in waist band size. still cute undies. but an xs is too big for my toddler who wears 4T"

5.0,As described.  Happy with purchase
5.0,"I'm an adult but I'm small so buying boy's is a nice way to save money. Sometimes that plan fails because a lot of children clothing is made somewhat cheaply. These boxer briefs are soft and comfortable and made of a good material. They don't ride up when I wear them. I would say that the only downside is that the elastic band is skinner than I am used to. However, these are great underwear and I've already purchased more in different colors."
5.0,Nice!
5.0,"My son has went through a few brands of underwear, Hanes, those cute disney and marvel ones, GAP, The Children's Place, etc. While these are slighty pricer than those (really not by much at all), these are probably the only ones that he loves. They do not ride up and holds very well in the washing machine. We line dry all of our clothes so I cannot attest to how well they would hold up in the dryer. I am happy to sacrifice a few more dollars so I do not have to hear him complain about underwear in his butt."

3.0,"I feel like these fit a bit small. My son put them on and he sure looks like a CK model with these snug in the leg and butt undies. I'm not a fan of briefs on boys or tight undergarments in general so the boxer briefs he usually wears are a bit looser. I like the CKs, I just know for next time that I'll prob go one size bigger than he is."

Because many people are confused which size to choose my Suggestion: refer to the pounds shown in the chart, not the letter size and years. As we all know kids are different so there is no way 9-10 years old boy that weights 90 pounds, to fit in size M ...it  will be small."

2.0,My son is a very slim size 12 and the large was way too small.
5.0,great undies. Buy 2 sizes bigger
4.0,I ordered the black ones of these and they fit my son great. These for some reason were a little inconsistent size wise. One fit fine and the other was a little tighter. Overall they loosened a little and he decided he wanted to keep them. I liked the color variety but overall probably would have just gotten all black instead.
5.0,"Ordered one pack of these for my son and he loved them so much, I ordered 3 more packs! Fits great and holds up well. Check out other colors too!"
5.0,My Son Loves these its almost time to buy more so comfortable - retain their shape - great color -  and there is no thick trim around the leg
5.0,My sons love these.
5.0,"These are my son's favorite. Great fit the only thing that made me sad is the yellow doesn't stay yellow for long.. next time I will make sure they are separated from the darks better. ""son in laundry training""-)  These do not have the thicker trim around the leg and I believe they are more comfortable for him"
5.0,these are great. my son is 3 1/2 years old. he weighs about 36lbs. and size XS 4/5 fits he perfect. they are very soft and great quality.

5.0,He thinks they are great!
5.0,Super comfortable!
5.0,My son actually LIKES his underwear now. Says they are comfy!
5.0,I wish they were longer is what my 8 year old says.  They are very comfy though.
5.0,My sons loves these. They are his favorites.
5.0,Happy with product
3.0,I like the look of this but I was thinking it would be more spandex-y instead of cotton. It also runs very small and my 11-year-old (regular-sized) boy is too big for the XL size I bought. I figured reading the reviews that they would run small so I ordered up but once I was these they'll probably be too small as they are already too short and look like briefs almost.
5.0,my boys love these boxers... nice colors too!
5.0,"My son LOVES these and now prefers Calvin Klein (his ""fancy"" underwear) to all other brands."
5.0,Very much recommended.
5.0,"My little guys new favorite to wear.  This was exactly what I was looking for, something comfortable that fit him."

5.0,Great quality!
5.0,My son loves these underwear. They're good quality and they last long.
5.0,"I always bought Gap underwear for my son because he is slim and talk so the fit was nice, but these are even better! Will be ordering more!"
3.0,"These are a decent cheap alternative for guys who are more slim built. They are a bit tighter in the legs, but the fabric is stretchy so unless you have fairly built legs it should be ok. However, if you're more ""gifted"" I would go with your standard men's size that works for you. Overall, decent cheaper alternative to standard men's CK trunks."
5.0,Very comfortable and good quality.  Will be buying more of these.
5.0,Great
5.0,Great
5.0,"Fit a little tight and I got a large , got them earlier than expected but also on the same day."
5.0,Very soft!
5.0,I'm 16 Years old and shop for my own clothes. I have every type of underwear from boxers to briefs to boxer briefs and enjoy them all. I was looking for something that looked good. I found these and they fit perfectly. I still prefer the CK briefs but these are amazing to wear for all the support you could need.
4.0,fits on the slimmer side...I was looking for a longer fit but these are okay.
3.0,Too small
4.0,My sons love these CK boxer briefs. They are soft and not bulky. They fit small compared to other brand's boxer briefs in the same size. Beware! They will shrink if you wash them in hot water or dry them on high. I can't give them five stars because of this shrinkage. Pricey children's underwear should not shrink.

4.0,Excellent
5.0,Very Good product
4.0,"I don't know if these are real Calvin Klein, as there are a lot of hardly noticeable flaws in the underwear but my almost 4 year old loves them and they don't ride up or bunch up like a lot of his other briefs. These are adorable and worth the price."
5.0,Excellent
5.0,Perfect fit for my little one. Soooo cute.
1.0,too small
5.0,"Nice quality but run small. My son is 9 going on 10, average size and the 12/14 just fits him with not much room to grow. I am glad I ordered a size bigger."

3.0,Product is great but size way off.  13 yo extremely thin son so used sizing chart.  Large should have been perfect but was way too small..as they do not stretch a lot
5.0,Love these for my 4 year old..  I purchased a few different colors/designs.  He calls these his comfy ones!
5.0,Love these for my big 3yr old
5.0,Fit my 10 year old sun perfectly. They look great and he loves them! Would buy again definitely!
5.0,"I got these for my 7 year old son who is a fan of Back to the Future. If you saw the movie (who hasn't???), you know what I mean. He was thrilled and they are too stinkin' cute for words! On that same note, my little guy is growing up and out of his cartoon undies. :("
2.0,Ordered for my son who is about a size 14 but this style runs small.
5.0,Perfect Fit for my litle men
3.0,Could use better size details. Cotton soft and comfy.
1.0,These boxer briefs are way too small.  They look like they would fit a 5 year old.  We ordered a size 16/18.  Don't make the same mistake we did
5.0,"These are the BEST little boys underwear. My 3.5 year old wears boxer briefs and had been wearing Gymboree's. They were all getting worn out in the elastic and too small (he was still wearing the 2T-3T).  I went back to the jury store to get him some more, and much to our dismay, they stop making the boxer briefs, and only had the regular briefs.  I was so disappointed as I didn't want to buy him the regular underwear, and I didn't want to go to just Walmart or Target and buy him some cheap boxer briefs that weren't going to last long either. So I did what I always do and I got on Amazon and started browsing their selection. I came across these along with another kind, and I ended up ordering two sets of these. My son was super excited because these match his daddy's LOL and they are very great quality as well, and exceptional value. 2 pairs for $8.99! We were paying $9.99 a piece (a little less if we had a coupon) at Gymboree once upon a time. These are Calvin Klein- way better! I have another little boy 2 years younger, so I am all about quality as we are passing everything down. I don't want to have to buy things twice if I don't have to. I'm confident these will be passed down no problem!"
5.0,These are all my teenager will wear. They fit well and keep their shape through tons of washes
5.0,thanks you
4.0,a gift for my boy
5.0,Great for my son!
5.0,Good fit.
5.0,As expected!
5.0,Very good!!

5.0,"Well made, fit right and no more complaining of having to wear tighty whities!"
1.0,very bad
2.0,much smaller than what's expected.  large is more like a small.  very tight/compression
5.0,Thankful for the reviews telling me to order a larger size than normal.  My son loves the bright colors.

5.0,"Got these for my son, he has worn this brand for a long time. They fit well, are comfortable and last a long time, They outlasted him.... he outgrew his old ones so we replaced them all with the same thing he has been wearing for the past few years, Calving Klein. I highly recommend."
5.0,"You can't go wrong with Calvin Klein! Except maybe buy a size larger, mine are snug but still a whole lot more comfortable than what I used to wear"
5.0,As advertised. Good quality
5.0,My son was very happy with these! Fit just as expected and have so far lasted very well.

5.0,no issues
5.0,"Good fit, good styling and great color choices. Nice thin material and washing well so far"
5.0,Perfect.  They still fit the same even after several washings.  We have used fruit of the loom (hated) and also children's place (loved) in the same style and these are on par with CP's.  I plan on buying more.
5.0,Perfect fit.
4.0,"Great trunks! Love the material, but these trunks run pretty small. I bought their largest size & still felt snug. I've noticed some shrinkage after a few good washes & that doesn't help either (after I placed a 2nd order of course). Won't be able to purchase this product in the future."
5.0,Good quality. Son likes them.
5.0,Fits as expected.  My son loves it.
4.0,Thanks
5.0,Excellent product.
5.0,Great fit . Love love love these shorts
1.0,"I bought these  boxers after having confirmed size only to discover that the size is for small boys. Now I can't even get to wear them, I need to find some teenage boys to give these to them. These boxers are meant to be in the kids section."
5.0,I bought these for my daughter. She has a rather large backside and girls underware do not cover her sufficiently. She loves these. They are very comfortable and fit her very well.
5.0,"All three of my boys love these!  They are thin, light and soft."
1.0,Hobbit boxers
5.0,he loves them!
4.0,Love it. Plus it's a cheap alternative to adult Calvin Klein underwear. If your skinny and this can't fit you. Buy it.
5.0,"The only underwear my son wears. It runs small so buy a size up.  They last good, and nice fit for boys."
5.0,"These boxers are great for a boy who wishes to try boxers for the first time.  They are form fitting yet flexible.  The cotton material is very soft and they do not bunch in the crotch.  The legs stay where they are supposed to and don't ride up.  My son now has six pairs of these in gray, white, orange and orange/gray stripes.  Colors are vivid yet did not run in the wash.  Overall he loves them and won't ever go back to tighty-whiteys."
3.0,Didn't like the gold detail for boys
5.0,Cotton is so soft and gentle.
5.0,
5.0,"My 9-year-old son loves these!  They run a little small.  We had ordered the next size down when he was younger, so we knew what to expect.  I ordered a size larger than I normally would."
5.0,My son said his briefs looks and feels good.
5.0,great fit
5.0,super love them.
5.0,My 4 year old loves these.  He says these are the comfy ones..  I purchased a few pairs..  Fits nice
3.0,These run very small and they shrink!
5.0,"Super cute and a great price. My son finds these really comfortable - though I ould note that the fit is definitely a slim fit. My son fits the 4/5 - but he is only just four. We will need the next size well before he is 5.
I would recommend sizing up in these."
3.0,They fit my son too small.  He liked them other than that.
4.0,"My son loves these, but they are a bit tighter than he likes.  I wouldn't order these for him again because of the tightness.  He liked everything else about them, they just didn't work for him."
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,Awesome!
4.0,"Seems a little on the small size, but I like the soft material and elastic band"
4.0,"My five year old loves these. Funny, but he likes them better than batman briefs, superman, etc. ya know you got a successful product when a five year old chooses it over superheroes."
5.0,My son likes!!
5.0,Comfy as usual.  We are a Calvin Klein family.
5.0,Comfy
5.0,love the quality and the looks . It fits perfectly. Really great product .

1.0,These are tiny--at least a full size too small.
5.0,"I ordered one size up, as was recommended by previous reviews. One size up fit great. Quality was also very good."
5.0,LOVE IT
3.0,This was waaaaaay too tight for my small 10 year old. Go a size up to get a good fit.
5.0,Very good fit and user says comfy.
5.0,love these for our 6 year old
5.0,"My son loves the fit, feel and look of this product."
5.0,"Because my son is very skinny, the waist is little big. However, it fits as expected."
5.0,"As an adult male who has a 29 or 30 inch waist these offer a cheaper solution for comfortable underwear. The fabric texture is great and they fit my tiny bum great. For an adult, the front side fits as expected when wearing boys briefs. They maintain their shape throughout the day however the legs tend to bunch up some."
5.0,I got these in 14-16 even though my son is a 10-12 because the reviews said they were a little small. they fit nicely (he doesn't like tight fitting underwear). He says they're soft and comfortable.
4.0,Love these. So much better than the character ones widely available for children. My son is only comfortable in these PLUS they are like daddy's!
5.0,EXCELLENT
1.0,Nice material but very small for a husky boy.

5.0,Son loves these.
5.0,"Excellent, my son loves them."
5.0,"I bought these for my son his 12 yrs old and thinner side, 12 to 14 fits perfect and he loves these boxer briefs."
5.0,"Son loves these. I bought a couple sizes larger going on the other reviews and they fit great. My son is a strong sporty build, very muscular for an 8 year old. He usually wears size M in clothing; underwear he likes the L in Hanes and in Calvin Klein's he is wearing an XL. He likes his clothes more lose fitting. He could definitely fit the larges, but the XL fits him more the way he likes them. They are very soft and my picky son loves them. Colors are great."
5.0,"I bought these cute boxers for my skinny 8 year old and after washing and drying in dryer, they fit perfectly. We both like them a lot. I bought more and will buy again for sure."
4.0,I got the smallest size 4-5 yr old. My child is 3 and a half and these are a tad big but they don't fall down. The colours are great! Nice material and are well made.
3.0,Waaay too small. Will use for futur children!
5.0,Stays vibrant after many washes

4.0,My son is a husky size and was afraid on ordering the wrong size. Size runs on point real happy the way they fit on snugg
4.0,Ok
5.0,My son loved the fit and color!
4.0,I forgot boxers are for guys and sometimes guys have somewhat smaller butts haha
4.0,Good soft material and elastic. Is somewhat on the small size. If you want a little comfortable fitting and room to grow :) buy a size up.
5.0,We like ut
5.0,"touch good, and the size is okay"
5.0,"My son is tall and slim and I just recently stopped having to buy him slim sized clothing.  These are by far the most comfortable underwear he has ever had. He converted my husband to him too. I was shocked the first time I bought them, that they run so small. My 12-14 slim. Kid needs 16-18 in these. He doesn't like them loose or baggy. A smaller size looks ridiculous and is uncomfortable.  This was the same from medium size on up. The first pack that I bought had to be handed down. Good thing they are awesome and have lasted except for the black, which fades tremdously."
5.0,"fit as expected ,  colors were ok  and  these are really soft !!!!!"
5.0,My son reports that they are very comfortable.
5.0,Awesome underwear - fits perfectly!
5.0,Awesome underwear - fits perfectly!
5.0,"I ordered the size 6/7 for my almost 4-year-old boy. He had the size 4/5 in a different brand & they were getting too snug & uncomfortable for him. These fit as expected because my son is big for his age. The 6/7 has plenty of growing room & he loves the boxer brief style because they are ""like daddy's"". I got him two 2-packs of these and he is so stinking cute in his new Calvin Kleins!"
5.0,good
5.0,"I bought these for my son and he loves them. Boxer briefs for a young boy makes him feel grown up for some reason. I guess it's that getting away from the tighty wighties that makes him feel that way. But overall, great product. I will definitely continue buying my boys this brand."
1.0,Too small. Didn't realize it was for boys.
4.0,Too tight...
1.0,I bought X-Large and it just a medium
5.0,its very good
5.0,My 10 year old loves these!
5.0,Fits really nice. No complaints. Cheap and sweet.
5.0,"Even though they are for male, they are comfy!"
5.0,Comfortable and fit nicely. Great value for young guys that can fit boys XL
5.0,"Really liked these boxer-briefs, fits a 28-30 inch young mans waist well. Great value if you fit boys XL, as mens CK underwear is expensive"
4.0,"I feel that the briefs provide more support than the boxer briefs because they are shorter than the boxer briefs. I needed to pull the boxer briefs a little above my waist to get the same support and coverage below. Aside from that slight discrepancy in sizing I'm rather happy with the boxer briefs. They are comfortable and provide the coverage I want, which I wasn't getting with briefs."
5.0,Fit my 10 year son perfect. But he is also a big boy.
5.0,"Very soft, my son loves these. very comfortable waste band."
5.0,"Having a hard time finding good boxer briefs for my 8 year old, so we tried these along with several others (Adidas, Hanes, Fruit of the Loom), and these are his favorite.  Verrry soft to the touch and fit nicely."
4.0,"I ordered size 8-10 for a 71/2 y/o boy, taller than average. After initial wash only he keeps tugging down on the leg making me think they are too snug for comfort, although he says they are fine. I am ordering 12-14 to see if they will feel better."
2.0,Through the waist they fit but the legs were too short per my son.  He likes for them to come further down his thigh than these did.  They were good quality though.
5.0,Interiors are great for children. All exactemente same as advertised. I thank the seller for his responsibility in all aspects.

5.0,"SEXY LITTLE BRIEF UNDERWEAR, SAYS MY SON. HE LOVES THEM. AFTER I WASHED THEM AND COMPARED THEM TO FRUIT OF THE LOOMS, DC'S, AND OTHER BRANDS HE HAS, THEY ARE NOT MADE AS WELL AS THE CHEAPER BRANDS ARE MADE. IT'S ALL IN THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT, WHO MADE IT???? WHAT NAME BRAND IS IT???? I PERSONALLY GO FOR THINGS THAT LOOK GOOD, FIT GOOD AND I DO NOT CARE WHAT NAME IS ON IT, OR EVEN IF THERE IS A NAME ON IT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY FOR MY KIDS, AND OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW. THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE DESIGNER NAME, A HIGH END BRAND NAME, WHATEVER. SO YES, THESE ARE CUTE, THEY ARE MADE SEMI GOOD, AND THEY COST MORE TWICE AS MUCH AS FRUIT OF THE LOONS, DC'S, ARIZONA'S, HANES."
5.0,good

5.0,Ok.

5.0,good
5.0,excelente
5.0,"Love them. They do run small, my son wears a 2T/3T in other brands and the 4/5 fits him great in these."
5.0,My son will not use any other underwear.  It fits like a glove and is not uncomfortable on any part of his body.  Cotton is the best fiber to wear especially in such vulnerable areas.  Did you know that your skin absorbs all the chemicals of the artificial clothing you wear?
1.0,"They are too small !!! :)
Thank you"
5.0,"perfect fit, love the material, would definitely buy again"
4.0,These are great quality but a little tight.

4.0,Fit boys size 7/8 well
5.0,"11 year old son was apprehensive, but he is very happy with them! He's 5 ft 110 lbs"
5.0,"My almost 4 year old son is very picky about his underwear and socks.  He hates clothes that are scratchy or have thick seams. He also loves bright colors, especially pink.  Now, These are *not* seam free, but they don't bother him.  (I can't tell you how many times he puts on a pair of undies in the morning, squats down, shakes his head, takes them off and gets a new pair....)  I see these on him frequently, so they pass the test more mornings than not.

I found them to be true to size, based on the size chart.  He wears size 5t or 4/5 in Carter's & Oshkosh."

4.0,"My son is shy, so I screwed up and got him some not-plain grey unders.  And he won't wear these.  Peer pressure to fit in won out today...  But they are well made and look nice."
4.0,"A bit thin, but the fit is nice and they look great. He loves the bright colors and that they look like Dad's."
1.0,"Great underwear , my son loves them but, I ordered large because of the reviews and guess what? The are still verrrry tight on my son. So since he likes them so much I ordered another pair in the X-LARGE. He would normally wear a medium in a Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. 2 sizes over get my drift. 4 stars because of the miss sizing. It causes issues when Asian sizing is mixed in into American culture which is what this is. Stuff being made by and size labeling by non Americans.

A month later and the elastic waistband is separating from the bottom material.
Do not recommend!"
5.0,My son loves these.  Very comfortable and a great price.
5.0,I bought the 16/18 for my 14 year old son. He is 5'6' and 110 so tall and skinny. These fit perfectly. If you have a husky child with larger thighs I doubt that these will fit. Quality good and wash well.
3.0,too small
4.0,Kind of small
4.0,reasonable
5.0,"Without sounding overly enthusiastic about boys underwear, I have been trying a lot of variations and for my judicious son, these are the ones! Very light, high-quality elastic cotton - not too heavy of a weight. He wants to sleep in just these and wears them with great joy every day they are so comfortable. He's on the slighter side and despite being 8, these work perfectly."
2.0,I was really disappointed in these.  My 7 yr. old son has other CK boxer briefs (size small) and they always fit great. I bought the Med but they appeared to be smaller than the ones I had.
5.0,My 8-year-old boy loves these boxers. They are comfortable and fit perfectly!

5.0,These underwear fit as expected.  Material is not thin as in other brands.  Were purchased for a very slim 12 year old.  He loves the color and fit.
2.0,"My son is 2 years old I bought size 4,5 it's really tie for my son"
5.0,"Super soft. Son was boxers only, but now likes these."
5.0,It washes well and my son likes them as they are soft and comfortable.
5.0,"I read the other reviews that were too small so I bought my son a size bigger and they fit perfect.  I asked him how they were the first day he wore them and he said they felt like he didn't have any on, very comfortable!  I will be buying more."
5.0,Good
5.0,Good!
5.0,Great boys underwear! So far they are holding up well and washing well.
4.0,"Based on the sizing chart, my slim 14 year old is at the lower end of the scale for the 16/18 size. The 16/18 fit him perfectly. Unless your child is slim then I do not think that these boxers will fit. My son has slim legs and the legs are a snug fit. The quality of the fabric is not as thick as mens CK underwear but it is soft and okay for the price."
5.0,"Both my 9 and 12 year old love these soft, boxer briefs.  The fit is true to size and unlike some brands they don't have  much shrinkage over time ( at least the length of time they actually are this size)...."
5.0,"While my boys usually don't care about the brand of the clothes they are wearing just yesterday i heard from my son "" mommy, do you have any CK underwear in a loundry room that you did not bring to my room yet?"". That tells it all. The fabric is very soft, the boxers look good and took already over 20 washes  and look new."
5.0,"My son loves the colors!! high-quality, what else would you expect from Calvin Klein?"
5.0,High-quality what else would you expect from Calvin Klein

5.0,"My son is very active in sports and recreation and has told me he really prefers boxer briefs over briefs to avoid the ""wedgies"".  He had been wearing Hanes, Fruit of the Loom but he needed to go up from a S to a M and we saw these on Amazon. He liked the color choices (this review is for the black and red, but there are many bright colors also) so I humored him; i.e. the initial motivation for the purchase was almost irrelevant.

The important thing is that he loves them for the soft feel, comfort and they are high quality. They are truly *super* soft and hold their shape.  We liked them so much we threw out his Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and bought him three more pairs of these, enough for a week.  They are more expensive but really are worth it."
5.0,"My son likes these, says they are comfortable. According to the size chart, he was in between sizes, so I went up a size which was a good idea as these extra large are just a bit larger than a cheaper brand's medium. The colors are bright. Since we just received them I can not yet comment on durability, but the fabric feels strong."
5.0,Perfect starter under ware for toddlers.
5.0,Very nice and fashionable but they run quite a bit small.
5.0,good
4.0,"Yes,"
5.0,Fit just just right. Happy with the colors and the delivery. 5 stars overall.
4.0,"The blue one, which fits me well, is a little larger than the red one, small for me to wear. So I gave the red to a family member, who blame me for spending money to buy these. The material is great. Feel comfortable in the blue one. By the way,  Amazon.com is the best online shopping site I've ever known. I'm a foreigner, envy your Americans."
4.0,Great but a little small. Will get the XL

5.0,"I just bought the size 6/7 for my slender (about 46 pounds) 6 1/2  year old and they are a perfect on him now. I don't see them fitting him in 13 more months. He told me they were softer than another brand we just bought, so I'm picking up another package of the Calvin Klein boxer briefs today."
5.0,good quality! very comfortable
5.0,"I bought them for my 12 year old boy, he likes them, the quality is good, will keep on buy more."
5.0,my sons LOVES these! they are so soft and comfy that I got him the other packs of different colors. these are the ONLY ones he will wear now!
4.0,"Great trunks at a great price.  It might not be obvious in the picture but the waistband is gold, worth a mention, I thought it was grey!
They do seem a little small but our older boy is a skinny minny so not a problem for us."
2.0,"The description says these are 95% cotton and 5% elastane.  I was expecting smooth stretch trunks for my boy however I was really disappointed to find they are 100% cotton rib.  Nowhere near as nice as Cotton/Elastane which they were advertised as.

Not worth my time returning such a low cost item from Australia."
2.0,"I thought these boxers were great, but my son thinks they're too tight around legs and ""fit funny"" in the crotch.  So even though they are good quality cotton and well-sewn, they had to go back when he refused to wear them."
5.0,"This is the second time I purchase this underpants for my son, he loves them and they fit perfect we'll keep buying this style"
4.0,My son is growing out of underwear so fast!  so I ordered the largest available and they fit great!  If I had ordered the actual size he wears then they would have been to small!  always go larger they will grow into them!
5.0,"These are some of the most comfortable underwear that I own. They fit well and look good. The elastane in the fabric keeps them well-fitting, unlike some boxer briefs that become baggy after a half day. They are great to just wear around the house.

Just be aware that these boxer briefs are sold in boy's sizes. That is why they are so inexpensive. An X-large will fit about a 34 waist."
5.0,They look nice and work well for active boys. They come in other fun colors and seem to last a long time.
5.0,My son like these these boxer briefs they are made of good material I would order them again and recommend them
3.0,"I'm a size 36 in pants.

5.0,"Got these for my 12 year old son. As everything this year he wanted something bright and those are very nice in cool or and quality. The material is nice not too thin like it happens sometimes, they fit well and stay in good shape and color after wash. Good purchase."
4.0,"They are the new fad apparently, my son loves the colors. I am thinking about ordering more in the future."
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, nice fit around the legs.  Just note, the white pair is a bit see through from back."
3.0,"The sizing is a joke. My 12 year old has always been on the 50% in growth charts, and these boxer briefs were so tight!  I think he lost the feeling in his leg when he put them on!  ....sigh....what a waste of money!"
4.0,"Love them but they do fit weird, they run on the small side.  Order these at leastva size or 2 bigger then normal!"
3.0,"These underwear are SO CUTE but pretty snug.  If you have a kid who is a little muscular or on the thick side, you may want to order a size up or two!"
5.0,"I was a bit nervous about some of the reviews regarding sizing. I measured my son and used the sizing chart to figure out his size, and they fit perfect! I'll be buying more, he loves how ""comfy"" they are."
4.0,"Bought this for my 7 years old son, but one of them (with the letters) fits well and the other one is too small ( gave them to my little nephew )."
5.0,So so cute! Soft fabric and a great fit for my slender 5 year old. He loves them and they wash well.
5.0,"the truth is that the findings by the sack boxer already has my son, and are excellent only that this time the biggest request"

1.0,Bought this for my just turned 10 year old son who is very skinny but tall and it was too small.
5.0,"Son loved them!  comfortable and soft, will buy more in other colors - wash well and fit is great.  love"
5.0,"More minimal in style so great for lower cut jeans (unless your kid likes that show your underwear look).  True to Calvin Klein reputation quality of the fabric is good and son likes the feel.  Fit is great.  This brand definitely his favorite and I tried out these, Jockey and Hanes."
4.0,I bought a bigger size though after reading the reviews. It is is a good buy. I would recommend it. Best
5.0,These fit my son comfortably and the fabric is great! He likes these a lot and I'll definitely be buying more for him.
4.0,"It's actually very elastic and I would say of good quality. But some may think it needs to be thicker to be considered good quality.

Good fit and comfy. Cheers."

3.0,Really pretty but was short - more like a choker with a tail than a long lariat.  I wish it was longer though - its really very nice.
3.0,This necklace is very beautiful but i thought it would be bigger. I probably should have read the dimensions before buying but it is still a beautiful piece. One of the other reviews mentioned that the necklace was long and hung down into her clevage but if it did she must be around 5'1 110 lbs because i am 6'2 and the necklace is just a couple inches shy of being a choker on me. Check the length with a measuring tape before you buy to be sure the length is right for you.  But overall it is a very beautiful necklace.
4.0,"Was skeptical on buying this item because I was worried it would look cheap, but it was beautiful.  Only trouble I have is adjust the length, often.  But definitely recommend."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, and doing some research i found it was $ well spent. It is identical to a Tiffany's necklace going for $250! Great Value!"
5.0,"This item is even prettier in person!  i can't wait for Christmas so I can actually wear it!

My only complaint is that I'm pretty busty, and the star falls into my cleavage sometimes, so for those top-heavy women out there, its something to think about."
5.0,This item looks just like the Tiffany's version that my sister wanted.  I can't wait to give this to her for Christmas!
5.0,The most delicate item i've ever found. it's very feminine. the perfect gift for any lady
5.0,"If you want the arch and heel support of a Birkenstock sandal in your shoe or boot, this is great."
3.0,"I purchased these for plantar fascitis.  Unfortunately these things feel like a concrete slab was poured into your shoe.  Even after wearing them for a long time, they never really softened up that much.

While they have helped the plantar they never completely solved the problem.  I started using New Balance motion control sneakers (model 1123) and they have helped dramatically.  Most importantly the NB are firm yet cushiony unlike the hard as a rock Birkenstocks.  The Birkenstock sandals provide more cushiony support.  The insoles and shoes lack the necessary support!"
2.0,not what I expected in a Birkenstock insert.
3.0,"Got these on recommendation.  Wear them occasionally.  Can't seem to get used to them.  Couldn't figure out left from right  will continue to give them a chance.  A little bulky for most shoes.
Bought for pf issues."
5.0,best supports you can buy in my opinion
5.0,Offers the best of support from Birkenstock and the best service from Amazon! Thank you.
5.0,"I've used the Birkobalance insoles  and really liked them, but these are even better!  I have patellar dislocation syndrome and finally realized that my feet were the likely cause.  These insoles provide the stability I need to keep my feet from pronating and have provided great relief for my knee!"
2.0,Not wide enough
5.0,I have worn these for years in my non-Birkenstock shoes. I needed a second pair to avoid so much changing from shoes to other shoes. They are great!!!
4.0,A second back up pair of the same orthodics I bought 20 years ago!
5.0,Love it
5.0,"I have had very bad plantar fasciitis for months.  I have tried different shoes, different insoles. Heat cold differnt pain relievers with nothing helping.  Some major brands made the problem worse.  The berkenstock insoles have made a major improvement.  In just three days of use I fell so much better.  I strongly recommend this product!"
5.0,"I have only worn these socks for a couple weeks, but they are just fantastic! I never thought twice about getting better socks than the standard type prior to this. They are warm (but not hot) and very comfortable. They just feel great all day long. I am on my feet a lot at work and I have noticed a difference in my comfort. I highly recommend them for anyone even considering getting new socks."
5.0,Bravo Wigwam for supporting American workers!  The quality of these socks are some of the best I have found!  I highly recommend you try them if you like quarter length socks for sports or work.
5.0,"These are expensive, but nicely cushioned and made of a fabric that makes them easy to slip on and off.  Best quarter length socks I have ever had"
4.0,"I tend to make holes in my socks quickly.  Alas these don't fare any better and actually wear out faster than the cheap cotton tube socks (the only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars).  They are amazingly comfortable.  I go out of my way to ensure I'm wearing wigwam's if I know I'll be standing a lot in a day.  Also excellent breathability for exercise.  I get noticeably reduced foot sweat / odor.  They're are not cheap, but even still they are definitely worth having a few pairs around."
5.0,Overall - a Great Buy! I bought these socks for a three-day Grand Canyon hike in the summer heat and they handled the harsh conditions very well for their light weight while keeping my feet as dry as possible. Great Product - Great Price!
5.0,"I can't believe I went so many years without owning good pairs of socks!

We were going on a trip to a warmer climate and I decided to try and find socks that would wick moisture away from my feet and keep me cool.

After some digging I decided on these socks and wow are they comfy!  They keep my feet nice and cool and also have a good softness to them.

Note:  The directions say to not use fabric softener when washing them which would make the wicking less effective.  The instructions also say to wash the socks inside out which get a little annoying as some debris tends to stay stuck on the outside of the sock during washing.  That being said I still think these socks are well worth the money and I will never go back to cheap socks."
5.0,These are my favorite socks. They look good with shorts and their grey color allows them to work with trail-running shoes and darker shorts. Those white socks tend to look a bit silly for people with tan-brown skin. I almost wear these exclusively. They hold up extremely well and seem to last for nearly a decade.
5.0,The socks behave exactly as advertized.  The fit my feet well.  They quickly remove moisture from perspiration. They are holding up well.
5.0,"I live in one of the hottest places in the world: Mohave Valley AZ, and we go around in shorts for a good part of the year. These are the best quarter length socks I have ever worn; good for work or play. The quarter length cover up my bony ankles and keep out debris when working in tennis shoes, which is normal. I have not been able to destroy a pair yet, while yanking them on (I am usually very successful at this). For full length socks, I recommend gold toe, although when old, they do not pass the yank test."
3.0,Too thick and loose fitting for my liking.
5.0,"I have a hard time finding good quality and good looking quarter length socks, especially for my size 14 feet.  Now that I've purchased and worn these cushioned Wigwam's for a few months, I'm sold on how well they've worn and will be purchasing a couple more pairs very soon."
4.0,"Somewhat large from 61/2 woman's size, but still a good fit, could be better and you just can't go wrong with wigwam for hiking socks!"
5.0,I've been on a US made sock-buying spree lately; trying to find socks that were dependably long lasting and comfortable for working on my feet all day.  I get 1 year from regular Wigwams.  Just out of curiosity I looked up when I bought this 1 pair--5 YEARS ago!  They're not the thickest socks but I may have to rethink buying Wigman Super 60 Quarter socks and just go with these.  (I just bought Thorlos and DuraBilt and a new pack of Wigman Super 60.  Let's see how long they all last.)
5.0,"Perfect for me ""as is"""
5.0,Bought these for my father & he loves them.
5.0,Lets you run without the blisters from sweat building up.
4.0,Very Comfy! had a great run!
2.0,These unisex socks are sized for men so consider sizing down from the recommended chart if you're a woman.
5.0,My socks I go to for my run. Love it for those over an hour and a half
5.0,light and works great
4.0,"When I got these I thought ""they are too thick, my feet will melt"" but I gave them a try and was pleasantly surprised to find that my feet stayed comfortable all day long. I also should have checked the difference between men's and women's sizes so mine are a bit on the large size though not enough to be an issue. So, I would recommend these to anyone who lives in a hot climate and needs to keep their feet comfortable while wearing sneakers or heavy shoes."
4.0,He likes these socks for running.
5.0,Great product comfy and good quality!
4.0,"I wear shoes size 12.5-13. I ordered several XL socks until now that fitted snug and nice. This sock was about 2-2.5 inches longer in it's loose form. I returned it because I suspected that after wearing and stretching them I'll end up with the heel part near my calfs  :)
Other than that the sock seems of very high quality."
5.0,"They are a little tall, but very good quality"
4.0,"Nice sock, fit is true to size."
5.0,comfortable
5.0,Bought for my husband and he was very happy with them. He wears a size 12 shoe and they fit well.
5.0,I bought xL  they fit real well other sizes to tight
5.0,Wigwam. Excellent as always. Say no more.
5.0,keeps my feet cool
5.0,My 10 year old ultimax were disintegrating and decided to try these. This may be the best summer sock I have found. Very comfortable even wet with sweat.  Tried a small order and then bought more to have enough for riding the bike 6 days a week. These are way better than the run of the mill off the rack socks at the bike store or sporting goods store.
5.0,My wife loves her new socks. She said they fit well and are very comfortable and in general feels great on her feet. What else is to be said. Highly recommend.
5.0,These are great runnings socks.  They are the perfect height to avoid socks slipping into your running shoes.  They wear well.
5.0,Great! Wore on the hike to the top of half dome and didn't receive one blister.
5.0,Will order more
5.0,"I love those socks. I think I have about 20 pairs of them now. I just keep buying them when my old onces (not this brand) wears off.
BTW. they are very durable. None of those that I have show any signs of wear."
5.0,They  came as expected and have fit as expected.  Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"I discovered a night and day difference between these and the typical department store brands. These Wigwams are the most comfortable socks for everyday activities. So I filled up my sock drawer entirely with these 5 years ago, all the same so it would be easy to find the pairs. So far not a single one of them has worn out or developed a hole from being worn and washed so many times. By now the regular socks would have started to unravel and develop holes. I am impressed by the durability. They still keep the same shape as before, the elastic aspect is still good too. I will never go back to the typical department store brand after trying these."
5.0,Great socks. Wore them with my hiking boots and they kept my feet at perfect temperature the entire time.
5.0,Great
3.0,"I have owned wigwam socks for years and never had any issues. These socks feel great, don't retain odors, stay in place, dry quickly and are extremely durable.
However I am deducting one star because they run large. Had to exchange them for mediums which fit perfectly. These are the only medium size socks I own.
Deducting another star because both my grey and white socks are irreversibly stained by the brown softball infield dirt. No other socks I own get permanently stained.

Wish I had bought medium sized black socks."
5.0,Love these socks! I bought the first pair then bought 5 more pair! They are comfortable all day and they are not too tight around my ankle!
5.0,"love them.... just thick enough  for comfort. I don't run anymore but do a lot of walking and am on the elliptical also. Very comfy, great quality"
5.0,Long lasting wear - great socks!
5.0,Great my wife liked them alot
4.0,"good socks, my feet are happy"
2.0,I remember when Wigwam was a great quality sock.  The quality is so-so.  But the most annoying thing was that they don't carry the logo in the same spot of each foot.  It is on the inside arch of one foot and on the outside of the other foot.  Too cheap to make them properly?
5.0,These are great socks. I have been wearing this model for 6 years this is about my 3rd pair. I like wearing them with my Chaco Z1s especially in wet sandy conditions. They also make really comfortable running socks.
3.0,Fair Product - Would not buy again - Not worth $10 a pair.
2.0,sock was not as seen on internet
3.0,They fit an extra large foot but after first wear there was a lot of pilling. Did not expect that on an $11 pair of socks.
5.0,"BEST SOCKS,  EVERYONE NEEDS TO OWN SOCKS FROM WIGWAM!!"
5.0,These are the only socks I get my son.  I can never find his size elsewhere.  Thanks
3.0,"Tend to twist at toe area of foot. Shoe size is a true 15. Socks were advertised to fit. Fairly close but somewhat small. Seems okay quality but pricey for what I consider an ""okay"" sock."
5.0,"Excellent socks!  They fit great, they are durable (yet comfortable), they are lightweight (so they don't get too warm in the summer), and they wash/dry well (hold their comfort/shape/stretchiness).  I use them for work, for exercising, and for yard/garden work."
4.0,"I didn't realize that this was only one pair. I purchased 3 pairs of wigwam work socks for around the same price as this one pair of socks. My fault for not paying more attention, but the price seems a little high."
5.0,"fits well, washes and dries well.  look good"
5.0,Great quality product
3.0,"The socks fit as expected, but the elastic around the ankle isn't as sturdy as other socks I have.  It seems like it will stretch out and lose it's elasticity soon.  We'll see."
5.0,"Nice, cushiony half socks."
5.0,My mom loves to wear these socks with her Dansko clogs.  She is a nurse and spends a lot of hours on her feet.  These socks keep her feet cool and dry and they fit perfectly inside of her Danskos.
5.0,Socks are durable and soft!  Value is decent compared to other socks of this quality.
2.0,Have worn Wigwam socks prior to these and the quality seemed much better than the ones I recently purchased.  The sock are already beading after only a few washes.
4.0,Kind of $$$$ but nice socks
4.0,"I wear 7.5M women's shoes.  These are a fine fit but I think I could have worn the Small ones easily.  These fit my husband, too, and he wears a Men's 8.5 or 9W to give you a point of reference.  I am hoping these wear as well as the pair I bought a few years ago.  They were far superior in durability to the Smartwool socks I have had.  I decided not to return the M for a S since they are not too bulky in my hiking shoes."
5.0,Nice fit without invasive seams. Will get more in the future
1.0,They are advertised to prevent blisters. I had a bleeding blister halfway through my 1st 5 mile walk.
5.0,I bought 24 pair of these when I joined the Peace Corps. I was  impressed by the quality and have been wearing them ever since.
5.0,Great product from a great American company.
5.0,Very high quality.  Have bought before and they last for 2+ years.  Worth the price.  Very comfortable.
5.0,so comfy
5.0,a little expensive but a nice quality sock.
1.0,No star if possible. Poor quality. A real waste of money.
4.0,fit as expected
5.0,"thanks
very good material"
5.0,"These were probably the most costly socks I've ever purchased, but after buying an expensive pair of hiking boots at REI, I needed a thicker sock that came further up the ankle than I usually wore, so I purchased 3 pair of Wigwam socks - that was 4.5 years ago, and they have been worn and laundered weekly every since. They haven't even started to wear out yet. They don't bind or slide down and offer a sufficient amount of warmth and padding whether I'm wearing light weight walking shoes or the sturdier hiking boots. It was money well spent, and when these finally wear out I will replace them with the same brand !"
5.0,Great sock!
4.0,"I like it, but the last set I got turned somewhat off-color after a lot of washings.  But I love being able to get XL fit."
5.0,"Very comfortable, and they wick pretty well."
5.0,Awesome socks!
5.0,Great job
4.0,looking good!
5.0,Made the 5 days at Disney somewhat tolerable.
4.0,We have very warm summers here in Chico and these socks are the coolest I've found to wear with my tennies.  They also keep my feet cooler during workouts at the gym.  My only complaint is that they are a little small and tight for size 13-15.
3.0,"I wear a 9 1/2 shoe.  These socks are very long.  They must be 2"" longer than anything I have."
5.0,My husband likes these a lot.
5.0,"I've been using these socks for about a month -- they are very comfortable and keep my feet cool and dry. I like the fit and feel, will be purchasing a few more pairs. They are a bit expensive, however, appear to be holding up well after a month of use and washing."
5.0,These socks fit well and feel good on my feet. I wouldn't know i had them on
5.0,Best socks for anything from running to hiking to just lounging.
3.0,The sock is ok. Turned inside out there was a lot of excess threads where 2 halves meet and at logo. I would think for the price they would have better quality control. I have worn them on a few bike rides and they work.
5.0,Most socks are too large or too small and uncomfortable.  Wigwam fits as I was hoping the would and feel great on my feet.
4.0,Gift
4.0,"You can't go wrong with Wigwam socks. They are always worth the price. I'm happy with my purchase, believe me."
5.0,The size was what I needed. Wore them straight out of the box on a 6 mile mountain hike and they kept my feet comfortable and cool. Time will tell on how long they wear. Have always been disappointed with smartwool wearing very good. But I guess these are not wool. Like them so far.
3.0,"My shopping search was for ""THIN"" socks. I know better than to search for uncushioned, because then I only get cushioned socks in the search results.

Granted, the cushioning of these socks is minimal, so I decided to try them for my normal activities. Prior to the first wash, are a bit long in the foot for me, but I use Wigwam Ironman Triathalon socks in the same size and they are absolutely wonderful, in my opinion. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find them in the XL size in BLACK, like I can in white. When these socks popped up in my search for THIN black socks, I failed to read the entire description where it mentioned cushioned soles, so I took for granted they were thin. Alas, there are cushioned, so I had to make a decision.

I plan to give these socks a try, simply because uncushioned socks are nearly impossible to find, except for the very pricey high level athletic socks that crush my feet, or the long legged dress socks that cut off my circulation below my shins. I'm becoming desperate, so I'm willing to try anything, but I don't think these will do very much better than my previous experiences with cushioned socks.

In new form, the cushion lumpiness is bothersome... but maybe subsequent washings will remedy that. No threats of blisters, yet, but I haven't tried them in all of my normal shoes that I wear daily. They are warmer, but I have more problems with sweaty feet than cold feet, so that's no benefit, so far.

If these become the socks of my dreams, I'll amend this review and buy more socks, but if I can find the black Ironman Trialthalon socks in XL size, these will live with the other twenty-odd pair of cushioned socks in my ""backup"" sock drawer. There's only five pair in my daily wear drawer, unless I want to wear white... and it's neither Easter, nor Memorial Day... yet."
5.0,"Very comfortable and cushioned enough for a smooth walking.
The ankle cut makes them ideal for day to day use."
5.0,"These socks are comfortable, they're soft, light weight, and the elastic doesn't slip around the ankles. I enjoy wearing them and look forward to putting them on. I can't think of anything wrong with these socks at this time. If they're as exceptional six months from now or not, I'll post it on another review."
5.0,"I run a lot and have found these to be very effective socks, durable and long lasting. The quarter sock prevents rubbing around your ankles after long runs when footie socks tend to work there way a little down into the shoe."
5.0,A+ these are great all around socks for everyday wear. Excellent quality. A cinch to wash and they last forever.
5.0,Many socks claim to be XL but this pair truly fits the boy's size 14s.  He has had this brand before and likes them.  Very active sports fellow. I am pleased by how they have lasted over the past 14 mos.
5.0,"I wanted some gray socks to wear with my shoes, but I could not find any in town. I'm glad I found these Wigwam Men's Cool-Lite Pro Quarter Length Socks. They not only cushion my foot, but they wick away the sweat too. I like the way the hug my foot. The socks are not tight, but they are stitched so that they are very form fitting which makes them very comfortable.

I just wish the price would be a little cheaper if we buy 3 or 6+ pairs."
1.0,"I wasn't aware that it was only one pair of socks.
I'm not sure why I didn't notice that.  Beyond that...
when they are new they are so soft and nice
feeling but after one wash your holding a pair of
socks that you could have bought in a pack of 6 at
walmart for $5.  Sned it back?  They didn't put a
reciept in the box...  I also thought it was an extra
pair they put in to try.  never could imagine that
one pair of socks would cost $10... but for them to
be such poor quality?  It must makes Amazon look
Bad.  They should think about taking it OFF the list."
5.0,"Great quality weave. Great fit. They seem like they will be very durable and great year round, even with sandals."
5.0,"I've been wearing these Wigwam socks for years and I own multiple pairs from many generations.  This generation the socks are larger than before.  This doesn't bother me but it should be noted.  As for performance, I'm an avid hiker and have never had a problem walking in excess of 12 miles in desert climates with these socks.  Bottom line:  They still look and feel great."
5.0,"The only socks I wear for everyday.  They are comfy, long-lasting, not too thick or too thin.  I will buy more in the future."
5.0,"These socks are the most comfortable socks I have ever wore!! I thought I get get more than 1 pair for the price but after wearing them , they are well worth the price! Very, Very comfortable."
5.0,"I love these socks...they wear very well (I am still wearing the 1st pair I bought 2 1/2 years ago), breath as needed for running, and feel great. What more can you ask from a pair of socks? I run about 20 miles per week and have tried pretty much all of the major brands and I can honestly tell you that these are truly among the best.
There are a couple of other brands that feel and wear equally well as these Wigwams, but they will cost you anywhere from $3 to $10 per pair more. I highly recommend these for any avid runner - in fact I just ordered myself some more!"
5.0,"I love socks. These socks are comfortable, they the moisture away from the foot, and no foot odor. I wore them for 16 hours and my feet didn't smell, I was amazed!"
5.0,It's hard to find xl socks that are made of anything but cotton.  It is more money than I wanted to spend but I do like them and if the continue go perform well I intend to purchase more.
4.0,"Thick sock, right size, comfortable, expensive but worth the price, can wear with work boots, more of a winter sock but wore them during summer"
5.0,"Very expensive socks but seem to be worth the price if they hold up. Good quality, great fit with sneakers. ."
4.0,Nice sock and cool as it says. For some reason I thought this was a set of socks so I was surprised when I received just one. Will be reading more closely in the future for sure. Nice Product.
5.0,"I bought these socks to use with wading sandals while fishing in mountain streams on a trip a few weeks ago. I wanted some cushioning, and most of all fast drying as I was in and out of (cold) streams. These socks were everything I wanted and more. They dried fast, and still kept my feet warm as they dried (inside Keen wading sandals). I have been wearing them in everyday shoes since, and I love them. They wick away moisture quickly, and my feet stay very comfortable. These are 1/4 length socks. I will buy more in full length for colder weather."
1.0,"The socks I received look nothing like the ad for gray
wigwams. Mine are white with a ""spattering"" of gray around the ankles and sole. There is no Wigwam logo, just a red M or W on back of heel. Lesson learned."
3.0,These socks fit well and look good. However the toes and heals do not seem to be reinforced causing them to wear out prematurely.
5.0,"I originally bought these because I wanted a pair of comfortable socks and needed a cheap item to push me over the $25 free shipping threshold. Well, I liked these so much that I bought ten more pairs. Very comfy, and they're perfect for walking, working out, hiking, or just sitting around the house. Highly recommended."
4.0,"I bought this sock along with several others when I wanted to figure out the best socks to use for running in the summer.  It is really hard to judge socks without wearing them for a long long time to see how they wear.  So far I have used these socks several times, and they are fine.  I do not have any serious issues with them.  I do feel a little bit that they might be a too thick because my shoes always feel tighter when I wear these, but they are comfortable.

I like wigwam as a brand because they had a manufacturing facility in the city where I grew up and my mom used to work there.  They always had quality products in my history with using them.  These are my first running socks from them and the quality still seems pretty good.  However, I have to admit that I liked both the Thorlo unisex Experia CoolMax Micro sock and the Balega Enduro Quarter lengh socks even better.  The Thorlo are now my go to running sock.  The Balegas are also very good and cost less."
5.0,"These are expensive and I believe you get what you pay for. They fit perfectly and slide into work shoes with ease. They don't get hot or sticky like cotton socks, wool and don't stink like some poly socks. The seamless toes are nice and the sock is contoured to the curves of your foot without putting pressure anywhere. They glide on the heel and prevent hot spots and blisters. Made in the USA and the stitches were perfect. Good attention to detail. Ordered more pairs after the first one worked out. I will check in once they have a few months of daily industrial use."
3.0,"I was interested to see why people would spend so much on a single pair of socks; since I love other Wigwams that I've owned for years, I gave these a try.  They're great.  But they're not worth the price.  I'm glad I only bought 1 pair.  I'm much happier with the value of ""Hanes Men's 4-Pack Comfort Cool Ankle Socks"", which feel the same to me as these Wigwams."
1.0,The product offer is misleading.  I ordered 2 packs of 3 pair and only got 2 pair of sox.  What a rip-off.
5.0,I buy men's clothes sometimes because they are more durable and practical. This is my first pair of not-Walmart package of socks and they are extremely comfortable and it looks like they will last a long time!
3.0,"I should have my head examined for spending this much on one pair.  It is good quality, But I've found ""good quality"" for a lot less."
4.0,"I recently bought 5 new pairs of socks, all of them different styles and brands.  For the past few years I've been wearing Thorlos thick cushion running socks which to date are the best socks I've ever worn.  However, they are pricey.  Only a few dollars more than what I paid for these socks, but when buying 10 pairs at a time, a few dollars per pair can make a big difference.

I would say that these socks are superior to your average Hanes and Fruit of the Loom socks, but not ton much better.  They breathe, feel quite nice against the skin, and seem very durable.  But I don't think they're worth $10 per pair.  Maybe $5 per pair, $6 maximum.  They lack the cushioning that I desire and are a tad bit too big.

Overall, I think you're paying for the name on the sock than the sock itself.  If you find them on sale, I recommend these socks, otherwise, I suggest you fork over a few more dollars and go with Thorlos."
2.0,To me this is Not what it claims to be. Diffidently not a size 12-15 too small too flimsy save your money
5.0,"I've never been able to tell a difference in any sock, until I purchased these. Very comfortable and seems like my feet get more ventilation. I really like these socks."
5.0,"Best socks hands down. I kept the original box and recites thinking I would be sending them back after wearing for awhile. They boast a great warranty and I believe they stand behind it. I've been wearing Wigwam socks for over a year now and they haven't wore out yet. I just threw away the recite and warranty, and fixing. To order another 5 pair for work this summer. GREAT SOCKS!!!!! What more can I say!!!!"
5.0,"It dawned on me just how much my feet were hurting after workouts because I did not have snug fitting socks.  Whatever brand I'd buy, they'd either be too tight, or worse, slosh around in my shoes.  So I ordered several different brands and sizes of sock from Amazon (after searching hopelessly in department stores and the like).  After some testing, I settled on Wigwam Cool-Lite socks (grey, dark grey and white).  Medium fit my feet perfectly (Men 8.5E).

There was a little bit of shrinking in the washer/dryer, but that stopped after a couple of washings; they still fit nicely... but if you are borderline on the sizing, consider going to the next size larger."
5.0,"Was looking for durable, sweat-wicking socks. It's been several months and thus far these socks have been outstanding. They've maintained their softness and since I use these for running and have given them a thorough pounding, they've show no signs of physical wear or give, though since you are supposed to wash them inside-out, they may not appear brand new. They are easily the best socks I've ever had, bar none, would highly recommend."
5.0,"I wish more stores would carry these socks.  REI used to but they don't any more (at least in our store, and we can't order them).  They are thin on the top and have extra padding underneath, right where you need it.  They also have a higher cuff than many running/sport socks, so they stay up and don't crunch under your heel.  Hope WigWam continues to produce them!"
5.0,"Great socks, these feel great on my feet, warm but breathable, replaced these socks for all my dress socks. bye"
5.0,"good comfortable socks. can't beat it! like butta! and no sock boogers! try 'em, you'll like 'em. good price, as well."
5.0,These socks are as good as advertised!  They keep my feet dry and at a comfortable temperature.  Great cushioning for a sock too.  I would totally recommend these to a friend!
5.0,"This is the best pair of socks that I've worn.  In hot weather, it stays cool and dry. I also love the look and feel of them."
4.0,Just right! Very lite-weight and seem well made(not as good as the older version) They might seem small when you first get them but they stretch so there is no extra material in your shoes/boots to cause blisters!
5.0,"When you're serious about working out - walking or running - your feet have to be treated the best you know how.  Now that my feet are 'getting older' these perfectly-manufactured socks really fit the bill.  The reviews were right - perfect workmanship, perfect comfort."
5.0,I have been wearing Wigwam socks for a few years. As and outdoors man these socks are very comfortable and keep my feet warm and dry.
5.0,"These socks are well padded in the sole and very comfortable!  Good to wear around the house.  In cold weather they keep your feet warm when in house, and keep feet warm when worn outside.  Have not worn them in warm weather yet."
5.0,"I find this pair of socks very comfortable to wear. I bought these socks for summer wear with their wicking ability but have made them my everyday use socks. Of course in the future I will find out how long they will last and also how well they wick the moisture away from my skin but as of now I am happy with this Wigwam Men's Cool-lite Pro Quarter Length Socks. This review is for the White, Large as I bought three pairs each of both the white and grey colors. This would be the same rating review I would give the grey colored Wigwam men's socks as well."
5.0,love my vans. always have.
5.0,My 15yr. old son was happy with them they are true to size
4.0,they're vans need i say more
3.0,Excellent
5.0,At first seemed a little small but got  comfortable with them.
5.0,Love my shoes and they came on time 
5.0,Love em
5.0,"F$$king dope!!! I little tight in the toe area, but I still love them."
3.0,"Good price, good product. Howver, it is generic and if you really need orthotics, best to have them individually fitted. These are a good value."
5.0,"My husband rates these insoles a 5 for comfort. He hasn't noticed any improvment as far as leg or foot pain and has wore them consistantly since Christmas. The owner of the Red Wing store where we get his work boots highly recommended them and he was right. They make heavy, steel toed work boots more bearable. Can't say they will cure or even help with orthopedic problems though. Guess you need to see a doctor for that and not expect a $50 miracle? If they last a year (I'm sure they will) they are worth the money to my husband just for the comfort."
5.0,I have worn the Powerstep Pinnacle shoe insoles for the past 5 years and love them.  They are so comfortable and since I have been wearing them have had no foot pain or other discomfort.
1.0,Very uncomfortable feel like I wasted my money!
5.0,work perfect
4.0,"Comfortable, easy to ""install"" and I love that these come in ""sizes"" to match the shoe size, no trimming and misalignment. They've held up well and I'm running around a hospital all day."
5.0,"I didn't have to cut anything, they fit my shoe perfectly. I wore them in two races within 2 weeks and they saved my life."
5.0,"Excellent product! Would highly recommend to anyone having foot pain, or aching feet!!"
4.0,"This seems to be providing decent relief.  In the morning when I put on the shoes with these inserts, I feel a noticeable relief for my plantar fasciitis.  But they are not resolving my problem."
5.0,This is my second pair of these inserts. The first lasted a good year. The most confidante inserts you'll ever find
5.0,True to size. Great arch and heel support.
5.0,Second pair of Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles purchased.  Bought to replace a pair I have used daily for more than three years.  Doctor had prescribed for plantar fasciitis problem.  They worked.  No recurrence of problem.  Insoles slipped in and out of shoes easily and were comfortable.  Replacement only because the edges were a little frayed.  They are comfortable and require almost no care.  Have recommended them to friends and family.  The price through Amazon was a big plus and was 40% less than price at medical supply store.
4.0,"I would give a 5 star but the top of these insoles are starting to become destroyed. My son is 17 and was telling me how bad his feet hurt. He was told he had planterfacitious. These have take care of his foot pain.

Hoping they last at least 6 months to a year before I have to replace them!"
5.0,I really like these full sole  /  arch support.  With good supportive shoes and these supports I feel very comfortable on my feet for a long period of time...
5.0,They work for me.
5.0,It's great and comfortable
5.0,Perfect for my tired feet.  Great arch support and heel cushion.  Plantar relief is awesome.
5.0,This product is helpful and I love it.  This is my second pair.
1.0,Arch is to high makes my feet hurt.
5.0,My go-to inserts. Many pairs later I'm still a consumer. I've seen others and been suggested others but once you've found something that works it's hard to go with something else. I work as a retail meat cutter for 8-12 hours at a time. Periods of standing in place interspersed with lots of walking. The inserts work great for either level of activity. I have these in all of my shoes and boots.
4.0,"Very good insoles, great arch support but very stiff. I couldn't use them in the shoes I bought them for because the shoes are very soft leather and I know from past experience that stiff insoles will damage soft leather shoes but I had another pair of shoes I could use them in."
5.0,"I bought these to help with my plantar fasciitis. The pain went away the minute I put them in my shoes. Only downfall is they suggest you remove the existing insoles in your shoes. The majority of my shoes have glued down insoles, so it's not always possible. Those shoes feel a little tighter on the top of my feet now, but still worth it. These insoles are amazing! I just wish I didn't put off buying them and bought them sooner! When I get home from work I put them in my slippers and wear them around the house. Pain free day!"
5.0,"I ordered the 7.5-8 and it fit perfectly in 3 of my jogging shoes. No cutting and no fuss, just insert into the shoe and go (aside from getting used to them).If you have pain on the bottom of you feet and/or your ankle, I highly recommend getting these because they are worth it. I could not be happier with these because they took my pain away. I am so grateful to those who commented on these and got me to buy them. Thank you and Powerstep for saving my feet and taking my pain away."
5.0,"Anytime I buy something, I always read the reviews before purchasing the item and this was no exception. I already had pain in my feet from Plantar Fasciitis, so it was difficult to not want to throw them back in the box and send back. If it wasn't for the reviews and giving them a chance because of them, I would have sent them back immediately. Instead I chose to listen and gave them time, even with the pain they caused until my feet got used to them. It took about or less then a week and I was pain free. I cannot stress how difficult it was for me to walk and now I have no pain. I can now stand all day at work and not have to cringe every time I walk."
5.0,Bought a pair for my husband and he loves them. Stopped his knee pain
5.0,"Awesome, bought 2 more."
5.0,The best insoles for me
5.0,These are great for high arches and sever plantar fasciitis.
5.0,"Love these inserts, they are great. Helped with my feet within a few days of using them!"
5.0,Best pair of insoles i've gotten in a long time.
5.0,"Since I got my first pair ,the bottoms of my feet are pain free"
1.0,"These insoles are garbage. They provide zero support and zero cushion. Im very confused as to how it got great reviews from some people. Wore them for a few hours and they already were curling, fading, and tears around the edges. Dont waste your money"
5.0,Suggested by my ortho doc. Very good fit.
5.0,no problems
5.0,Best innersoles I've tried.
1.0,"This item can NOT return. What does the FREE RETURN mean?  Definitely, the price is too high and it is a trick by listing free return under its review counts."
5.0,Fits great with amazing arch support for my flat feet and plantar fasciitis condition. I actually gave them to my mom who has tibial tendonitis/flat feet so I will most likely buy more
5.0,Great but only for those shoes which is half number bigger. Still like it
5.0,Great product.
4.0,"These were recommended by my physical therapist, and they feel great. Only problem is that they run big. I wear a size 8 shoe, but the 8-81/2 was too big. Had to return and get 7-71/2. Otherwise, recommended."
5.0,Great support for my plantar fasciitis. Really makes wearing shoes more comfortable.
5.0,Don't go anywhere without these in my athletic shoes.  Best support for my arch.
2.0,"They fit my foot as expected, but then none of my shoes fit anymore.  I went looking for a new pair of shoes that I could wear them in.  I usually wear an 8 or 81/2.  I ended up getting a 10 and they still pinched on the sides."
3.0,Gives me friction burns in the toe area if I run or walk long distances. Perfect for knee and arch support. Excellent at alleviating plantar faciitis pain! Just wish the toe area wasn't so hard. I have to alternate days with these insoles when running long distances.
5.0,"i have plantar facitis and severe tendenitits, these insoles were recommended to me , and yes , best recommendation! they really do help !"
5.0,as expected..
5.0,"The reviews are accurate! Look up Seattle Foot and Ankle Clinic if you are having feet probs... even if you don't live near the area and won't be a patient there, their website is full of amazing information.  That is where I originally learned of this product!"
5.0,Great!
5.0,Pain In feet has disappeared!
5.0,"Outlasted any insoles I've ever used, and even when they were beyond the life expectancy they kept the core shape and support. I work 12 hour days on concrete and they live in steel toe leather. Pretty much a death wish for any feet comfort situation, but out of all the insoles I've tried and tossed these still come with me in my hardest working shoes."
5.0,I buy these every 6-9 months. These are the best inserts I've used to date that help with the pain. They do not last as long as the original ones I use to get years ago but still get the job done.
5.0,THESE ARE GREAT. They saved my life. I got nice Columbia waterproof hiking boots for a vacation -- but they had absoutely no arch support! I swapped out the insoles for these babies and they carried me all around Norway. I wish all my shoes had removable insoles so that I could put these in them.
5.0,"So I have extremely high arches and I also have runners knee. I overpronate too. I bought brooks sneakers and my runners knee pain almost fully stopped immediately but I still had some issues with stiffness, discomfort and cracking in my knees. I was feeling like if I had extra arch support that would help. So I looked around and found these and since they help with pronation as well I decided to try them. They took some time to get used to. They have a harder shell under the arch and heel. I could feel them under my arches which surprised me as nothing is ever high enough to fill in all the negative space between my arch and the shoe. At first I wished it was softer because I was nervous my arches would get sore from the hard shell. I was pleasantly surprised that after the first use I had zero cracking or tension in my knees. I took them out for an hour because I was bothered by the arch support a bit and felt a little sore but almost immediately my knee started cracking again. So I put them back in and it stopped. By the end of the first day my arches had gotten used to the feeling and I was really happy and I have been using them everyday since. The combination of the brooks sneakers and the pinnacle breeze insoles have alleviated all of my runners knee symptoms. I have ordered a second pair to keep in my other shoes. I bought the 9-9.5 women's and they fit perfectly in my shoes. Very satisfied and highly recommend for very high arches"
5.0,"10-10.5 size fit perfectly in my size 11 shoes after removing the stock insoles.  I guess that makes them slightly large, but worked great for me.  Good stiff orthopedic inserts."
5.0,Great support in my Gavity Defyers and Sketchers shoes and boots. Not a crappy shoddy product.
5.0,They work great.
4.0,Works good enuf
4.0,The inserts fit snug and feel decent.
5.0,Fit great. Very comfortable.
3.0,Unfortunately we threw away the packaging but this product fit too small and hurts the arch of my foot. Not much padding at all... very hard.
5.0,I had ankle pain daily for about 16 years after a severe sprain in my ankle. My doctor recommended the power step plus insoles (red ones). after wearing them less than a week my ankle pain was virtually gone. I switched to these after a few months because they were a lower-cost and also the additional bump in the red insoles was a little uncomfortable at times and my ankle pain has not returned after over a year. I have now bought a pair of these or the red Pinnacle plus insoles for all of my shoes and work boots.
4.0,I've warn them for two days and they work as described so far.
5.0,"These are excellent insoles. They totally changed the way my foot problems affected my walking, sleeping in, etc. my shoes are very comfortable with these insoles inside.  Following the advice of my orthopedic surgeon, I was fitted for and purchased the $400 insoles from an orthotic. WHAT A WASTE.  I use the insoles from Amazon every day. The expensive ones are ????"
5.0,"Great insoles.  I have them in everything, sneakers, dress shoes and even hiking boots as well!"
5.0,These are great insoles I have them in all my shoes and boots.
5.0,This fixed my plantar fasciitis!!
5.0,GREAT!
4.0,helps keep my arches up so my feet don't hurt. So I guess it works.
5.0,Recommended to me by Podiatrist and they are great.
5.0,Great product.
5.0,"This is a routine purchase for my husband for every pair of shoes he gets. He was originally fit with these at the New Balance store. Allows him to be on this feet for longer periods of time and enjoy places that require long periods of walking, such as boat shows, amusement parks, museums, etc."
4.0,I like how it fits into my shoes.
5.0,"On my feet all day and I have high arches :( i buy new shoes take out the insoles and put these in . Worn them for years ! The hard arch does not break down ! I only replace when the blue material over them starts to break down . About 11 months . This has saved my so much money threw the years ! They wanted to do surgery but after 1 month of wearing them my feet were better .
I had tried doctor schols once ... these do not even compare !"
1.0,Changed my gait.  Hip started to hurt.  Doctor said not to use.
3.0,These where the nicest insoles I've tried in a long time and I've been wearing insoles for 30+ years. The only problem is they wore out in about 3 months. At 35.00 a pair that gets a bit expensive.
1.0,"Tried in a few different pairs of shoes, product actually caused me more pain.  I was able to reduce additional pain by removing the insoles.  Did not work for me."
5.0,"Very comfortable and well padded.  Only problem, too big for my shoes and boots.  Fit nicely in my sneakers."
5.0,"AWESOME PRODUCT, FANTASTIC PRICE !!!"
5.0,These were very comfortable and made a difference on my feet
5.0,"This is a pretty sweet product. I use these now when I referee soccer matches. I used to have pretty bad planters fasciitis after reffing 3-4 soccer matches in one day, but now I can run around all day long and feel pretty fresh afterwards!"
4.0,"This product is absolutely wonderful. I purchased the Pinnacle Breeze, and I can DEFINITELY feel a difference. This not only helps with my feet, but also my back. I suffer from lower back problems and every single day I would be in pain. I used these insoles today for the first time and not once have I felt pain in my lower back. It is absolutely wonderful! The only issue is that it's not very comfortable to stand with them on, so if you have a job where you sand all day, I wouldn't recommend these. These don't have any memory foam, they are mostly firm to help with arch support. Other than that, they're perfect."
5.0,The  fit size 9 men's shoes perfect. Great arch support and comfortable all day.
5.0,I have worn these inserts for years.  I have them in every pair of shoes I wear.  They make all my shoes more comfortable and fit better.  Would not go a day without them!
5.0,Great
5.0,Came in a timely manner. Fit great!
5.0,Feels really good on my feet and has helped with back pain.
5.0,"Third pair and I will definitely buy more. Great for tennis shoes, hiking shoes, and casual shoes. Provides sufficient arch and ball of toe support."
3.0,Product was almost identical to the shoe liner that came in my shoe. Wasn't impressed for the money.
5.0,"Husband has pronation and these really make a difference. Without when he works long days he gets tired sore legs, with these there are no more complaints.
For the price its worth a shot.
The feel like quality too."
5.0,"These beat any other insole I have tried hands down and I have probably tried them all.  I have plantar fasciitis and while these are by no means a cure, they help tremendously."
4.0,Seems to be working just as everything I read about them. Still to early for a 5 star
3.0,So far so good. My foot is starting to feel better and they support well. They fit much better if you remove the shoe insole. I'm going to wait a while to see how they wear and if they are doing good I'll buy another pair.
3.0,Kind of hard. Not comfortable at all.
4.0,Great product
5.0,"This one has padding (and can fill up a snug shoe). I am happy to wear 'em without the padding too. I have worn Powersteps for 20 years or so. Curing my plantar fasciitiis, I never took them off. I walk and run in all the time. They are great."
4.0,"They fit perfectly without modification. They may better than most original inserts, but I usually wear a hole in them or before the shoes give out. Ball and heel of foot insert could be more durable."
5.0,Working in steel toe boots for 12 hours a day led to serious pain in the arch of my foot right along the tendon for my big toe. The first steps I took after even 15 minutes of sitting were just brutal. Tried pain relief insoles from Dr. S and had no relief. These had good reviews so I gave them a try and after a full week of use I feel no pain when I walk. I put them in my boots and bought another pair to put in my tennis shoes. I highly recommend these to everyone with plantar fasciitis or arch pain.
5.0,nice item works good.
5.0,"It fits perfect , I have plantar fasciitis and this has been the best insole I have ever bought, I really recommend it , quality is extraordinary."
4.0,"3rd pair Ive bought for my wife. She seems to think they're great ,shes happy, Im happy."
5.0,My second pair.  They are great.
5.0,thy work and at a good price.
5.0,Makes my feet feel good.
5.0,"Love these ! Used to use suoerfeet and switched to this brand , they're half the price. I have a couple of these for my work shoes , Im on my feet all day and need arch support."
5.0,The fit my running shoes well.  Somewhat neutral to high arch fits my feet well
1.0,The first day I wore the product it did what it what supposed to do but after the first day it's like it wore out and just aches the bottom of my feet.
2.0,This insole has a very wide heel-cup that will not fit properly into my Asics running shoes. It did fit my dress shoes without a problem.
5.0,The inserts immediately began relieving the stress-like pain in my son's ankles due to his hyperpronation (ankles turning in). We took him to a specialist who examined these inserts and said they are better than the ones he prescribes! Great product!!
5.0,Could not believe the difference. I had shoes that were painful to wear put these in and voila shoes were as comfortable as any I've worn. Just great!!!
4.0,They are not good when standing on hard concrete all day.
5.0,These are so comfortable. I broke my leg and ankle years ago and these orthotics provide the support I need to not be in constant pain.
5.0,Very comfortable and supportive.
5.0,Please buy if you are hurting !! .I actually found out about these by the foot dr . Unfortunately they switched companies and I found these on amazon.  My quality of life is better with these insoles .  Do not waste money on anything else!  Shane from Calhoun ga
5.0,Best shoe insole I have ever used! Great support. Longevity. Excellent fit in all of my closed toed shoes. I even use them in my slippers and house shoes.
5.0,They give me the arch support I need and hold my feet in place inside my shoes.
5.0,I stand on my feet for 12 hours a day. These help a lot.
4.0,"Fits my men's size 13 shoes well. Fairly comfortable with good arch support, but I could use a little more forefoot cushion."
3.0,Good
5.0,Arrived in good condition. Product fits well. Better than the insoles that come with the shoes.
5.0,"Husband loves these. His feet have been aching plus his plantar fasciitis has flared up again. After the first night of wearing them to work, he said his feet haven't felt this good in a long time! So, the insoles are obviously doing what they claim and well worth the money spent."
5.0,These insoles saved my feet!  Worth the price and highly recommended.
5.0,"Its been a week. Before, my legs hurt: calf to knee, and especially my knee pit, and my feet and heel were constantly in pain and they were never comfortable. I had my massage therapist working on my legs and feet and we were trying to figure out what made my legs hurt so bad. She suggested finding some good shoe insoles that had good support.
First day, they fit right into my shoes and I didn't have to cut it down to make it fit. I started wearing them to work and left thinking I should have brought a spare pair of shoes in case my feet needed a break (the directions suggested only wearing them 3-4 hours to start with), but I only had the shoes on my feet for the day. I made it through the day and my feet actually felt better already!
Fast forward to now a week of wearing them almost everyday. My leg pain is much better. My knee pit where the muscle/tendon felt like it was pulled tight is gone, the heels and feet are much better as well!
If you haven't tried this insole, and you have feet, heel, and/or leg pain, I would suggest these ones!"
5.0,"The best insoles ever, 15hr shift no biggie..I'm just glad Amazon carries them..."
5.0,Great insoles. Feet don't hurt after 16 hour shifts
5.0,"I  ""had "" planters thanks to these"
4.0,Has helped alleviate my foot pain but they are a little too bulk for majority of my shoes.
5.0,VERY comfortable and STURDY
5.0,Gave instant relief to Plantar Facitis
4.0,My son loves them but they lasted less than 3 months.
5.0,"These are fabulous and I now have 4 pair. Great comfort on my heel spur and good arch support. Immediate relief on my heel. Price is reasonable, too."
5.0,These work great if you have to be on your feet a lot. I had knee and back pain before using them and after just one use my knees and back didn't bother me any more. I'm a believer in this product.
5.0,I have been using these inserts for over 20 years. My experience is that these doctor recommended inserts are the only ones that have totally removed my extreme heal spur pain.  They are worth every penny.
5.0,Recommended to me after a hairline fracture in my foot. Been super helpful on my road to recovery.
1.0,Ordered correct size and they will not fit in my shoes!  Amazon won't take them back--they  have never been used.  They were not cheap.  Very disappointed.
5.0,These are as good as a pair of $80 orthotics I purchased. They make a big difference.
5.0,Comfortable.
5.0,Very Comfortable
5.0,My husband and I both use these.  Helps with pain in my flat feet.  Fits in our shoes well.
5.0,I have used these inserts for years and they are great. Good fit and comfort. Provides great support in all my shoes.
4.0,"Are very comfortable.  Bought uncomfortable work boots and saved them with these insoles, but they did almost cost as much as the boots."
5.0,works as expected
5.0,I've bought A LOT of insoles before but these are one of the few that actually works for me. I have flat feet and stand at least 10 hours a day. So these actually help when I'm at work.
5.0,Greater insole for me. Very supportive and seems durable enough.
5.0,Without these inserts I would be buying custom inserts and spending hundreds of dollars each year. Fantastic product for the aging foot of a walker.
3.0,"These inserts help my high arches, however, I ordered a size 11-11.5 for my size 11 shoes and they are too small."
5.0,they work.
5.0,"I purchased two and they seem to last a while. Fits well, I wear 11.5-12, and no pains from walking long distances."
5.0,My foot doctor suggested I get these.
1.0,"Like walking with a large stone under your foots bridge, makes your sneakers look like a big, fat, overstuffed burrito when donning shoe. I would buy again as a torturing device."
5.0,"Love the powerstep brand and this is the first time I've ordered this particular insole.  I usually order the Maxx, but was looking for a little softer foot pad.  So far so good on these insoles.  I would recommend them to anyone that has plantar fasciitis."
5.0,"these r great
helped with my plantar fasciitis
bought many"
5.0,Helps with hammer toe
5.0,It is supportive.
5.0,Perfect. Ive bought these for all of my shoes.
5.0,Excellent product would recommend.
3.0,Too much support?  The arch went way up into my foot and felt like the middle of my arch was now bearing all of the weight instead of my heel and pads.  Not for me.
4.0,"Size seems spot on, great support, but lacking a little is padding or spring for my taste."
5.0,I have used these for years in my work/walking shoes. I have chronic foot issues and these work (for me) just as well as the podiatrist orthotics that I've tried -and those costs hundreds of dollars!
5.0,Was talked in to trying these and am I glade I did!
5.0,Simply the best.
3.0,"Good, but needs more cushion, and the arch is too stiff. Doesn't quite perfectly contour my foot and feels like I am walking on a bubble in the arch of my foot, which makes me take them out of shoes periodically. The complete opposite of the intent..which I would think they would add comfort and reduce discomfort. hm...  Still shopping around for other options..."
5.0,Recommended by my physician and I would recommend it for anyone with plantar fasciitis.  Its got me walking again
2.0,"The product had a great start. I've bought three pairs hoping for better results each time. Other than the pair that was eaten by a dog, I've found the following issue with the other two pairs:

- The blue fabric rubs off and comes lose after a few months. I've used glue and had to repair it a few times.
- once that blue fabric layer comes off, the hard insert comes lose and it really gets tough to keep repairing
- the fabric holds odors really well, so they stunk and required regular washing. I wasn't expecting them to eat odors, but it was worse than anything else I've had in my shoes."
4.0,"Good product for plantar faciatis but beware of Amazon shakedown pricing. First time I ordered it was $20.00, second time was $25 & now they want $32.00. Ripoff!!!"
4.0,"My foot doctor sold me one, for $40. On Amazon for $21, wish the arch was more rigid, this is simi rigid, but the rigid one just hard plastic with little cover and hurt after the while."
5.0,I ordered these on my podiatrist recommendation. They are so great I ordered another pair!
5.0,They definitely help with heel pain!
1.0,FYI these are not returnable so not worth the gamble.  I was expecting cushioning support.  These are very thin and hard.  Not even close to what I need.  Goodwill bin.
5.0,As described. Good Transaction.
5.0,Perfect fit and comfortable.
5.0,Best shoes insoles I ever had.
1.0,"The insoles seemed well-made and sturdy when inspecting them upon arrival.  I first started wearing them on the 15th of March, 2018, the day they arrived.  Its now the 26th of March, 2018, and the blue portion of the insole on the rear (the part that would be contacting your heal) is pealing up...the item is non-returnable due to the seller.  Therefore, Im left with a pricey pair of useless insoles..."
1.0,Did not fit as expected
5.0,"Great Comfort, $20 cheaper then the local shoe store. Cut-to-Fit, plenty of meat to fit a 13 size shoe, maybe even a 13 1/2.  I wear a Size 12, a bit of trimming and the arch support lined up perfectly."
5.0,Had been using pro inserts purchased from foot doctor before tese. Like these better
5.0,"Great product, right price."
5.0,These inserts are great. They were recommended by the podiatrist and do exactly what they say they do. I need to order a few more pairs
5.0,Have used them for years - they are very good.
5.0,"these are the best insoles. They have a good cushion and are very comfortable. I tried several other cheaper ones, and thats what they were cheap .
my podiatrist recommended these."
4.0,They fit my shoes just like they should. They take a little getting used to but work good.
1.0,These are really stiff and made my feet hurt.  I switched to an insole from a local shoe store and my feet feel much better.  Very disappointed in this product from powerstep
1.0,"I was very disappointed when I got this product. I use it as a replacement for Adidas Ace 15.1 Primknie (prime shoe) insole and it was a total disaster. It was like throwing your money in the garbage.
Anyway, don't use it as a soccer boot insole (!!!)"
5.0,Just what I needed... in fact when I attended my appt at the podiatrist they couldn't believe how I chose these as my inserts because it is the ONLY one they recommend and were impressed I already had them!!  YAY!!! Helping with my ankle tendon issue with having such flat feet.
5.0,Recommended to me by ortho foot surgeon better than $350 custom ones.
4.0,comfortable
5.0,My back pain and heel pain is GONE which is insane after being so miserable for so long! I wear a 8 1/2 -9 shoe so I was very confused on what size to order. I ended up ordering the 8 - 8 1/2 after measuring my actual foot and they are perfect.
4.0,"Nice and insoles, okay shipping time. Might do business with again."
5.0,Comfort and support as Im on my feet all day!
5.0,as described and fast ship
4.0,These are pretty wide and couldn't fit in my shoes but they worked great for my husband.
4.0,"These immediately lessened the plantar fasciitis pain I was experiencing and held up for about 4.5 months of daily use at a job where I'm primarily on my feet 8-10 hrs a day. By about month 4, there was a divot in the insole where the big toe of my right foot had apparently dug through the foam-like base. At the end of 5 months, the material at the top of the heel cup was separating as well.

I've since replaced these with some Superfeet greens which right out of the box seemed to be of higher quality construction (the bottom of the insole from the heel to arch was made of hardened material, whereas these were the same pliable material all the way through). I wouldn't NOT recommend these, but be aware they'll only last about a third of a year. If I remember, I'll try to update with the Superfeet's lifespan."
4.0,I have bought this product for over a decade.  Quality has declined concerning the covering. 2 out of my past 3 models worn holes and the top covering came partially off in a short period of time.  The other has no issues.
5.0,I am a delivery driver so I am on my feet a lot. Put these in my Wolverine boots and my feet have felt great ever since. Provides great arch support.
5.0,These really help my foot pain
4.0,My podiatrist  recommended these insoles.  I am now on my second pair and have been very pleased with them.
5.0,Absolutely love this product I have been wearing them now for over six months and they are still firm/ strong and not worn. I do wear the  insert every day for approx 10-13 hrs. I had plantar fasciitis and  it has reduced my inflammation in my heel.  I highly recommend these inserts.
5.0,best inserts going
5.0,Good price and works well.
5.0,"Excellent insole with good support for my high arches and relief for my bunion!! The Pinnacle Breeze has a sort of waffle texture that does feel cool without rubbing or irritating my skin. Thanks to most of my shoes having removable insoles, and the availability of great insoles with arch support and heel cups I'm able to get additional years out of my shoes. I am often on my feet, and frequently on ladders - these offer the support my feet need to keep going without plantar fascia pain."
2.0,I have used Super feet insoles in the past for several years .  They cost more than I wanted to spend this time around so I decided to try these insoles .  I was very disappointed .  The arch of these is much higher than the Super feet and much stiffer .  In the interim I have also decided to try minimalist running shoes and so won't be using any insoles for now
5.0,"I got this product delivered around mid July 2017, and after 8 months of use, these Insoles are still as comfortable as the first day, there in good shape.

Before buying these, i got the Dr. Scholls 440 at a retail store, at first they felt very comfortable and with good arc support, but just after 3 weeks of use the pain of being standing up for 40+ hours in a warehouse/office working environment came back, so those 40 dollars insoles did not work for me. I then decided to look for a different option, after some Google research and based on reviews at Amazon, keeping in mind that i was looking for a good arc support, i stripped it to 2 brands; Powerstep Pinnacle and Superfeet Black, initially i was slightly inclined to buy Superfeet even the price doubles Powerstep, but there was one review that cached my attention of a customer having the same issue as me, he tried before Dr. Scholls, then changing to Superfeet and he kept experiencing the same foot pain, i decided to give Powerstep a chance and i definitely made the right choice, no more pain. For me, these insoles definitely made me and my feet happy.

I even got my wife a extra pair and her feet keep thanking me. Lol"
1.0,"waste money for nothing, doesn't help your feet at all"
2.0,My wife has tried numerous inserts and these didn't help either. They are very firm and uncomfortable. The search continues.....
5.0,"I am reordering. The fit great and are made of good quality material,. I have been wearing these everyday for the past year. All I hoped for and expected!"
5.0,"Great inserts, both these and the Original insoles are great if you need arch support. I am also a plus size woman so I need something that can handle all the impact my feet can have while walking. These work really well and are very easy to transfer from shoe to shoe (provided you take out the shoe's insole so your feet aren't too snug). I typically buy new inserts every 6 months due to wearing these every day but they last well if you don't do too much walking in your daily life (when I use to be more active I bought Powerstep inserts every 4 months) these are a great price for relief in feet problems."
4.0,"Seems to be very good quality, especially for the price. They don't feel quite as good as some other insoles for my feet, but I'd certainly give these a try."
2.0,Hurt my feet
5.0,Made a big difference when you need to be on your feet a lot.
5.0,I've been using these since I had a plantar fascitis..and they are GREAT
5.0,Has a nice arch support
5.0,These seem to be helping with my Plantar Fascitis
5.0,I have tried many insoles but these feel the best.  I have really high arches and these really help with foot pain.  I will buy these for every shoe I can.
5.0,Adds just the right amount of support for my arches.
5.0,"When I wear these insoles, I cannot be stopped.  Pretty sure they make me invisible too."
5.0,"These are perfect!!
8 hours on my feet, no pain!"
5.0,These provide the extra support I need in my tennis shoes. They fit perfectly and do not make my shoe tight.
5.0,"I am wearing them today for the first time.  Too soon to report.  So far, so good."
5.0,Great product and it fits my shoes every time I buy them! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend or family member.
5.0,Helps with heel pain/fasciitis. Good support. Half the price of stores.
5.0,Replacing existing insoles.
1.0,I have purchased Powersteps in the past. This pair I received had way too much support on right insole. Be careful because they don't accept returns on this item. Turns out I wasted my money. Looks like I'll be going back to Superfeet.
5.0,"Great price, these are selling for 39.00 in stores so a great price!"
3.0,Hard to put in shoes. I wouldn't buy again.
5.0,Very supportive insole ans wear on the shoe
4.0,"These work. I've purchased at least 8 pair over the last 2-3 years and wear them even in my sneakers now. The only challenge is that they do take up a lot of room in my Clark's flats, but they really do make a difference in comfort on days when I'm walking a lot."
2.0,"I have owned two pair. the first pair I got was great and lasted about 6-8 months. I order a second pair here from amazon and after wearing them only 1 month they began to feel weird and might feet began to hurt. So, I took both of them out and notice that the blue lining had becoming completely loose and had peeled up off the sole themselves and the bottom of both soles where the plastic support plate ends had ripped completely in both soles."
5.0,Bought these for my son who is on his feet all day. We both have plantar faciitis & I bought a pair last year & they really helped. His arches are starting to fall & these have a very strong arch to them so I hope they help him as much as they helped me.
1.0,"I purchased these for an extremely bad case of plantar fasciitis, and I've worn them for approximately 5 weeks. They don't fit in all of my shoes because they take up quite a bit of space, but I have two pairs of shoes in which they fit. There has been no improvement in my condition, and in fact it has worsened. I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but I'm disappointed."
5.0,Gives great support. I use them in all of my running shoes.
5.0,Love powerstep! Thank you
5.0,great product
4.0,I feel support when I walk with the insoles.
5.0,Helps a lot with plantar fasciitis. Very supportive. My dad recommended them to me and I have also found them very helpful.
5.0,"Perfect product, perfect customer service."
4.0,"Work OK, my arch is higher than these are apparently for."
5.0,"My foot doc recommended these inserts. I like them because they offer good support for the price. They last a long time if you keep them away from your pets.
The size was perfect."
4.0,"Good arch support, but now my shoes slip on my heel. Still the inserts make them more comfortable."
5.0,"When I received this item. I think that it is too thick. but,  I immediately knew that my thoughts were wrong.
It is very good item for me."
5.0,Very comfortable glad I made the purchase thanks again!
1.0,"Box was in bad condition when it arrived. These hardly fit in my shoe. Seem to be very uncomfortable to the shape of my foot but could be due to the fact that they're too big for my shoe. Tried to return these, says item not eligible for return. I wasted my money."
5.0,"I've been using these for about four years, after my podiatrist diagnosed me with plantar fasciitis. After some judicious stretching and icing, along with the power step inserts, I was able to avoid cortisone therapy or surgery. Everything is back to normal. I am on my feet for the job, 8-12 hours a day and am an avid hiker. Power Step inserts are life savers!"
5.0,"It provides just enough arch support without making my feet turn out and causing
pressure on the outside of my feet."
4.0,"Works as expected. I needed to get the Maxx version because I needed a higher heel and arch support, but these orthotics are good for their intended purpose and they fit my shoes nicely."
5.0,As good for me as expensive custom orthotics I have used. Now have 4 pairs to reduce constant switching between shoes. Highly recommended for plantar fascits and other problems that orthotics address.
5.0,Helps me be able to walk all day. I wear them in all my shoes
5.0,"After just 3 days I can tell a big difference, will be ordering a pair for each pair of shoes."
5.0,"Wear these everyday in my work shoes and they make it possible for me (62yo M, 235#) to finish my day as a Nurse without foot pain. Additional plus- they were $18 less than in local retailer. Now if they could only do something about my back, knees, memory ..."
5.0,"These are doing what they should be doing, I just need a little more support. I do like that I can use in different shoes, makes them very user friendly."
5.0,Best ever.
5.0,Lessen the pain that I am having on the heel of my feet.
5.0,"These fit as expected, also raised my arch up as expected. If you can remove the liner from your shoe before putting these in, it would be helpful because these arch supports add some thickness."
5.0,these were purchase for running shoes. Very comfortable
3.0,"Length-wise this inner soles match the length of my foot. HOWEVER, the inner sole thickness in height makes it nary impossible to put in shoes that already appropriately fit my feet. If you typically buy shoes about a full size too big for your foot these will be great for you (or if you've got shoes you bought too big on purpose to accommodate thick socks/inner soles). But if you are expecting to add this to a shoe that fits perfectly, forget it. Your toes will be so incredibly crushed. Also this insert is quite wide, I have narrow to medium feet and this insert pushed the sides of other shoes outwards. In terms of comfortability, the arch is just slightly aggressive, but pretty comfortable and seems to be quality made from plastic that will not ""fall"". I can only wear these soles in one pair of boots I got as a gift that came too large.

I find that Superfeet makes soles that are far more accommodating for shoes you already have in your closet and fit well, ESPECIALLY their 3/4 dress insert for slightly tighter shoes."
4.0,a little small
3.0,"These insoles are extremely wide. I've put them in a couple pairs of shoes and in both cases, they stretch out the sides of the shoes. I also noticed that my feet still pronate when I walk, so needless to say, these were not the solution for me."
5.0,"This brand is the best, in my humble opinion."
5.0,Nice product and quick delivery
5.0,Fit was perfect
5.0,Relieved pain of plantar fasciitis. Have a pair in every pair of shoes. Fit as advertised. Easy to slide into shoes.
5.0,Great orthotics that provide a firm base for my feet.
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,"I am a 34 year old male, shoe size 9.5-10 US, with relatively high arches. I began experiencing pretty severe plantar fasciitis at the end of last year. I bought several inserts for my work shoes to alleviate this pain. Of all the ones I purchased the Powerstep insert fit my shoes very well and gave me almost instant relief. I bought a second pair so I could put them in another set of shoes (and I've even used these in my soccer cleats). They won't be the best for everyone but if you have plantar fasciitis and high arches you should give them a try!"
4.0,Good support and well made.
2.0,It is as if it is not the real thing and some poor facsimile.
5.0,"Work boots feel like tennis shoes now thanks to powerstep inserts! Highly recommend them to everyone. Wear them for about two or three weeks for short periods of time until you get used to them, and then you will not want to leave home without them!"
5.0,Been using them for years.
4.0,"Not bad, a hair too thick for my Vibram Merrells"
5.0,Exactly what I needed
5.0,The Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles work well by providing good arch support.  They also help with pain in the heel of the foot.
5.0,These are the best insoles for plantar fasciitis.  I have purchased this product 3 times in the last 5 years.  Great product.
5.0,Seem like good insoles.  Really help with my foot pain.
5.0,Wouldn't be without a pair.
5.0,Provides great comfort
5.0,"Just ordered this in hopes that this would help my better half's plantar fasciitis & then I decided I had to try something so I ordered these. Albeit,  they were recently purchased,  they've helped dramatically. Another great help was the really nice  fit which was perfect.  No cutting,  sizing,  just insert & go. I'll update this review if in the next few weeks our opinion of these insoles changes but honestly,  I don't see that happening  Btw, I bought these for a size 10 shoe & as I said prior,  they fit exactly as they should. So happy..."
5.0,I was having increasing heel pain for several months. Bought a new pair of Keens and purchased these inserts and pain has mostly subsided. Orderedtwo more pairs for boots and shoes. So far excellent
3.0,"I bought the wrong size and had to cut them down to size.  I think they do the job, so they're okay."
3.0,These are high-quality effective insoles. They take up a lot of space in your shoes and in my case none of my shoes fit with the insoles inside.
5.0,I spent $400 on custom orthodics and these are better -- $20.  They fit perfectly.  I ordered two more pair for other shoes.
5.0,Good fit
5.0,I love these insoles. I am a nurse and work 12+ hour days on my feet. These insoles are the best I've ever bought and keep my feet feeling great all day.
5.0,These saved my feet from some horrid shoes I ordered. They don't totally make up for bad shoes but they sure make them bearable. I recommend these for any shoes because even the expensive ones have crummy soles a lot of the time.
4.0,
5.0,Awesome. Especially if you have planter facilities!
5.0,Love these since I started using these two years ago my plantar Faciitis has not returned. Love these inserts!!!
5.0,"very comfy,fits my arch perfect. top of foot pain caused by dorsal compression syndrome feeling much better after few days. will buy more for other shoes. how they hold up only time will tell."
5.0,Excellent item really helped with my plantar fasciitis!!!!
5.0,Ive used these for years.  Good support and cushioning.  Will last for a long time before needing to be replaced; not like the real cheap ones.
1.0,i need something to help with the balls of my feet since its been hurting me every time i walk.  i purchased this and was hoping it will help.  of course this was too bulky in my shoes and basically making my feet swell up.  i wanted to return this but was denied. if i had read in their description of not being able to return item i would not have purchased it.  now this is just gonna sit and collect dust in the closet. waste of money.  better off buying from other companies. very disappointed!
1.0,"These were delivered Tuesday of this week. I wore them Wednesday through Friday (3 days) and they are broken down already. These are absolute garbage and NOT for people who work on their feet. You can get better quality for the same price at Wal Mart, no exaggeration. Powerstep can surely go f*** themselves, and I will be telling everyone to stay away if they work on their feet for a living. Would rate 0 stars if it was an option."
5.0,Nicest insoles I've had yet. I walk a lot on concrete factory floor all day and these helped immensely. We'll see how long they last.
1.0,to hard never use them
5.0,works as intended
4.0,It takes time to get used to but it works if you have issues with your feets.
5.0,Took away my lower back pain. Life saver!!!
5.0,these are awesome.  Good support and helps my back
5.0,Purchased after experiencing a lot of pain due to plantar fasciitis. I wish I had know about these 5 years ago! Great product.
4.0,not the most comfortable insoles i have tried but the only ones that have helped my heel pain  from day one pain is gone
5.0,Great product to relieve foot pain due to flat feet
4.0,"Definitely, makes a difference when walking--less foot pain."
4.0,"These inserts work fine, but confirm with more than one professional before you buy ortho inserts.  One podiatrist said I over-pronate and I got these inserts.  My symptoms did not go away and I saw an orthopedic surgeon who said I supinate.  I stopped using this product and followed the latter doctor's advice and my symptoms went away."
1.0,I did not like the quality tried to return bu wasn't able to
4.0,Exactly what I was hoping for.  Bought a pair of these at an orthopedic's office and paid much more for them.  These are the exact same thing at a much better price.  Great if you have foot pain and/or high arch.
5.0,I like the comfort of the insole and it stays in place. I wish I would have read all what each insole has to offer therefore I would have ordered the correct one. I am still happy either the one bought but I will be purchasing  the one I need now that I know they have such a variety..
4.0,Works good price thanks
5.0,Spent $90 on a pair of boots that hurt to wear even after breaking them in. These fixed the problem. No more pain.
5.0,My podiatrist recommended these and then I found them on Amazon cheaper than they sell them at the office. Really helps with my plantar fasciitis would definitely recommend to anyone with sore feet who do a lot of standing or walking as part of their job.
5.0,These were recommended to me by a friend.  I had to go to the foot doctor and he recommended a different brand (twice the price).  But after looking these over the doctor said if I wanted to use these he approved of them.
5.0,Recommended by physical therapist. Work well
4.0,"I bought 3 products to help with horrible plantar pain.  This was the only one that met my expectations.  After one month, I wear them everywhere and plan on buying another pair soon.  I am going to see if they last well for another month before spending more money."
5.0,They were exactly what we expected.
5.0,Good price.
5.0,This is a very satisfying product. Fit is perfect and they are comfortable. Totally ended my brief bout of plantar fasciitis. Will continue wearing them in my athletic shoes for prevention.
4.0,"Good quality, much better than the insoles that came in the shoes.  Will purchase this item in the future."
5.0,very helpful
5.0,"Reduces discomfort from plantar fasciitis.
Perfect fit - did not  have to trim the insert"
1.0,Terrible. Wouldnt recommend you buy. I have tried to put these in multiple shoes and they don't fit. Havent been able to use them at all and they cant be returned.
5.0,Been using theses inserts for 5 or more years . Love them.
5.0,Good orthotic for the price my phi sap therapist recommend. Would buy again.
4.0,Got what I expected. Good price.
5.0,"I felt the different instantly. After breaking my foot, Ive had a hard time finding shoes with support that also cater to all my needs (and wishes). I will say these don't have the same effect in all my shoes, though. Theyre great in my Nikes, but not in all my New Balance shoes. Its weird... Better than a custom orthotic though."
4.0,All good.
5.0,"The Powersteps are well made and provided relief for my plantar fasciitis. They worked so well, I ordered a second pair."
5.0,Really helps
1.0,This insole is really bad and so painful in 3 of the shoes that I tried! I bought another cheaper one from Amazon and it works awesome!! I will not recommend this to anyone!!
1.0,"These do not provide any ""cushion"". They are very stiff and hard like a board. After putting them inside my shoes I can't even get my feet inside the shoe anymore. They might help people who need arch support and no cushion. I immediately tried to return them but Amazon says that this is a ""non-returnable item"". They should have told you that at the time of purchase. Far better to try these at the store and see if they're good for you than buying them through Amazon."
5.0,Good insoles no complaints.
5.0,They fit my friend great!
4.0,Every day. Started to get a bit smelly after 4 months.
5.0,Gives arch support and I like them the best of any brand I've tried.
5.0,Love these inserts.  I am a kindergarten teacher and I am ordering more.
1.0,"I bought these inserts hoping theyd make my shoes more comfortable, but not so much. The arch is so high and they are actually relatively hard vs. cushy like I would expect from an insert. Worst part is, the product says it is eligible for free returns, but in the new version of Amazon it is not eligible for return. Defeats the purpose of shopping on amazon."
4.0,"Totally overpriced, but does the job."
4.0,The fit was good but they still made my daughter's shoes too tight.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Fit perfectly
4.0,Got for my husband and he is happy
5.0,Love these orthotic inserts!  They are a great price and they work well to alleviate my plantar fasciitis.  This is the 4th It 5th pair I have purchased.  They last about a year for me.
1.0,"Not Happy, felt like these were ""Used"" already.  Will not be purchasing these again."
5.0,Third pair and I love them!
5.0,Great support!
4.0,"With plantar fasciitis, its essential to have good support in the arch and heel of the foot.  These inserts give that support, even for a big guy (200+lbs) like me."
5.0,Great product!
5.0,Fit as expected.. Arrived on time.  Thanks
4.0,The size fit perfect for my foot size . More comfortable than expected. Cut my foot pain more then in half from plantar fasciitis
5.0,"Awesome insoles,  like everything about them."
5.0,Great insoles!
5.0,Great arch support
5.0,Treat your feet.
1.0,"This item does not fit like the Protech version. I have worn powerstep Protech insoles for two yesra. They are great. I wanted a spare pair so I didn't have to constantly swap the insoles. I purchased the pinnacle and it does not fit the same. The left insolenis causing pain in my arch and I cannot wear these.  To make matters worse, the company has a no return policy so I'm stuck with these $20 painful inserts.  So disappointing."
5.0,"I have moved this single pair from shoe to shoe for two years. They are looking pretty beat up now, but I have used them to travel Europe, climb around Pompeii, walk in New York City and walk gravel country roads.  My podiatrist ""customized"" one with a custom cut pad to correct a toe problem. I'm buying new ones today, even tho these aren't smelly!

It is very important to choose the correct model and size for your feet. These are not just foot cushions."
1.0,"Believe other reviews!
Prior to these, I have worn Powerstep orthotics, as recommended by my podiatrist, no problem.
These broke down in 16 days. cup for the heel is now protruding and making me sore. While other reviewers might not have needed/understood this device, this is NOT the 'year or so' I expect from Powerstep products. There is NO REASON the cushion material should have broken down in days."
1.0,These have gone downhill drastically. I have worn them for years and now they are terrible. Almost crippled me. DO NOT BUY THESE! Terrible. You can see the difference in production. CHEAP and ununiform. Must be Chinese. I have never bought anything on Amazon that I could not return. BUYER BEWARE You cannot return these to Amazon. Terrible. I don't understand why Amazon doesn't accept return. Its only been a couple days.
3.0,"I have been wearing PowerStep Pinnacle insoles for many years on the advice of my podiatrist because of a bad bout with plantar fasciitis. I was very unhappy with the fact that their quality control had gone downhill and the company would do nothing about it nor would they stand behind their warranty.
When I saw the Vienzone insoles advertised, I decided to give them a try and boy am I happy I did. They are far superior to PowerSteps at about half of the cost and have all the comfort if not more. I will have to wear them and see how they hold up in the long run, but I can say if they only last as long as the PowerSteps, they will be worth the replacement cost. The height and placement of the arch support is perfect for my foot and the 10-10.5 size is perfect with no trimming needed. I bought multiple pairs so I can have them in all my shoes without having to switch."
5.0,Its amazing that something so small can make such a huge difference! I will be buying more of these for sure!!
1.0,I bought it because I have foot pain but this made my foot pain worst and you cannot even return it. This is not as soft and comfortable as Dr. scholl's insoles.
5.0,I stand at work all day and a friend of mine recommended these inserts.  What a pleasant difference.  They just feel nice in your shoes.
5.0,These are the only product that provides proper support and comfort for my plantar faciitis. They hold up remarkable well to daily use. Well worth the cost.
3.0,Wish they were a little less expensive. They need to be replaced after a few months.
2.0,Return it doesn't fix...
5.0,"These insoles are life savers! I tried everything to help my plantar fasciitis, this was the only thing the helped. After wearing these insoles for two months, my plantar fasciitis was gone!"
4.0,So far so good. I've only been wearing them for a short time. I'll post back later.
5.0,The best inserts for relieving my pain.
4.0,"These fit 'true to size' for the length, but they are quite wide. I have discovered that not all of my shoes fit nicely with these inserts also because they are tall. Best to take them on your shoe shopping adventures. They work really well to add support."
2.0,Relieved my Plantar Fascitis for 3 Days. Then the unbearable pain returned in full force. These were recommended by my Podiatrist.
5.0,These are the best for your feet. They have stopped all of my foot pain. I use them in all of my shoes.
5.0,My brother got these for my BF and he loved them! so much so that he asked for another pair when he wore his to death.  Stands up to a lot of use.
5.0,Works great for plantar fasciitis!
1.0,Need to send back as my husband needs arch support as well as softness. Has very bad flat feet
4.0,I like these but they could use a little more padding so I ordered the maxx one as well.
4.0,"If they were a tiny bit softer, they would be perfect."
1.0,"These insoles didn't help at all, barely any cushion, half way through the day the pain in the ball of my foot was intense"
5.0,delivered as promised
1.0,These insoles are to aggressive for my arch. I wore these in my work shoes and by the forth day they would  irritate my feet . These probably would work great if I had planter fasciitis  so I had to remove  these and I'll have Dr. Scholls in my shoes
5.0,a Godsend. Superb
4.0,Pretty good so far.  Heel cup and motion control seems to be excellent.  Arch support feels OK too.  So far they are working well in the shoes I bought them for.
4.0,"So far so good.  Bought these because my parents are avid fans of these.  I have had them in my shoes for about a week now, and they are great.  Time to order another pair!"
5.0,"These have been a life saver. Ive had plantar fasciitis for many years, and cannot even go barefoot in the house. I mainly use these in my house shoes since I found a good pair of shoes for outdoors that are comfortable as is.  Bonus they cost half the price I was paying the shoe store."
5.0,Ordered these on the advice of my podiatrist. I've never has an insert that fit so well. It alleviated the soreness as soon as I put them in my shoes. Will definitely be buying these again.
5.0,Great orthotic for the money.  I have one in all of my athletic shoes.  Cheaper price than retail store.
1.0,Arch support is in the wrong place.  Very uncomfortable
5.0,"I have pain in my hill and my acupuncturist recomend this.
I have been used for three years are the best.
From the beginning my hill pain was resolved.
I recomend it."
1.0,Non-returnable. Too wide for narrow shoes. Too much curve in footed and I have high arch. Buy somewhere else where you can test them with your shoes and feet.
5.0,"Excellent !!!
I was working with a podiatrist and I know how much cost a custom made orthotics $$$
With this insoles problem finally solved. Good quality also. 100% recommended."
5.0,Comfortable and supportive
3.0,"Comfortable and provides support. However, my podiatrist instead recommended the Powerstep Comfortlast for my plantar fascia pain (on both feet).  The comfortlast has more cushioning and is more comfortable, but not as durable.  I switched and after a couple weeks of using the comfortlast, my plantar fascia pain has improved dramatically.  Unlike the other Powersteps, this Pinnacle version is thin enough to fit into my Ecco Dress Shoes. However, I ended up not using them for my dress shoes, and went with a different option.."
4.0,Im liking them a lot!!
5.0,I think these are super-awesome so far.  I don't want to take off my shoes when these are in them.  I will try to remember to update this review if I notice any changes
3.0,Order a half size up.
5.0,"I am on my 5th pair in 5 years and they are awesome. I have issues with a Neuroma in my right foot and got custom 1/2 foot orthotics made for $400 about 7 years ago and these are so much better! They have a lot of cushion and i never feel my neuroma. I wear either a size 12.5 or 13 running shoe and depending on the shoe I can sometimes keep the stock insert in the shoe along with the PS orthotic. If I have to take out the stock shoe insert the orthotics are still very comfortable and provide plenty of cushion. I always keep my eye out for these in case they go on sale so I can buy more. I usually rotate them between shoes, but I am starting to get where I can keep them in different shoes. With heavy use they will last you about a year. Even ones I have had for 3 years I still use in shoes I don't wear very often and they work great."
5.0,Very reasonable price and my feet feel much better!
4.0,I have problems with plantar fasciitis and these orthotic inserts have provided relief when I walk. The pinnacle inserts are nicely cushioned compared to the regular powerstep inserts.
1.0,"Absolute JUNK..
LASTED 4 WEEKS..."
5.0,Fit was fine and much less expensive than my Dr office!
5.0,"I use these with my work boots and they make a huge difference. You can feel the difference when they've flattened out and need changing that's for sure. A year later, just bought new replacements, not going back to some of the other brands I've tried along the way - these fit the bill just right."
5.0,Best insoles I've ever had.
5.0,These orthotics are incredibly comfortable. I now have 2 pairs to move between and among my shoes and boots.
5.0,Noticeable Relief of knee pain within a couple of days! No negatives !
5.0,"These were recommended by my physical therapist and I concur they work well, are comfortable and I plan to purchase more to put in my other shoes. They support my arches which alleviate issues with my knees, hips and lower back. I love them."
4.0,"I like that these are firm fitting,I bought my size but around the front part of them is a little short. I would go up a half size if u can if not a hold size."
2.0,They are way too hard & wide to fit into ANY shoes or boots I own. I returned them and I'm currently looking for something that will actually fit into women's shoes & boots that have a good arch support.
5.0,Seem to be pretty comfortable. Good support.
5.0,"Great insert, live the support!!! This is my second pair."
5.0,"I've been wearing these for years, and they're awesome. I have flat feet and bunions, which cause a lot of pain, and these were recommended to me by my local running store. They provide plenty of cushioning and last a long time. Once I put a pair of these in my shoes, my feet feel much better. They might seem expensive, but they're well worth the cost. They last a long time before completely wearing out, but I like to change them every 8-12 months."
5.0,Purchased as a gift so no personal feedback.
1.0,"Package outside was nice, sealed, and not damaged.  Package inside was ripped open.  Appears I got the one that was previously returned.  Bottom line, the product feels awkward.  Like the arch is highest too far back towards the heal.  Of course I got the one that doesnt have returns!  Not sure how that works, since if I buy it now it says free returns.  Im throwing it away!"
1.0,after wearing for only a few days the top material is rolling up on the heal
5.0,They are great and fit perfectly.
1.0,Poor Quality.  I have used this product for years without a problem.  I recently ordered new ones but the quality is not the same.  The top layer of the insert started to come off after just a few wearings.  Very disappointed.
5.0,"These were recommended by a family member who owns a shoe store.  I could have ordered them from her but it would have taken a week or so, but got these from Amazon rather quickly.  They provide solid support in my work boots and help my feet to not be sore at the end of the day.  I will definitely be ordering again."
5.0,Fit perfectly good arch support
4.0,I got these insoles recently. They fit as expected. They are good. As I just started using these so I didn't want to give 5-star. I can say they are good
1.0,They separated in about a week.
4.0,I was given these to me by my foot doctor. I have had these over a year and enjoy wear my shoes again.
4.0,"These have a high, ball shaped part, for arch support; this is a fraction of an inch too close to the toes. I would prefer it sat down closer to the heal. This is probably because my arches are far back. Other than that (which doesnt really cause problems unless I try to put them in shoes that were already thigh in the toes), they are great and make all my boots so much easier to stand in all day."
5.0,I LOVE these shoe inserts! They're the best for my feet and I was SO happy to find these new ones for HALF of what I usually pay! Thank you for great service.
5.0,I purchased these to update a vintage set of ski boots.  Haven't had a chance to try them outdoors yet but they feel great in the boots. We already know about their quality from previous purchases.
5.0,Helps. And works great
5.0,I put these in almost all of my boots and shoes.  I have a high arch and they are very comfortable.
5.0,Wonderful product and walking has been so much easier.
4.0,"It doesn't agree with all my shoes particularly if the insole is hard to remove. However, for the shoes that the soles do get along with, so to speak, the fit is great and the plantar fasciitis pain has come down considerably. I would buy these again"
5.0,Have used these before from my podiatrist. Was happy to find them here for much cheaper.
5.0,These inserts are perfect. I have a lower back issue and by using these inserts it has definitely helped with the pain
5.0,"I have recommended these to multiple plantar fasciitis/heel spur sufferers since I discovered these.  After countless visits to doctors, therapists and way too much pain from plantar fasciitis and a large heel spur I did my own research and found these gems.  I wear them in slippers as well as shoes for consistent support.  They changed my world 5 years ago when I discovered them.  I went so far as to discuss them with staff at a local running shop before my first purchase.  They are top rate.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics - Great!
I have plantar fascia in both of my feet and I had surgery 6 years ago to remove to benign tumors so I need orthotics to relieve pain and to correct my step from being too flat.  My Orthopedic Doctor recommended orthotics that were 5 times the cost of the powersteps and I can't hardly tell the difference plus the custom orthotics had to be cut to fit my shoes.  The powersteps fit perfectly in my mens size 11.5 shoes.  I like the orthotics I purchased several pair for each of my dress shoes which I wear at work so that I don't have to pull them out each time I change shoes.  I highly recommend this product."
5.0,Fitted as expected. Good product.
5.0,"Work great, feet feel good."
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Happy with purchase
4.0,"These fit well and are fairly good, but still not enough cushion for my heal pain."
5.0,"I have Plantar Fascitis and these insoles worked for me!

My podiatrist suggested that I get orthotics, but of course my insurance company thought it best not to cover the cost from the professionsl.  He recoomended these insoles.

At first, there was a break-in period where my foot had to become familiar with the new insoles.  My shoe also needed some adjustment as this did take up some space and the laces needed to be loosened.  I just re-laced both shoes to accommodate the reduced space in my shoe.

I wore them for a few hours the first day, and over the weekend, I increased the time I wore them until I was comfortable wearing them all day.

Now, after working eight or more hours on my feet, I have no pain.

Very glad I have these.  I have ordered them for three pair of shoes, and rotate them seasonally as needed."
5.0,"Seriously these have made a huge difference in my feet and legs when walking alot or standing alot. I'm using these for everyday use and when walking and jogging,"
5.0,"I have a lot of foot pain for a lot of reasons.  These inserts saved me!  Make sure you take out the original inserts from your shoes before inserting these. If you have a flat arch, they are great.  I tried many, and these are the best so far!"
5.0,got these for my daughter and she loves them
1.0,"The insole is shorter than advertised. Supposed to fit a 10-10.5 womans shoe. My running shoe (Hoka) is a 10.5 and the insert is about a half inch too short. Most inserts need to be trimmed down to size. Not this one. Too short to begin with, causing my toes to slide over the front of insole when walking and makes running very uncomfortable."
4.0,Great product.
4.0,"These orthotic inserts are very good. They provide support in my running shoes, and helped me recover from and prevent further IT band syndrome. I only give it 4 stars because of the price relative to other products on the market."
5.0,The amount of support it gives for your foot arch is perfect!
4.0,"I stand all day at work. Not walk around, stand on an assembly line. I got these to get rid of the foot pain I was starting to get. A couple of months later I still get some foot pain, but my back pain is gone! Never thought inserts would help with that!"
5.0,I paid a lot at a local foot specialist and realized these are the exact item. Im extremely happy with this purchase!
5.0,Good insoles I put in my work shoes for long shifts.
5.0,"Bought sets for all shoes. Similar quality to what my Podiatrist sold. Great support. I added some heal jells to soften the steps since these are not ""cushy."""
5.0,"Dad needed them for work, he's bought this brand before so he loves them since they fit perfectly."
1.0,"A good friend recommended these because I walk for 10 hours a night at work and my feet hurt after every shift, said they worked great for him. They didn't work for me, after about 5 hours of walking with these in my shoes not only my feet but also my knees and back were killing me, I took them back out and will never put them back in again."
4.0,Good fit and quality. Use it in running shoes for my son who has flat feet and got used to it easily and without complaining of discomfort. Can be lesser in price.
5.0,Love these for Plantar fasciitis
5.0,"Fit great, and the support is very nice. Love them! Want to get them for all my shoes."
2.0,"This product must be a knockoff,I only used it 3 times and the blue skin on top already peeled off. I have several of this that I have used for years that are still good,not this one. Unfortunately,this is not returnable,total waste of money."
5.0,Item came as described. They work well
4.0,Exactly as described.
5.0,"I've tried over 30 different insoles over the years.  From basic insoles to custom fitted ones and these Pinnacles are comparable to the best at a very reasonable price.  Excellent cushioning, support, and very comfortable.  You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Best thing next to floating on air
1.0,not happy these have not been used my husband thought they were gel which they are not most unhappy part that they can not be returned
5.0,Bought two pair for less than the price of one from my local retailer.  Great product.  I use them in my tennis shoes and daily wear shoes.  Significantly reduces foot fatigue.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who walks a lot or stands on their feet.
5.0,"I work almost all day on my feet. These inserts are absolutely THE best thing I have ever walked on. I have went through many pairs of shoes with the mileage I put on them, and I will be putting these in all work shoes I purchase from now on."
2.0,I have worn these inserts about 10 times total and within this time period the top fabric layer is already peeling off.
5.0,I cannot believe how much they have relieved my foot pain when I am wearing shoes.  Only bad thing is that they won't fit in my boots or dress shoes.  I have them in my tennis shoes & they are amazing.
5.0,"fit as expected,prompt delivery and fair price"
4.0,These are life savers for me.  I walk for a living and can't be without them.  I get about 3 months out of a pair... but I walk a lot!
5.0,"I originally received a pair of these from my physical therapist. Combined with running shoes that already provide some arch support, they really do help with my tendency to over-pronate when I walk. If I put them in my flat walking shoes, they're not quite as effective for me because of how high my arches are, but it's still better than no support at all. I found that the Women's 9-9.5 size fit in my size 9 sneakers just fine without me needing to trim it at all."
3.0,"After walking in them for 3 weeks. It seem like if I walk a great deal, my right heel starts to hurt."
5.0,"These are by far the best insoles. Forget Dr Scholls, these are the real deal."
1.0,"The arch is too high/firm but Be AWARE there is no returns at all, doesn't matter if they have not been worn"
5.0,"I don't think they are ""healing"" my plantar faciatis, but they certainly are helping relieve some pain."
5.0,I've been wearing these for several years to help with the soreness in the pads of my feet and the plantar fasciitis
4.0,Great product but I had to cut them down to fit into my shoe. I am a size 12 so I got the largest size but I shouldve gotten a size smaller.
5.0,I don't recommend a lot of things but if you have developed plantar faciitis these are GREAT. I was a little skeptical at first but as soon as I wore them I was convinced. I'm a nurse and on my feet for 12-14 hours a day and these truly helped. Pain free now!!
1.0,"I used to buy inserts from a shoe store, store discontinued the ones that worked for me. At the new shoe store they recommended these for my new shoes. Left fit the right hurt my feet.  I figured one worked so I ordered another thinking okay maybe the one had the right foot off. Nope still painful.  Switched it to another shoe, same issue. Moralof the story, well rated really doesn't mean anything when it comes to insoles. Many brands left to try."
4.0,Comfortable insoles
5.0,My feet are Loving me now. Before they were screaming I HATE YOUUUUUU!!!!
3.0,"while these are super comfortable, it will not fit in all shoes. they are pretty thick so when you have a snug fitting pair of boots, your foot will not slide in. wish I new this before buying as they aren't refundable.
they work well in a pair of sneakers or anything not too constricting but not boots."
5.0,"These inserts were a game changer for me, after having seven months of plantar fasciitis pain my foot doctor recommended trying these, within three weeks the pain was gone.  I highly recommend these to anyone suffering from plantar fasciitis pain and or shinsplints, don't waste your money on super expensive $500 custom orthotics."
5.0,Very pleased. My second pair.
5.0,"I was having severe foot pain and since wearing these, I am able to hike again."
5.0,Feel great.
5.0,it is the best I have tried
4.0,Great for those who suffer from planters fasciitis but don't want to spend big bucks on custom orthopedic inserts.  Only downside is that it makes the top of my foot rub a little on my shoe.
4.0,"They fit, and I like them,
Ill see how they hold up."
4.0,I bought one pair and liked them so much I bought another.
5.0,I use this type and brand exclusively and have many pairs so I can keep them in shoes I wear often
5.0,Perfect fit
4.0,I like the most was the softness my heel feel when I put them in my sneakers and the pain is so much less!
5.0,Great support. Great comfort. Great construction.
5.0,"I have purchased this produt before. My first experience with this product was from my foot doctor. He has this in his office and highly recommended it. I have these in most of my shoes. The ones I don't, I take out of the ones I do, and put them in the ones I use! A tip, take out the insoles of the shoes before you insert these in your shoe."
5.0,Great; cheaper than buying at the doctor's office
5.0,Really saves your feet when you have to stand long periods.
5.0,Helped relive my bone spur pain.
5.0,Great product at a very good price.  Promptly shipped.
5.0,"I love these. As a mail carrier, I'm on my feet up to 14 hours a day, and these provide arch support that other insoles and pretty much all shoes do not. Before buying these, I needed to soak my feet every day after work because they hurt so much. After using these, my feet feel fine. The blue part rubs off after a while, exposing the sticky yellow cushion underneath, which comes apart with friction. Best to use a cheap squishy insole on top for added cushion and to protect this one from falling apart."
5.0,"Like many reviewers, I have tried many shoe insoles over the years, and my 62 year old flat feet give a two thumbs up for Powerstep. Last year I purchased the Powerstep Original insoles and they worked well, not quite as stiff as my Soft Soles, but provided good support. ESPECIALLY FOR FLAT FEET, ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO MUCH ARCH. They seem to have survived moderate use, seem to be constructed with quality materials.
I definitely upped my game with the Pinnacle model. Supportive, stiff yet soft, I now have 3 pairs for different shoes."
5.0,Great for plantar fasciitis
3.0,"Been using this product for a week and there is not enough arch support. I have high arches and work in kitchens, at the end of day my feet were in pain and swollen from not enough support. I was previously using a cheaper product that was actually supporting my arches well, but cause I work in kitchens only last me 3 months. I only tried this cause I thought it might be better quality since it was more expensive, I was so wrong. Powerstep is thinner and more flimsy then the Sof Sole Arch Full Length Comfort High Arch Shoe Insole ... I went back to Sof Sole."
5.0,Perfect
4.0,Almost as good as my custom insoles. very strong arch
5.0,I have been using similar orthotics and was unable to find them.  Found these and they are great.  Great fit and very comfortable.  Good support and thicker cushioning for a more comfortable wear.
5.0,These are great for my feet. I buy a new pair every time I get a new pair of shoes. Won't live without them.
4.0,works good
5.0,Super comfortable great price
5.0,works nicely
5.0,a must for painful feet on concrete
5.0,"Perfect, very comfortable insoles."
5.0,My podiatrist recommended these for my plantar fasciitis.  This is my second pair...i love them.
2.0,"Admittedly, I have a shallow instep.  That being said, these insoles have a ginormous instep.  Having purchased probably 15 pairs of insoles over the years...I have never run into the situation where I simply can not tolerate them within 30 seconds...going back."
5.0,"Lifesaver.

I have terrible plantar fasciitis. Im walking on clouds with these. I replaced my insoles in favorite pair of toms (toms are the worst for people with plantar fasciitis btw).

Best decision ever."
3.0,I would prefer Superfeet.
5.0,Were them in every shoe i have.
5.0,Great product! I have brought about eight pairs!
3.0,Did not support me as I had anticipated. I ended up buying a more expensive one from Dicks Sporting Good store.
5.0,Helps my plantar fasciitis tremendously!
4.0,Not bad insoles. A little high for me but my boyfriend is wild about them. I have flat feet and plantar fasciitis for three years. He barely has plantar fasciitis in one foot but wears boots and needs a good support under him. He complains that he needs more of them.
1.0,Very hard and uncomfortable
5.0,These are the best
5.0,I've worn orthotics for years; these work well-I was even able to use my true shoe size.  My old ones I had to go up a full size.
5.0,fit perfect
5.0,I have several of these and use a pair in all my shoes.
5.0,like it
1.0,Very thick and not very soft. Went back to dr schools.
5.0,"These are great! My feet are finally comfortable again! I've tried other inserts with limited success, but as soon as I used these, my feet started feeling better. Not perfect, but better.  Too many years of buying inexpensive, inferior shoes, I suppose.  These inserts supported my insoles and helped a lot with the plantar fasciitis pain I'd been having for so long. I can switch them to different shoes, but having more than one pair would make sense since they fit snugly into the shoe. Great product!"
5.0,Has helped with plantar fasciitis. I have these in all my shoes and hiking boots.
5.0,Love powersteps!!!! Better than any custom orthotics I have had made!
5.0,These work well if you use them AS WELL as doing recommended plantar fascitis exercised religiously.
4.0,So far so good.for bad heel pain. Think I like these better than Vionic.  These fit better in arch and heel cup by a long shot.
1.0,These were flat within a week.
5.0,I have always been looking for the right arch support inserts for my plantars foot and these work so well and give the best support that I have tried. It was well worth the money
5.0,Amazing insoles. My foot fatigue is almost non-existent now. I'm in the restaurant industry and I'm on my feet 55-60 hours a week and my feet feel amazing. I can't recommend these enough.
5.0,"I've been having some foot problems so I started putting these into my everyday work shoes.  When I showed them to my orthopedic surgeon, he said they're even better than anything he would have given me, which to me says a lot.  I'll probably be buying more for my other shoes"
5.0,Fitness instructor - I use these as extra support and cushioning in my workout shoes. Works well.
5.0,"These insoles have helped with the pain I have from plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. I instantly felt the relief. After reading the reviews of other insoles, I decided to get these and I'm glad I did. I used to take my shoes off as soon as I get home now I'm able to keep them on for much longer. I have wide feet so it made the toe box of  my shoe a little narrow, but after taking out the original insole the fit is perfect."
4.0,Needed the 4 E size. This was too narrow for my shoe
5.0,Great in my New Balance shoes.  Caused some pain in my slip on shoes and I couldn't wait to take them off.  Fit well in both pairs of shoes I have tried.  Run very true to size.
5.0,Love these!! Have horrible plantar fasciitis and wore them to an amusement park. They really helped me make it.
5.0,I always get the inserts. I work in the medical field and it really helps my feet and the longevity of my shoes.
5.0,Perfect fit
4.0,find them very comfy but one insole is a bit diffrant in size on the edges
5.0,Have ordered previously.  Very satisfied with the product.
5.0,represented accurately!
5.0,fits great. I don't where my shoes without them.
4.0,There insoles help my shoes to be more comfortable
5.0,great support
5.0,"Very comfortable, much more comfortable then orthotics measured for my feet. .  Fit perfectly in my shoes.  Would recommend"
5.0,Made my old shoes feel like new and my feet are not aching at the end of the day. I enjoy walking for exercise again. Highly recommend!
5.0,Vert comfortable and supportive insoles.
5.0,Fantastic comfort
5.0,These have really helped me with my plantar fasciitis. it took me about 2 days to get use to them but so far they have relieved some of the pain. I will be buying about 3 more pairs to wear in different shoes.
1.0,"Ive been wearing these consistently for over a week. Im on my feet constantly, walking on concrete for 8 hours, I have plantar fasciitis and these are not helping. I have a coworker they worked amazingly for, but unfortunately not for me. Im super bummed about it too cause my feet are killing me."
1.0,"Uncomfortable and too
Big for
Shoes"
5.0,Recommend
5.0,"I suffer from plantar fasciitis, so I was desperate for relief when I bought these inserts. They are so comfortable compared to regular insoles that come with my shoes. I have bought five pair so far."
5.0,"Foot pain is gone away! These are well worth the money,"
5.0,I buy this Brand several times a year . Whenever I buy new shoes
5.0,Best insoles I've ever owned! The pain in my feet is minimal if not totally gone.
5.0,"These are the most awesome orthotics I have ever had!!!  I was a loyal Superfeet user until I tried these.  What a difference in support, cushioning and overall comfort.  My feet feel so much better.  I highly recommend!"
5.0,Really helped my feet. Would purchase again!
5.0,"I can't express how much of a Godsend these insoles have been for me. I was very skeptical about dropping a good chunk of change of insoles but I am glad I did. Definitely worth the money. I purchased my first pair from a local sports store with knowledgeable employees on the subject of foot and knee pain. After much discussion and trying a few different ones out in the store, I decided on this one. My feet don't hurt nearly as much after standing on them for 8 hours, in work boots and on concrete. Surprisingly, these have also helped my aching knees as well. I bought this second pair on Amazon for when my current ones need replacing. I've been walking on my first pair for 4 months so far (40 hours/week). I will say, I will never go without again."
4.0,keeps the plantar at  bay for me.
5.0,Got rid of my plantar fasciitis!
2.0,"Stiff, little cushioning. Maybe better than nothing, but Ill return these and keep looking."
4.0,"These insoles have really helped my plantar fasciitis. However, after about 6 weeks of use, the blue cover is deteriorating on the right heel.  I am not sure I will repurchase."
5.0,My doctor recommended these for my plantar fasciitis. They seem to be working and the fit was perfect in my shoe.
3.0,"Decent insoles, but I found the durability lacking.  Wore out after about 7 months, although I do walk a lot."
1.0,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made in my life.

It has a hard protrusion on the center of my feet and it tormented me all day. I was twisted and crippled after hours of use. I felt like my spine had been misaligned. I have never experienced as much pain as I did after wearing these.

None refundable.

Worst purchase of my life."
5.0,Perfectly priced and a great fit for my plantar fasciitis.
5.0,good for the price
4.0,they work as well as the more expensive ones.  I have VERY flat feet and have to wear orthotics or special shoes in order to avoid very painful joints.  These are MUCH less expensive as many others I have tried and they work just as well as the more expensive ones.
3.0,"Little short for my sneaker, but fits my shoes perfectly. I wear sneakers more often than shoes.  Wearing on end from using in my sneaker because just a little to short."
5.0,Made my pain go away!
5.0,I have a very high arch and this works as well as my very expensive medical orthotic. It started squeaking when I walked as I had removed the insert that came with the tennis shoes. I then put the orthotic on top of the original insert and the squeak went away and also fits better.
4.0,"These are very comfy when u first put them in your shoe. They add a lot of cushion. However, they aren't as supportive to my arches as I would like. Something a little firmer works better to prevent back pain for me"
2.0,"These eliminated the pain in my feet from the factory insoles of my work boots. I am on my feet all day, and most of the time carrying extra weight from tools. That might have caused them to wear out quicker, still, I only got 3 months out of them. Even so, these are still the best yet.

Update: I ordered these again thinking maybe I got a defective pair the first time around. The answer is no. Still, right at the 3 month mark, they start to fall apart. The plastic on the heel moves and sticks up making it very painful. It could be the high impact, but at $30/pair, I cannot afford to keep investing in an insole with such a short life."
4.0,"These have been a lifesaver for me. The have alleviated a lot of foot pain and they have done wonders for helping me not twist my ankle.
I would give them five stars if they lasted longer."
1.0,"I will start by saying that I have been using powerstep pinnacle for awhile now and they are great for Planar fasciitis. However recently I have had problems with 2 pairs of them. The heel cup migrated forward in  the insole. This made them very uncomfortable and worthless. I contacted powerstep to report the problem and was totally blown off. They told me that the company who sold them through Amazon was not an authorized reseller and refused to honor their guarantee. I wore them for 2 days and they are trash. Very unhappy with their customer service. I thought they might actually stand by their products, but I can see that they don't. They have lost a long time customer who works in surgery and has recommended them to many people who have foot issues. Well now that will change. As you can see in the photos the heel cup is out of place."
4.0,Work well. After a week of using my pain from walking starting going away. Arch support really does help. Bought one for each of my shoes that I wear on a regular basis.
5.0,"Bought these for my brother, and was delighted that product gave him immediate relief from plantar faciatis."
5.0,These work good enough that I didn't have to replace my shoes. They worked out good enough so I bought another pair for another pair of shoes.
5.0,This has helped my feet so much! I never thought it would. My Dr recommended them.
5.0,"Recommended by my doctor. Work so good, I put them in all my shoes."
4.0,I have purchased several of these supports over the years. I am happy with the quality and support these inserts provide.
5.0,"My foot doctor recommended these to me since I can't afford custom orthotics and I will be ordering another pair! Best money ever spent. My feet, knees and his don't hurt nearly as bad as they used to after a 16 hour work day"
3.0,"surface came loose after 1 month, not enough instep. Purchased Spenco instead, much better quality and arch lift."
5.0,"I wear size 12 and it fit perfect, didn't have to trim."
5.0,Quality is everything!
5.0,The best. Confortable and firm. Really offers a relief.
5.0,really like them feet feel better
5.0,such comfort
4.0,"I had bought this size before, so I knew it would fit."
2.0,Too bulky for anything but boots.  Too much arch. Material seems alright. Useless to me though.
5.0,Great fit!
5.0,"Best inserts Ive ever had besides custom molded inserts that can cost hundreds of $$$.

Hold up well."
5.0,I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and these give me the support I need to keep it from returning. Love them.
5.0,"Great product, delivered on time, and looks brand new."
2.0,These things flattened out after a few days of wearing them. There is not much notice of them being there and I guess that could be a good thing but they are not what I was looking for.
4.0,Husband is happy!
4.0,Used by my wife. She loves these. They work better than others she has tried.
3.0,Seems like a high quality product but too much arch support for my liking.
5.0,"Great product. Makes every other brand seem cheap (even the famed Dr. Scholl's). My Foot/Ankle doctor recommend this brand rather than making orthopedics for me, which would have been incredibly expensive. He hit the nail on the head. I joke with him that he should get a commission, but obviously, he cannot. Walking on concrete is hell for me, but these have taken away much of the pain. I highly recommend this product."
5.0,"I have worn only a day and felt they were helpful, but do not have the problem my hub has , His reaction is better source of successs."
5.0,ok
5.0,Love these!!! 3rd pair Ive purchased.  Have major foot problems and have spent a lot of money on custom orthotics.  These are the best and worth every penny!!!!!
5.0,they  work  great
5.0,"By wearing these orthotics, I have almost no foot pain.  I used to have plantar fasciitis and spent lots of money.  These have worked better or as well as than my past expensive orthotics"
5.0,Very comfortable.  Use them in my walking shoes.
1.0,"I see why it isn't eligible for returns, it actually made my heel hurt worse."
5.0,Love these. I have an extra bone in the ball of my right foot and by the end of most days would be limping. After buying these it's no longer an issue
1.0,"They where nice for about three weeks, fabric on them started to peel.
they shrunk.
And lost their comfort."
5.0,"I have orthotics that I was fitted for at a podiatrist, which cost a few hundred dollars; these work just as well for me! I have purchased 4 pairs of them!!!"
4.0,Have used this type of insert for years. These allow me to get a full six months out of a pair of shoes and is a relief for my plantar fasciitis.
5.0,"Seems to work well with my fallen arches. I initially thought that the arch support would not be rigid enough for my weight so I tried placing some small gel supports in the space beneath the insole's arch, but that setup got a bit uncomfortable after a while.. So I took my improvised additional support out and now it is much more comfortable.  It turns out that the way it was designed, with a rigid yet somewhat flexible arch support, actually works better for my feet."
5.0,These things are pretty great! Not sure if they are a complete dupe for Superfeet but they work well and are sturdy to last a long while.
4.0,"Purchased this item to replace worn inserts that came with a pair of athletic shoes.  Initial reaction was too much arch support, borderline uncomfortable, while at the same time noticing that having the extra arch support seems to be taking the weight off the outside of my foot relieving a noticeable amount of pain from a metatarsal fracture.  Adhering to the suggestion of following a break in period to allow for your foot to adjust I increased the amount of time I wore the shoes over few days before hitting the trail.  After a week or two I'm back up to a goal of 5-10 miles per day, and while I still notice the arch support for a brief period at the start of each hike it quickly fades into the background now that my focus is getting to the peak rather than allowing the foot pain to determine a turn around point.

Having had consistent foot pain for several weeks I made an appointment with a podiatrist who determined that as a result of my stride and bone structure I place a lot of weight on the outside of my foot which likely caused the stress fractures, walking around barefoot or flip flops when not hitting the trails or at the office is not at all conducive to a quick recovery.  Doctors advice, besides to stay off your feet, is to minimize walking barefoot, wear athletic shoes as much as possible for the cushion and support, invest in good dress shoes for work.  Learnings from mostly following his advise: proper footwear greatly accelerated the healing process and insoles could be a large part of the solution depending on your specific situation, and the insoles that come with shoes may not offer proper support, and will likely need to be replaced several times over life (miles not age) of your shoes."
5.0,Love them!!! Make a big difference in the way my feet feel!!!
5.0,Pricey but oh so worth it!!!!!
5.0,Like them better than my $400 orthotics podiatrist recommended.  Ortho recommended these!
5.0,Have only used them for a few days but they seem great. Nice and comfy with good arch support. Will be ordering more.
5.0,We buy these all the time from year to year for the whole family. We never use factory insoles and actually take these with us to try on new shoes with these in.
4.0,Very comfortable and back seems to feel much better.
5.0,I never knew I needed these until I tried them on. I love them and make my feet feel comfortable while I walk. However These are to big for my shoes width and make my feet look really big
5.0,"Love these! I hate wearing bras and these are the perfect alternative. Yes they do ""wrinkle"" and if I wear something very thin or sheer, you could see the sticker through the shirt, but if you can see that much, I don't want to wear that shirt anyway. They will make my skin SLIGHTLY red, but only if I wear them for like 12 hours. When I use them, I don't have the ""headlight"" look and people have no idea I'm not wearing a bra. They don't hurt to remove, even of I have worn them for a long time. I'm getting ready to re-order soon!"
5.0,My dad who has foot issues asked me to order these for him and he loves them. Once my dad raved about how much he loved them I got some for my husband and he loves them.
1.0,I thought these would be comfortable but that was not the case. I tried them out once and they were no different than the standard orthotic that came my New Balance athletic shoe.  I'll stick to my tried and true Aetrex brand orthotics which are also available on Amazon.  I hope the Powerstep Orthotics will help someone else -- I put them back in their package and donated them to charity. I do not recommend these.
5.0,I have always had trouble finding the right insole that works for me because of my size and weight. I have to wear steel toe boots all day and walk around in them all day my feet would always hurt at the end of the day. Once I try these insoles the pain in my feet went away and never came back these are great great insoles to purchase I suggest you buy them immediately
5.0,Second pair I bought.  They fit and work very well
5.0,Awesome insoles - very comfortable!  Def recommend
5.0,Quick shipment and works as advertised
5.0,"Been using these for years. Took it about 6 months worth of use before my planters fasciitis cleared up, been using these ever since. Oder a couple of pairs a year, one for running shoes and one for work boots. Each insole lasts about a year before I have to replace them."
5.0,The foam is very cheep
2.0,Wore for one day and feet hurt more with the inserts more.
5.0,Very good foot support at a great price.  I have worn Dr. Scholl's custom orthotics($50) as well as prescription orthotics($200-$500).  I experience foot pain often especially if I am standing on concrete for any length of time.  Good orthotics in sturdy footwear helps a lot.  I could not wear athletic shoes for more than about 30 minutes without my feet aching until I put a pair of these orthotics in my New Balance shoes.  I will buy more.
5.0,These fit well and made my shoes like new. Shoes that were causing my feet to hurt are now comfortable. Very good arch support. They are so good I bought a second pair.
5.0,Buying some more real soon.
5.0,"Perfect fit for my 12 and a half double E Brooks GTS 17 shoes. Great cushion for running five miles a day. They last me three months, which is a month more than any other insert I've tried."
2.0,"These insoles are not made for tennis shoes, or running shoes, or walking shoes. They push your foot too high up and your heel will rub on the back of the shoe while the top of your foot will try to pop out of the shoe like you're Frankenstein's monster. I bought these based on the reviews, but honestly don't know what I can use them in--Moon boots?"
5.0,I wear these in all my shoes and it has cured my plantar fasciitis that I suffered with for many years.
5.0,It works like magic for me.
4.0,"these do help, will see how long they will last."
5.0,"Has cured my arch issues.  Now, both myself and the wife has them in all of our shoes, boots, sneakers."
5.0,very pleased with this product
5.0,I would always wake up with pain my arch and heel every monring.  Almost like the tendons in the foot tightened up overnight.  It would go away after 5 or 10 minutes of walking around in the morning but still hurt to walk.  After a week of wearing these consistently I no longer have any foot pain in the morning.
5.0,great inserts  less than half the price of shoe stores for the same insert
5.0,Comfortable and has improved balance.
5.0,I felt instant relief with these inserts.
3.0,"First off let me say I love these insoles!  Im a moderate pronater with high arches and these insoles have made long days on my feet much more tolerable. I have them in my work boots, golf shoes and walking/running shoes.

Now about the 3 star review. The only reason Im giving anything other than 5 stars is that the cloth cover on the insoles has either begun to peel off or peeled off completely. (See pic). Without the cloth cover its almost impossible to slide your feet into your shoes. Ive had to use spray glue to reattach the cloth and it only temporarily fixes it. The comfort outweighs the problem with the covering so I will continue to purchase these for all my shoes, however, I really hope this problem is addressed and fixed soon."
1.0,"I don't know where all these 5 star reviews came from, maybe those people got a better product, but what I got was terrible. There's basically no cushioning in these whatsoever. I tried them out at work for a few hours, and was very disappointed. They have a super thin top ""cushion"" layer, and below that is a very hard, rigid base. I'll never buy these types of products online again, this product isn't eligible for return. Just go to the store and get the $13 Doctor Scholls, they're 100 times better than these."
5.0,These inserts work well and cost less than others of similar quality.  I will order them again.
5.0,These insoles are great! I purchased these from my doctor originally and paid more.
5.0,"Have bought these before and they are perfect, recommended by my pediatrist for plantar faciitis."
1.0,It was too thick. Should've ordered the trim one. Cut around on it so I was unable to return it.  It's stated that it was for several different foot problems and my problem was Morton's Neuroma. But it was too high in the arch and uncomfortable since I have a normal arch
5.0,Last  for one year. Much cheaper  on Amazon  than buying  it from the New Balance Store.
5.0,"They fit, they slide right inside my shoes w/o trimming, and it's what the orthopedic doc recommended for plantar fasciitis."
4.0,
5.0,Great for high arch support. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,great insoles
2.0,Dont wear the long insoles.
2.0,"Runs very small. Bought the Size 12-13.5 in mens. Fit snug & perfectly inside an 11.5 2E Mens boot.

Cushioning around the arch/heel is very good. However there was basically none in the toe area. After a few days of wearing these at work I had shooting, stabbing pains. My toes were very sore due to the lack of padding.

Overall not worth the money... unless you don't plan to walk a whole lot with them.

My feet feel much better with the Doctor Scholls ""Work"" insoles. If only they had the arch like these do."
4.0,I had to cut these down a lot but my feet feel great when wearing them.
1.0,"I should have known that something wasn't right when no size options were listed on the Powerstep website. I ordered anyway and received insoles that were neither long nor wide enough for my shoes. The box they came in was crushed in delivery and I, unfortunately, threw it away before noticing that the insoles were all-around too small. In the past, I've been totally satisfied with the Powerstep insoles, but this time was a disappointment. Do not order if no size options are listed."
5.0,Pretty happy with these I soles. Would buy them again.
3.0,thoght it might help my plantar facciitis but do not like the feel.
5.0,These fit well and give excellent support.
5.0,Foot doctor recommended this product and gives good support. Also has enough cushion to use in work shoes.
5.0,These were recommended by my podiatrist because I have arthritis on the top of my feet. They help tremendously and allow me to walk with relative comfort. I have tried many other orthotics and these are the best for my foot.
4.0,A little narrow.
5.0,always love these
3.0,"I think I need to trim the end a little.  It doesn't quite fit my arch.  A little too far back. Construction seems solid. Makes me wonder if a custom fit insert would be a better, but I know it would cost a lot more."
3.0,I like the power step protech control pro much better. Do you still carry those?
1.0,"These inserts felt ok for a while in my work Echos, but I slowly developed severe pain under the ball of my right foot.  The pain was gone four days after I stopped using them."
5.0,Great support. On my third pair.
3.0,Very thick and hard to fit in womens shoes.  Arch is a little uncomfortable as it is pretty high.
4.0,They are ok.
4.0,Have used this product for many years and have not had any foot problems since using it.
5.0,Ive used Powerstep Pinnacle insoles for years for plantar facitis issues and they work great!
5.0,Love them.
5.0,Love these
5.0,Performance to be counted on.
5.0,A staple for all my shoes. Get plantar fasciitis without it.
5.0,Perfect fit for me and very sturdy for a great price.  I mean the arch isn't made out of a formed metal like the expensive ones are but they do an exceptional job and provide very adequate support for my flat feet.  I have them in all my shoes and I highly recommend them!
5.0,Great for flat feet. Very comfortable.
5.0,These help to walk without any foot pain.
5.0,"I suffered with plantar fasciitis for years. I don't know why I did not try new insoles sooner. I guess I just thought that it could not be that simple. Within two days of wearing these insoles, my plantar fasciitis was almost completely gone. I no longer suffer from this debilitating pain, and I am free to get out of bed without fear of hurting. These Powersteps were money well spent."
4.0,Nice
5.0,These are amazing and a huge help!!!
1.0,Garbage. They are super flimsy and started coming apart the first week.
1.0,Don't waste your money. These are so hard. The arch is in the wrong place so they hurt really bad. I hate them and am so angry that I wasted my money on them. I want my money back.
4.0,"So far so good, they are a little warm but a huge step up in comfort. Im in work boots indoors and these help relieve some of the pressure on my feet."
4.0,"Love it, purchased a 2nd one for the another pairs.  It definitely alleviates the pain in my heel and able to wear with casual and sports shoes.  One caution is the height.  It does not offer different level of thickness for support like other brands (higher review counts).  This one is more of a medium which worked out perfect for daily working/casual shoes.  I am planning purchase a lower profile for my Nike workout shoes."
5.0,A must have in my shoes!
5.0,I've tried many different insoles and these are absolutely the best for me.
1.0,Doesn't even fit in my shoe. Now it says this product isn't available for return.
3.0,"I tried these instead of the superfeet that I had previously.  They seem to run small.  I have about a half inch of space between the end of my shoe and the end of the insert.  They definitely seem to give arch support.  I thought they would have more cushioning for plantar fasciitis, but they also seem pretty comparable to the superfeet blue that I had been using.  Overall, they are ok."
4.0,Seems to run a little on the large side but not really a problem as there easily trimmed to fit. They were recommended by my podiatrist.
5.0,"I've used these orthotics for several years at the suggestion of my podiatrist, and they have relieved some of the problems I was having.  He charges $45 per pair so I started buying them online.  This pair was for the wife and she loves them."
5.0,"fit as expected - last several years - never seem to wear out, but they begin to look their age.- I have them in all my shoes."
4.0,Second time I've purchased these and I love them ordered two more
5.0,"Hubby was very happy with length and durability of the sole. It has been a couple months now. He has gout and plantar fasciitis, so managing to easily interchange it from tennis shoe to boot to flats easily was a huge plus. He is mens 13 a little wide."
5.0,Almost immediately solved the issue I was having where the arch of my foot was popping once in a while.
5.0,My therapist recommended these and their great!!!!
5.0,size 12 fit true.  support was very comfortable.
5.0,perfect!
4.0,fits and works as eaxpected
5.0,I am in love with these. I had to get a second pair because I wanted some that were only for my running shoes. These things have helped me resume my active career as a military officer.
5.0,"Just what I expected.  Also, I received them in no time at all!"
5.0,"Ive only had them for a week but so far Im very happy with the fit and being able to wear them in different shoes.
Im a hairstylist and on my feet for 10 hour days so I am all about comfort!
I also received them fast!
So all said, I would definitely recommend them!"
5.0,I use these in my slippers and they give me the support and padding I need.
5.0,"I put these insoles into a pair of sport sandals, and they fit into the sandals perfectly.  They are very comfortable!"
4.0,Average arch support. Not a lot of padding in the heal. Fairly thin.
3.0,"Purchased because of good reviews. I'm not saying these are bad insoles, they just did not do anything for me.
I still have severe foot pain due to plantar fasciitis and am going to try something else."
5.0,I have used this brand for years and have I am very pleased with them.
5.0,These items arrived on time and as advertised. So far so good.  Thanks!
5.0,"These were recommended by my podiatrist. Ordering was simple, and they arrived quickly. My shoe is a size 7 and they fit perfectly right out of the package!
I have never used insoles before, but WOW, what a difference these make!! After first few hours of wearing these, my feet felt better than they had in years!
Highly recommend."
5.0,Works perfect
5.0,As advertised.
1.0,
5.0,Fantastic
5.0,"Ive used these for years to help with plantar facciitis, as per doctors orders.  Just time for a fresh pair."
5.0,"These are SOOOOO comfortable, but better yet, supportive. I'm dealing with some plantar fasciitis and they're really helping get relief. I ordered the first pair just to try them after doing some research online. After receiving them, I inserted them into my hiking shoes and went for a 5 mile hike. I couldn't believe how much they helped and my foot wasn't in so much pain afterwards. I immediately ordered 4 more pair for other shoes.  I wear a size 9 shoe and they slipped right in without any trimming. Highly recommend these orthotics!"
5.0,Just purchased a second pair. Very comfortable & supportive.
4.0,"I buy regular width shoes, and these are too wide towards the rear part of the shoe. You can only trim the front of these of inserts not the rear. On many normal width dress shoes these inserts will rest on the walls of the shoe and stretch it out. Besides for dimension issues these provide excellent support for my low arch and also provide nice cushioning throughout."
2.0,Fell apart after couple weeks of wearing them. Before they fell apart they were good. Fix that problem and you might have something.
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,"Same thing I've always got, so I knew what to expect."
5.0,"Performs well, my second set purchased so that I do not waste time moving insoles from one pair of shoes to another."
5.0,Wish I would have known about these sooner. As good as my $250 insoles from Podiatrist.
5.0,The orthotics are great.  I think they are helping my knee pain.
5.0,Very comfortable! Was looking for something similar to Superfeet without the higher price and I think I have found it. Working on my feet 8 hours a day destroys my shoes and insoles quick so I will be coming back for these when this pair can take no more abuse.
4.0,"It's a little snug when I run, but it definitively helped with my knee pains while running."
5.0,"These were recommended by my podiatrist, and I am very happy with them."
5.0,"I have bee looking around on Amazon I saw these were reasonably priced and decided to give them a try. I have been pleasantry surprised with how comfortable these make my cheaper boots. I have high arches and find most shoes uncomfortable except tennis shoes but I don't want to wear those 24-7. Helps my feet immensely. Better than the metatarsal pads that slip out from under your feet. I have tried the gel ones that are for comforter but I cant go more then an hour without them slipping these do not slip and the padding is quite comfortable. I have some shoe's that allow for an additional insert. I have removed the inserts that came with my shoe's and replaced with these, in shoes that don't allow for an additional insert."
5.0,"So i work on steel decks and my feet hurt from long days of work.  Ive tried the copper super feet which is probably the best so far.  Also I've used the abeo from the walking store which is also very very good.  At the price point i think these are the best.  I also used the other green super feet and i hated those, they were a bit to hard.  Also all the other cheap ones that you can buy in walgreens, i seriously wouldn't bother.  Abeo's are better, super feet copper are my second fav.  This one is my third but for the price this one is probably the one to buy."
4.0,"My podiatrist was quite pleased with these. The length was spot on, the arch is ridged but well padded, and the heal is nice and deep. All in all, for the price, they can't be beat!"
5.0,"Got them for plantar faciitis.  They have made it feel much better.  Plan to wear them as much as possible to prevent it, too."
5.0,Helps prevent my shin splints
4.0,Love these things but I wish they would last just a bit longer.  The harder portion of the heel starts to poke through the softer top layer at the heel after a few months.
1.0,Only lasted two weeks and fell apart.
5.0,Good!
5.0,Great support. Fits my shoes nicely. Much better support than the removable insoles that are in my shoes.
5.0,"I bought one pair and fell in love. I've been having issues with plantar fasciitis and my doctor recommended orthotics. Before spending hundreds of dollars ordering them from him, I did some research and then ordered a pair of these. They were so wonderful I ordered another two pairs. Great arch support but also cushiony and springy. These are great for my more dressy work shoes as well as my walking shoes. I love to walk, but the cushioned insole in my walking shoes weren't giving me enough support. Because they are a combo of men/women sizes, they were a bit wide for my shoes, but you can trim the sides to make them more narrow to fit your shoes. Would highly recommend for those suffering from plantar fasciitis or need extra arch support."
5.0,what a life saver for my feet!
5.0,As expected
5.0,"These are excellent, well worth the money, making my running shoes like new again.  I had just ordered a new pair of shoes a few days earlier and saw these and thought I would put in my old shoes and use them for outside, crazy, now have two pairs of workout shoes."
1.0,Size  14 is MUCH TOO LARGE for size 14 shoe(s). Instead of drastically cutting it uo I'm returning item. Was about to order a smaller size but It is 50 % more expensive ... really ... 50% more for a smaller size. There are lot's of alternative products on the market (Amazon).
5.0,"Husband loves these. Hes on his feet all day for work, and walks about 18k steps a day in these. Hes been wearing them for a few months now with this kind of use and they are still in great shape. We will absolutely buy again!"
5.0,Best insoles. I have been buying them for years. They work really well and very comfortable.
5.0,3rd pair works great
4.0,"I am size 10 and all my shoes (dress shoes, sneakers etc) are size 10. I bought size 10 insole.
I had to trim the front a little bit with a pair of scissors.
The sides are too wide near the middle, but there is no good way to trim it. It does make my sneakers look bigger.
I bought this to relieve my foot pain near the big toe. I think the arch support from this insole helps a lot. It did not completely cure my problem, but i will say it is a cheap and effective solution to help with my foot pain."
5.0,"The Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics are fantastic!!!  I inserted them in my badly worn Asics walking shoes and now they feel even more comfortable than when they were new.  I didn't remove the original soles, but the shoes don't feel too tight and the cushioning is excellent.  I often experience severe pain in my feet after walking for several hours, but there's been no pain recently.  Am anxious to wear them when we travel next time.  Highly recommended."
5.0,My feet feel so much better with the pinnacle insoles! The foot pain is going away!
3.0,They are ok. Just nothing to write home about.
4.0,Comfortable
3.0,"Returned because the arch was too high, too far back, and the cushioning not really existent. I'm sure these will be great for someone but they were uncomfortable, even painful, for me making them unwearable. Three stars for being well-made and sturdy."
5.0,Good product!
4.0,It gives a great support
4.0,"good support, fit perfectly"
5.0,I have been running in comfort with these type of  inserts for the past 7 years.  I think they are the equivalent of custom orthotics that I used to wear due to my high arches.
3.0,Like the ones I used to have. They help support my feet.
1.0,"Didn't even last 2 months before right insole ripped. Can't recommend this product, waste of hard earned money."
4.0,"Fast delivery, just what I needed Thank you"
3.0,Not what I was expecting
5.0,"Very good insoles, my son loves them."
5.0,These are great! I've now ordered a second pair. I do a lot of hiking so I put these in my boots. I can literally hike all day in rugged terrain and my feet still feel fantastic when I'm done.
5.0,"These work well in my Brooks walkers, and my dress shoes. I found them to be average in my hiking boots, but perform well in the other two shoes. These work well for Plantar Fascitis, and fallen arches."
2.0,The toes are so pointy. Didn't work with my feet or shoes.
4.0,They really do work.
5.0,Made a world of difference to the pair of sneakers I used them in.
5.0,"Comfortable product to use, padded well."
5.0,These insoles have saved my feet. I had burning numbness until I found these!
4.0,Works fairly well.
5.0,"I wish I had a pair for every pair of shoes I own. My feet have been bothering me, and a friend shared with me her secret of using Powersteps Insoles in her shoes to stop her hip and foot pain. For about $20, I thought it was worth a try. It really has been a game changer for me. They fit into my tennis shoes as expected. After slipping out the other insole, the Powerstep Insoles fit perfectly into my shoe (tennis shoe/sneaker). They fit as expected, not too small or too large."
5.0,"I had a pair of these for 7 years. Time to replace them, hoping for 7 more. I use steel toe shoes for work and these make my shoes much more comfortable. I get my shoes a size larger and place these inside every pair."
4.0,"For these to be comfortable you need to remove your shoes' original insole and replace them with these. If you just put them right on top, the shoe gets too shallow and causes more discomfort. This makes transferring them from shoe to shoe more involved than expected. However, they are very comfortable and helpful for long periods of walking and standing."
5.0,These are awesome support. I put them in my running shoes and they are great.
5.0,"These were recommended by my podiatrist. After a day, the ashes are greatly diminished (plantar fascitis). I can't recommend them enough, and neither could my doctor."
5.0,"This orthotic has really helped ease my foot discomfort from planter fasciitis.
Good value for the money."
5.0,Very comfortabe and fit perfectly
5.0,The firm quality of the insert is better for one's foot as compared to the squishy jell supports.
4.0,second time I've orderd these. Should have bought them years ago! What a difference. Fit great.
5.0,I buy a set of these every year for my work boots.  Great insoles.  Will keep on buying.
2.0,After a week I feel no difference between these and the insoles that came with my sneakers.
5.0,"Better than competitors.  I am a healthcare provider and recommend this item to my patients often.  Alleviates foot and ankle pain, as well as knee, hip and low back pain associated with poor body mechanics from pes planus"
5.0,Great arch support.  Didn't have to cut down anything to fit.  Will see how long they last in future as I tend to go through insoles quickly as waiter.
5.0,"I've been buying these for years since being recommended by a podiatrist. They support for several months, but I usually buy a new pair before any trips where I know I'll be doing a lot of walking."
5.0,These are the best insoles I have ever had I only used them for a short period of time and I can already tell that the pain has decreased
5.0,My feet have really felt better!
4.0,A bit narrow at the front end so my big toe is half off but otherwise ok
5.0,"This insole cured plantar faciitis for me. I have been wearing these for 4 years now while playing tennis, and the plantar faciitis has not returned. They are sturdy and very supportive. The price was great as well.
Highly recommended."
5.0,I used these Powerstep inserts for years and I like them a lot!!
5.0,Great. Fixed some foot issues instantly.
5.0,A very comfortable fit. They have greatly reduced my heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis. I am very happy with this purchase.
5.0,My podiatrist recommended me wear these as I walk on concrete all day.  They are  Awesome!
5.0,These insoles really help mt plantar fasciitis.
5.0,"I have planters fasciitis in my left heal.  I walk miles each day, fast-paced.  If I did not have these insoles, I would not be able to accomplish this.  My Brooks running shoes are a big factor in allowing me to walk like this, but the insoles are wonderful.  No pain.  None.  I highly recommend anyone with this affliction to purchase these insoles!  Thank you so much!"
5.0,Another great product.  These fit in my casual Sketcher shoes.  Very comfortable and supportive for my arch.
5.0,works best in shoes that are new or close to new.  foot savers
5.0,The have made a huge difference in my comfort.
5.0,Really help my arch pain during pregnancy!
5.0,Just cut them to my size and they fit perfect!
5.0,Best insoles ever.
5.0,I've used this product before and it meets all my expectations.
4.0,Great fit
1.0,Cant wear any of my shoes with this thing in it!
5.0,Not cheap but they are durable and add comfort to hiking shoes and boots. Way better than the flimsy insoles which come with most boots.
5.0,"I put the orthotics in both my running and cycling shoes. I overpronate and the orthotics were as good or better than ones I had made for many times the price,  I will be a loyal customer."
5.0,I love these! My feet feel great!!
5.0,Husband loves them.
5.0,Was having pain in the top of my foot. Since using these inserts the pain has gone away.
5.0,Immediate difference in support and comfort.  Very pleased with their fit in my shoes.
5.0,Been wearing these for years.  Good deal on Amazon
5.0,"As recommended by my podiatrist for reducing pain on my instep and heal, the orthotics have given me significant improvement in comfort and mobility."
2.0,"These are alright, but not great. Makes my work boots to tight. I can leave them in about half of the day, but then they start to hurt."
5.0,"The orthotics fit into my sneakers as if they were made for them--no adjustment needed.  The Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics were comfortable from the very first day.  Because of the fit and comfort, I ordered two more sets online for my other shoes."
5.0,Good.
5.0,"I've been using this brand for nearly 10 years.  It's allowed me to continue running without pain.  Before finding Powerstep Pinnacle's, I tried other brands and none worked as well."
5.0,"Descently priced and overall amazing.  I have plantar fiscitis and tried other insoles.  So far, these are inferior to the others. Walked 2 miles immediately without an issue. They don't breath though and cause my feet to sweat, but for the comfort,  it's worth it."
4.0,Just okay.  Not as comfortable as other insoles i have used.
5.0,Perfect fit!! Love these and would order them again!!
5.0,Excellent product.  Will order again.
5.0,These insoles were comfortable right out of the box.  Great product highly recommended.
2.0,liked the first couple of pairs I had.  bought 2 pairs from Amazon in April and both immediately started falling apart.  the top blue layer starting falling off and was completely off over the course of a couple weeks.  unfortunate.
5.0,Love them
5.0,Works great
5.0,Makes walking and standing easier.  No more knee or hip pain.
5.0,The best insole I've ever purchased.
5.0,Work and fits great
5.0,good
5.0,"Fits just fine like the previous pair I ordered for my husband. Now I have a pair in each pair of boots I wear regularly, he says."
5.0,Fits in all of my shoes!
5.0,Love these. Very comfortable and affordable. Repeat buyer.
5.0,"I have extremely flat feet and often times at work I have to stand for hours on end.  Because of this, I have very sore feet and have dealt with plantar fasciitis.  I bought a set of these and a second set of the Maxx Full length to try out.  I started with Powerstep, and after getting used to them over a few days of wear, I beginning to feel relief from the pain.  I'll admit, the first day I was having second thoughts, because the arch supports were hurting a little, but like it says on box, you need to get your feet accustomed to them.  I'll probably return the Maxx Step wihtout even trying them, because I think the powerstep is all I need."
3.0,"Make me feel like my heel is going to come out of my shoes, but otherwise they are comfortable."
5.0,"Great insole, helped with heel pain and to correct pronation, my sons feet no longer hurt everyday! I would recommend these!"
5.0,Got them for my boyfriend for his work boots and his loves them!!!
5.0,"They fit the same as ones
I had purchased at a local store, but for half the cost."
5.0,"Almost immediately my feet felt better, especially after walking miles at a music festival this week."
1.0,Make sure that you know that these are right for you.  They are not for every foot type for sure and if they aren't the right insert for you  (they weren't for me) they will not accept returns so you are stuck with them.
5.0,"Fits just as expected, they feel great and well worth the price. They also Approved by the American Podiatry Institute & MADE IN THE USA!"
5.0,Amazing
5.0,I really like these.  They allow me to stand / walk all day. And they help with keeping my feet from suffering from plantar fasciitis.
5.0,These are great. They were recommended to me and I like to the feel.
5.0,This is my 3rd set and I love them. They make all of my closed toe shoes wearable. I have hammer toes with bones protruding on the bottom and flat feet --happy to be able to have a pain free day!
5.0,"I have much arthritis in one foot.  This Powerstep insole helps with the pain.  I had some older insoles, but this had an immediate impact on the pain."
4.0,"This orthotic helps ALOT,  but I am still having trouble.  I have VERY high arches and these don't give me quite as much support as I need.  They are comfortable and fit perfectly in my shoes.  I am very pleased as a whole.  Bought a second pair for another pair of shoes.  Would  Recommend."
5.0,these insoles healed my plantar fasciaitis. I wear them everyday. The only ones I buy!! They are trimable with a scissors around the toe if you need to adjust the fit a little.
5.0,They were so good I bought another pair for my dress shoes.  So good to find good things. James
2.0,"Not as expected.  They're very hard and don't feel supportive at all. The reviews were good, not what I was hoping for, though.  They aren't cushy,  and make being on my feet all day long extremely difficult.  Maybe they'll work for someone else, but they didn't for me ."
5.0,Very satisfied with these insoles
5.0,Very pleased with these. I've purchased 3 pairs because they work so well for me. I have flat feet and these really help.
3.0,For running shoes I wish I had tried the Originals. The Pinnacles are a little WIDE.
5.0,"Perfect fit for my shoes and no weird feeling or movement like plain heel inserts. A little pricy, but worth it for foot health. Good arch support. Might buy some more."
2.0,"I am giving 2 stars, because the top layer of the insole is already peeling off after couple of days use. Disappointed with the quality."
1.0,"These are a 12.  I assumed when it said 12/13, that it meant it would come as a 13 and you could cut an inch off if you needed a 12.  Nope, they are an inch short in my boots.  One of my boots, I can't feel the edge, the other I can't.  So far they seem pretty comfortable, but it's only been a week.  I will update after a month.

UPDATE:  I have had these in my boots for one week and the fabric on the top is coming off.  I will be requesting a refund."
5.0,Nice support!
4.0,Pretty good for just picking them online.  Nice support & comfortable.
5.0,Great ! my feet likes them !
5.0,These inserts make all my shoes more comfortable and provide relief to my feet.
5.0,"I have used this brand before, it is the same but 100 $ cheaper."
5.0,"I deal with plantar fasciitis that my doctor said was slightly unusual (closer to the heel than most people experience it).  These insoles are the only ones I've found that take the pressure off the problem area.  If these ever change or become unavailable, I don't know what I'll do..."
3.0,"These seem to be of good quality but I cant use them in my shoes The heel is so high, my shoe heel won't stay on."
4.0,"These are softer than the Green Superfeet that I normally use, but they feel really good!  I put in many miles training for marathons, so I'm constantly looking for different insoles to try out.  So far so good with these and I like the price!!"
4.0,"I've used these before and they do the job; had to cut it down to size which is a bit difficult, but these are indeed orthodics.  Length was perfect."
5.0,These really helped me when I had plantar faceitis several years ago. I am a nurse and on my feet a lot while at work. I would recommend.
5.0,Being pregnant these have helped a lot with comfort since I'm on my feet all day at work.
5.0,Seem to be fine.
5.0,better than any other. corrected my plantar fasciitis after many other orthotics failed.
5.0,"More cushioning than the Original version, these orthotics help keep knee and ankle pain at bay for my whole family (3 teenage runners).  I found these while trying to avoid $600 custom orthotics in a podiatry office.  I have experienced plantar fasciitis for many years and these (well I use the ProTech Control variety) have helped tremendously.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"So far these insoles have really relieved my aching feet: heel, arch and ball of my foot."
5.0,"Outstanding insole. Excellent support, wonderful padding, perfect total foot comfort. Also great price!"
5.0,Worked very well for me. I have a high arch and other foot problems. These worked better than my $500. custom Orthotics. Now I haven't taken any 10 mile hikes so this review is my first impression having only walked a couple of miles.
5.0,"So far these are great for my plantar fasciitis, among other foot concerns!"
5.0,Great. My foot quit hurtin as soon as i started wearing
4.0,"So far so good. I have been using them for about 2 weeks now and my feet feel great. I have plantar fasciitis and a heal spur to boot so foot pain is a constant for me. These orthotics  seem to work well in my New Balance 608v4's and have really reduced the pain. They take a few days for your feet to acclimate, but after that your feet will thank you.

PRO:
I wear a New Balance 12EEEE and they fit just right.
Decent padding
Good price
Helps reduce pain from plantar fasciitis
My orthopedic doctor likes them

Cons:
Needs a bit more padding. I am a large person and padding helps."
5.0,Works great.  Very happy with purchase.
5.0,So far so good! I was experiencing pain in my left heel that made me limp for a few days after a hike. These insoles seem to reinforce my feet which is what I needed to keep the discomfort to a minimum.
2.0,"I was hoping these would be thicker (like the PowerStep Pulse). They are too thin, and not much better than the kind you get at a retail store."
5.0,"Oh, I could sing the praises of powerstep, but all I have to say is this: my 4-year suffering from plantar fasciitis has come to an end due to the religious use of these great insoles in all my shoes - including slippers. If there was a way to wear them in the shower, I would. I never and I mean NEVER walk barefoot anywhere, not even to make coffee in the morning. Wal-Mart sells some nice. cheap shoes called ANDI I use for kicking around the house or yard, and I have put powersteps in all my shoes. I hope you will try these if you suffer like I did, you know what an awful thing it is to have barking dogs. I'm back to walking 3-4 miles every day, thank Jah!"
5.0,Work pretty well
4.0,The support these insoles give me is superior to any other insoles I have tried in the past. I think I will buy another pair.
5.0,Fit normal width shoes perfect.  Noticed a difference in the morning after the first day of use. Very satisfied.
4.0,Good product.
4.0,Overall these work well - I inserted them into my shoes and then just had to loosen my laces a bit b/c they take up space in the shoe.
5.0,Great product.  I can't believe how much relief these give my feet and lower back.  Love them.
5.0,great price on a product that was as advertised.
5.0,Great foot arch and foot support.
4.0,"For me, there is not enough support on the ball of the foot and I think the arch may be a little high. But with these products, without going to a professional to have it custom fit, it isn't fair on the company I feel, thats why I gave 4 stars/it is a quality product"
5.0,The best made orthotics
5.0,Very comfortable !!!
5.0,"Perfect fit,very comfortable and did not need to trim them............."
4.0,These really helped with my plantar fascitis. I need a new pair because I have worn these out. They could be a bit thinner for certain shoes like nike etc but overall they fit in just about all my shoes including my duty boots that I'm in 80% of the time. Will order another pair soon.
4.0,Great insoles.
5.0,These inserts really help with my planter  fasciitis. The blue seem to be a little narrower then the pink. The inserts already in your shoes need to be removed before putting these in. I get a new pair when I get new shoes.
1.0,"Very comfortable to wear in any kind of shoes. My feet are never in pain any more. Reason for a bad review is after just a month and a half the plastic support under the padding is falling apart. It is too the point now where piece are actually breaking off and stabbing my foot randomly at work, so even during some of the busiest times I'll have to stop, take off my shoe, find and remove the broken piece, and get back to it. Working restaurant, this is very inconvenient."
5.0,"My new running shoes had a thin/hard removable insole that I found very uncomfortable. I was going to return the shoes; but I thought I would try these Powerstep Pinnacle insoles.

These new insoles are much softer than the thin, hard-as-a-rock insoles that came with this shoe. (But not too soft).

Anyway, now these shoes are now much more comfortable, due to the Powerstep Pinnacle insoles."
5.0,perfect fit and feel great
5.0,"It is very soft and comfortable for walking (4 - 5 miles) and good heel support. Fitting perfectly in my athletic shoe.
I will buy it again for the other shoes."
2.0,"Far too hard, I thought these were well cushioned, instead their built for athletics or what not."
5.0,"Nice arch supports. My physical therapist recommended these arch supporting insoles to help heal up my injured ankle faster. Slipped the old flat insoles out of my shoes and slipped these in. These have a lot of arch support, which my feet aren't used to. I may end up ordering the Powerstep ""Originals"", which have less arch on them. (The Powerstep website lists all sorts of their orthotic insoles. Some with more arch, more cushion, for ball of foot pain, memory foam 3/4 length, wide feet, slender fit, and more.)"
1.0,"The description states Power Pinnacle Orthotics fits into any shoe. I purchased these to fit into my size 12 dress shoe. The product is 1/4 inch too wide in multiple areas. According to Amazon, I can NOT return it for an exchange or refund. I am now out $22.00 due to incorrect size description by Pwerstep Pinnacle Orthotics."
4.0,"Pretty good insoles, has strong support but doesn't compare to true support from truly properly aligning orthopedic insoles. My podiatrist uncle recommended a different brand and after I compared them, went with the other brand. Will probably give these to my friend who needs to start getting used to shoe supports. They're alright, but there's just better ones out there."
5.0,Very pleased with my Powerstep Pinnacle orthotics.  These were recommended by my podiatrist and are the best insoles at an affordable price.  I have bought these more than once. I recommend to those with plantar fasciitis.
5.0,I love them and they are so comfortable!!!
5.0,Very comfortable recommend them
4.0,"I have not had them long enough to decide if they will help Plantar Fasciitis, but I am hopeful that they will help."
5.0,Gives me the needed arch support in my sneakers.  Great service.  Great product.
3.0,"Comfortable but it should be odor resistant , after just few times using them thay start smelling bad"
5.0,Feel amazing on your feet. Can stand in a warehouse for 12 hours with no pain. Very size specific though. Make sure you get the right size you need for that certain shoe.
3.0,"I bought these for a size 11.5 in women's.  They were so short that my toes were hanging off the end.  While I can't argue with the support, I am disappointed with the length.  They would be awesome if they were true to size."
5.0,"I have used them for several years now.  I was just ordering more, they last a long time but, apparently not forever."
5.0,"These are awesome, in some cases better than my custom ones."
4.0,I really do like the powerstep insoles but I really don't see a difference between them and the Quickstrides that I get from my Podiatrist except that I have to pay more for these because they are not covered by my insurance. If you don't have insurance definitely buy these over the Quickstrides as without insurance they are much more affordable and are just as supportive.
5.0,"They fitted as expected. I always a half size smaller than my shoe size so they fit perfectly. Also, they really last a long time."
5.0,"Help with my shin pains. Thick at the arch, but thin at the toes so they don't get crowded. I use them in my running shoes."
5.0,very happy
5.0,WORKED AS EXPECTED
5.0,nice!!
5.0,They are just fine .My husband didn't have any problems adjusting to these orthotics. Working really well .
5.0,They fit fine and feel very good. I have purchased these before.
5.0,Saved me from a lot of pain. Plantar Faciitis had me hobbled. Dr. recommended these and I've been pain free ever since. You have to wear them around the house also for them to be effective so buy a couple pair.
4.0,This insert is really nice.  It fits well and is very comfortable.
5.0,Better than my $150 pair.
5.0,These fit perfectly and have a nice cushion to them as well as the arch support I need. I'll be buying these again!
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect ordering these online without trying them on but they immediately eliminated pain in my left foot. I was having arch pain, metatarsalgia across the ball of my foot in the second and third metatarsal. Also pain in the big toe which was broken a couple years ago and gets stiff and achy. I have had trouble since then with any distance walking. I have the inserts in a pair of Merrell hiking shoes. They fit perfect at size 10-10 1/2. The arch of the inserts seems a little aggressive when I first put the shoes on in the morning but after 15 minutes, my arch seems to adjust and the inserts help distribute my weight evenly across the foot. By midday, I don't even notice it. These inserts are an answer to the problem I was having with pain. I am able to walk miles again with almost no discomfort and no pain where before I was hurting just walking around the grocery store. Well worth the money for me."
5.0,Great for any shoe
5.0,"Fit great, gave instant relief from planters facilities"
5.0,Fits and works as advertised. Immediately felt a difference in my heal and arches.
5.0,They are very comfortable
1.0,Terrible they push up tomuch on the bottom of my feet.bits going to be a bad week until I find another pair.
5.0,They are so very comfortable and I walk on a concrete floor all day with them!
5.0,I have been wearing these for years.  They were originally recommended to me by my Podiatrist.
5.0,"I can destroy shoes and insoles in a matter of just a few days. I work from 3am to 8pm almost every day, standing and walking.
This is the best set of insoles I have found. (And I have tried lots of them). My only wish is that they would last longer. As I am
typing this I am ordering the third set. Good news is that they still last longer than any of the others."
2.0,These are not working for me! I ordered these as advised by my podiatrist they hurt my feet more with them on just not worth the unbelievable chronic pain they're causing!!
3.0,"I tried both the Powerstep Pinnacle and Powerstep Original insoles in my new hiking shoes.  In the end, the Original version proved more comfortable and compliant for my needs."
5.0,Love these!  My first pair came from my podiatrist. The support they provide is great!  I wear them in my slippers.
5.0,"Excellent customer service. Arrived really fast. Perfect, needed for work. Appreciate it."
4.0,"They were exact size and have good support. Not earth shattering comfort, but definite improvement over stock inserts. They do help my heal pain."
5.0,Excellent product and great service!
5.0,"For the money these are quite a good item, great support"
5.0,Feel great
1.0,Junk. Fell apart after two months of use!
5.0,Feels good.
5.0,happy
5.0,cured me! thank you!
3.0,"The insoles themselves are nice. They have good support and are a good quality... for someone with higher arches. However, they just don't work with my low arches and actually cause more pain in my feet than when I wear my tennis shoes alone. Sadly, I'll have to return them and keep searching."
5.0,"I have been fighting with plantar fasciitis for over a year.  Ive been doing the stretching, wearing compression socks and using the night splint, and have made some progress, but not nearly enough.  I finally added these inserts and they seems to have made a big difference. After two weeks of using these, along with good stability shoes, and a compression sock, I think Im actually on the way to becoming pain free."
5.0,"I put at least 60 hiking miles/a week on my Merril boots.  Killed their liner after about 8 mos and they did not have a replacement when I wanted it.  Took a chance on these and they are slightly better than the stock insole for those boots.  Looking a bit worn already, so not sure they are going to go the distance - maybe about the same as stock."
5.0,Works to fix my plantar fasciitis. These last about 6 months and then you should change them out or the problem will return. Over all I have used these many times and I am very happy with them.
4.0,"So far so good! I'm a little bit of a pronator and these guys feel pretty good in the boots I have them in, good amount of arch support- just enough without creating ache in the arch."
5.0,I have used Powerstep for years.  The Pinnacles have more cushion than the originals I started with in the late 1990's and continue the great tradition of excellent support for my feet.
5.0,awesome
5.0,"Love, love these. I have been using SuperFeet for a long time, but these Powerstep's are actually more comfortable and are less than half the price. This model has some cushioning as well as the support which helps my knees to not be as sore after playing tennis which is what I was looking for.  I wear a  women's 10-10.5 tennis court shoe (depending on brand) and these orthotics fit right inside without any trimming. I have purchased 2 pair now in 3 months as for the price I can afford to have them in multiple shoes rather than having to switch them out. Do not know how long they will last as the first pair is just 3 months old but so far so good!"
5.0,This a repeat purchase; I've been using these for about 10 years and put them in each new pair of shoes that I purchase. Very effective!
3.0,"They were great while they lasted.  A lot of the other insoles are jelly soft.  These are nice and sturdy without being hard or uncomfortable.  Its like an airbed versus a firm mattress.

After about 6 months, though, small holes started forming in places where I applied the most pressure when I walk, which gradually got bigger, making them uncomfortable.  Mind you, I don't wear those shoes every day either.  I'd estimate that they'd last 2-3 months of daily use.

I liked my time with them, but they didn't last nearly long enough for me to get a second pair."
5.0,"Good price, right fit. These are great! Improved comfort when walking even for long distances."
5.0,they work fine
5.0,"I have high arches.
These are perfect, the price and fit!!!"
5.0,"Great inserts! Makes any shoe with a rounded toe very comfortable and supportive. I use them over a heel rise for leg length deficiency, and they have really helped restore my arch. My chiropractor gave me my first pair, and I will continue to purchase them for as long as they are available."
5.0,Bought 3 pair for my walking shoes and daily work shoes.
2.0,Covering fell off after 6 weeks and the rest completely broke in half after 3 months. Not impressed. Comfortable at first.
5.0,Very comfortable and just the job for fallen arches or plantar fasciitis
5.0,I need an arch support in my shoes.  These support very well and are comfortable.
5.0,"This is our third pair purchased.  Not so much as they wear out, but because my husband has more than one pair of shoes for the insoles.  It makes a huge difference in supporting his sore feet."
5.0,"these work great to replace those ""less than adequate"" insoles which come in sneakers"
4.0,"Nice size, and comfortable.  Unfortunately they haven't yet cured my heel pain from plantar fasciitis.  But maybe I was hoping for too much!"
5.0,"These were recommended by my podiatrist for a foot problem I have. Arrived promptly and were the same thing I always order, just a bit less expensive!"
5.0,Perfect. I bought these for my sister and she loves them. We both use this brand and they help relieve foot pain very well.
1.0,Waste of money.
3.0,I had to alter the left insole a bit.
5.0,It took a few days to get use to it but now  they feel good
4.0,They are good but they're pretty wide for me.
1.0,"I am sure they would be great, but they are nit true to size.  They do not fit in every shoe and that is what the podiatrist told me.  Very disaapointed because the Dr said they woukd work best."
5.0,Great job
4.0,Good support.
5.0,My wife trimmed these for her shoes in just a cuple of areas to fit. She likes the feeling of the support.
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"My left heel started to hurt when walking due to, I assume, a recent vacation where we walked about 17,000 steps (Fitbit) per day for 4 days. The internet told me I needed arch supports for my shoes. I got these and my pain went away. Highly recommended!"
5.0,excellent product - very happy - good arch support
5.0,"great product
my foot pain i's 80% better"
5.0,I spend a lot of time standing and walking. I suffer from fallen arches. These inserts are excelent.
5.0,"Have 3 pair now, wear them in Cross Fit Metcon shoes, daily tennis shoes, & spare indoor workout shoes.  Huge help on my plantar fasciitis, they add the help needed when I don't have my custom orthotics."
5.0,"Great replacement insole for most styles of shoes.  Really helped with my plantar fasciitis. This purchase was for my 2nd and 3rd pair, so I didn't have to swap them from shoe to shoe so often."
4.0,it's very supportive. if the pads a little thicker should be perfected
4.0,Bought these for my husband and he loves them so far.
5.0,They fit perfectly and so comfortable my last pair lasted 5+ years
5.0,"I've only had them for about a week, but it seems to have helped with heel pain and general foot comfort."
5.0,Only worn them twice but seem to provide good support
4.0,Not quite as sturdy as the new balance inserts but more comfortable support that works well.
5.0,Helped relieve my plantar fasciitis in less than a week. I stand on concrete for 12 hrs a day and is great in my work shoes.
4.0,Love them thank you
5.0,"Perfect fit and what sets them apart from other similar products is the excellent arch support.  Most have some, albeit, minimal support.  These truly have a good arch support.  I highly recommend them."
5.0,Fits well and hoping it helps
5.0,Perfect fit with plenty of support.
5.0,Used these for a long time.  I will continue to reorder them as time goes on.
5.0,"These fit perfectly in my Asics, I didn't even have to trim them at all. Good arch support, my doctor recommended these to me after I fractured my one of my sesamoid bones. Have been using these for about a year, but my doctor did say to replace them after 3 months."
5.0,Relieved my plantar facsitis and are wearing well
5.0,Superb for foot relief from bunions and plantar warts - immediately noticeable difference.
5.0,Love this product every time I pick up a new pair of shoes I pick up a pair of these.
2.0,After wearing this for a week! Wouldn't buy again better to get custom insole made if you can afford it..
5.0,"Great product, I've used them for years. Really supports my foot and eliminates my toe pain."
5.0,must have for heel pain!
2.0,"Great soles as far as comfort goes, however, after two months of ~5 times per week use at my office job the top layer of fabric has already come halfway off on one side and about two inches off on the other. Makes them very uncomfortable unless the fabric is where it's supposed to be. Note, I didn't even trim the edges of the sole to make them fit in my shoe so there's no reason they should have peeled away so fast. I may have gotten a badly glued pair, but I don't see how these could be considered athletic soles if they don't last at an office job with minor amounts of walking."
5.0,Arrived early... was very pleased with insoles!! I would highly recommend!
5.0,"My wife loves it,  she used this product long time ago."
5.0,Best insole that I have tried to relieve plantar fasciitis.  Fit into my shoes without issue.
5.0,This made all my wildest dreams come true.
5.0,Just what I needed for my fallen arches. No more pain in the pads of my feet since the weight has been lifted off them.
5.0,i love it
5.0,Great product
5.0,Have used these for years.  Very good product.
5.0,I walk 10-16 miles a day every day. I tried many things to absorb the pounding. This is truly the best thing i have found and i no longer get heel discomfort after an especially hard long fast walk. Loved it so much i have 8 pairs for all my running shoes. And convinced my wife to buy one.
5.0,i like these insoles so far. ii use them everyday in my work boots that i typically walk on average of 7500 + steps a day and make my boots a heck of a lot more comfortable then they are from the factory. We went from being able to wear any shoes to work boots even though i don't need boots for my job like the men/women that work for me but ive went from wearing walking/running shoes to my boots with these insoles and i have to say i will take my heavy boots with these in them over all the top running shoes i have.
5.0,Very happy with these insoles.  Since they are the full length of the shoe they don't slide around like other types.  They are very durable too.  I've been using these for several years.
5.0,"Was having horrible heel pain from plantar fasciitis and the doctor told me to try these before the expensive custom orthotics.  Took an anti-inflammatory for first couple months as well, but, once the pain was under control, I don't go anywhere without these in my shoes.  I buy a set for every pair of shoes I own."
5.0,Great fit. Makes foot pain disappear.
5.0,Exactly like the ones from the podiatrist at a $10 discount.
5.0,"They work great, but no 1/2 sizes. my toe tips go just past the ends on the 8s (I wear an 8.5).  They are comfortable and work perfectly, tho."
5.0,So far so good. I normally wear the moldable insoles from red wing that cost 3 times as much and I personally think these are just as good or even a little better!
5.0,"A Great pair of orthotics, fit great and feel great."
5.0,perfect fit and very comfortable.
4.0,Helped back down plantar  fasciitis from coming back into my life again. Life savers! Also it's total BS that they sell them in pink for more money...smdh. Skip the pink tax ladies the blue is exactly the same!
5.0,Great fit wear them every day.
5.0,This is my second set of these particular inserts.  I like them and trust them to compensate for my pronated ankles.
4.0,These fit great! Hoping they help with my Planar Fascitis! My feet feel much better at the end of the day after wearing my them.
5.0,"Great product, great price, great service!  Very happy!
Will purchase again for sure and recommend to others."
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,Love them Will be ordering again
5.0,"I own a pair of betterform inserts that I put in my new balance trail shoes.  They work well.  I decided to buy a different pair of inserts for my Timberland casual shoes.  The only difference I can spot is the color of the insert and the signage.  The powersteps have a lower price point.  My Timberlands have a flexible outer and the shoe manufacturers insert comes out so the powerstep inserts were a no brainer.

Just take out the shoe manufacturers insert and place the powerstep inserts in their place.  It takes about a month for your body to adjust to the inserts."
4.0,"I have been using these orthotics for several years,  definately a great purchase"
3.0,Cheap fabric and bad sewing
5.0,"These are amazing, was having major arch pain and this completely fixed it"
5.0,"Once you find a good insole you never go back! We had tried brand after brand trying to find the right insole for my wife, this was the 8th I believe and we have gone through 5 pairs now. She works on her feet a lot so good insoles are a must. These seem to hold up 9 to 12 months before we decide it's time for new ones."
5.0,"I have flat-feet, and need lots of cushioning.  Purchased the Original, Journey Hiker, and the Wide Fit prior to trying the Pinnacle.  All have the same level of arch-support, and the first three have the same amount of cushioning.  The Pinnacles have the most cushioning, feel the best for all-day standing or day-hikes.  Pinnacles are the only Powerstep I buy now!"
5.0,"I carefully read the review before I bought these. I have flat feet and my left foot has become increasingly painful with any shoe I wore. When these insoles arrived, I immediately put them to the test and placed them into the sneakers I wear for Zumba class. During class, my feet did not hurt (like they usually would without these insoles) and they really offer support for my bad left arch. Now, I wear them all the time for my class. If you have flat feet, try these out. They really helped me."
5.0,"Recently diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. Slightly painful when first used, they quickly become comfortable and have helped my condition immensely."
5.0,great insole! really helps my flat feet and plantar fasciitis issues. This is my second pair.
5.0,They work as well as any orthotic made at doctors office.
5.0,I am on my feet all day. Helped keep my feet pain -free.
3.0,3 stares for the right size and quick delivery.after wearing it 2 times I did not see much difference I still have the pain in my feet.i had to work barefoot actually today maybe it will take time so I will update review if I see noticeable change
3.0,"they did not work for me. the padding in the hell to arch hurt my feet badly. it is not the insole I guess it my foot and the way my foot is made it would have been great if the heel padding to the arch was not in it , but it a constant pressure on my underfoot heel. hurts me badly. not happy but it is my foot not the insole. I guess have to get a insole from a doctor and have it made to my foot .  sorry but it was my fault not the insole. just not good for me."
5.0,"These inserts are perfect for my high arch, wide feet... I lead an exercise class on a concrete subfloor... great cushioning"
5.0,Plantar acitius beware!  Thse insoles work great and have significantly reduced  my pain.
5.0,"Love them! I have a pair of Vionics that are twice the price and these are better! I work 10hr shifts half sitting, half walking or standing. I have bunions and the great arch support relieves the pain! So pleased!"
5.0,These are the best orthotics I have found for my plantar fasciatis.  They have good arch support without being painful to get used to.
5.0,Like walking on air
2.0,This fit well and felt great. After 4 shifts at work they started to fall apart. After less than a month they are basically in pieces.
1.0,"They are comfortable, were correct size and worked great except I have had for a little over a month and they are falling apart.  The blue top is coming off the foam and hard plastic part.  I am trying another brand now.  For the price they should last longer than a month.

Update - It is like they do not glue the edges enough.  The new pair I bought a month after these look brand new still.  Wear same amount of time.  I purchased the Spenco Total Support.  So far those have worked great.  Tried to contact Powerstep and never heard back from them."
5.0,Love these. I am slightly larger runner with medium arches who needs a bit of support on my runs. I fell in love with these after my first run. Zero foot pain/soreness which I would usually experience after longer runs. It's really great. I've tried another well-known brand that is often recommended on the interwebs and found that these are much better for my feet. The other insoles are less forgiving and make my feet hurt. These don't at all. Your miles and feet may vary.
4.0,"Helps with my heel pain. The arch seems to be to far toward toes though. All these shoe inserts are crazy expensive. I bought these because they were cheaper than most, I'm satisfied so far."
5.0,I've worn these inserts for years and love them.
5.0,Great insoles.
4.0,"Good but I liked the Nazaroo better, and pinnacle 2nd best. The standard power steps aren't good enough."
5.0,Comfortable and flexible for daily wear. I'm thinking of buying more pairs for my other shoes!
5.0,"love orthotics!  i need all the help i can get- i stand all day on my feet!  these help with the posture of my whole body-  and my feet have minimal pain now.  love, love, love these!  excellent quality!  very sturdy- but not too hard.  LOVE!!  : )"
5.0,Instant pain relief in my work boots i have will be buying again when needed
5.0,Great product.  Great price.
4.0,Bought these for my girlfriend and they work great for strengthening your foot.
5.0,They were a little uncomfortable at first due to the high arch but after my feet got used to them I have much less back pain and lower leg pain.  I'd definitely reccomend them!!
5.0,works well
5.0,Helped me tolerate my plantar fasciitis. Ordered two more pair for my other shoes.
5.0,Change my life. My feet ached after working an 8 hour/ sometime 16 hour shift in my bates boots. I put these in my boots the first day and i tell you HEAVEN. Im walking with ease. Buy this product.
5.0,Since I have been using the inserts I have had less pain when walking distances
4.0,"I purchased these to put in my Georgia work boots as where hurting my feet . After a week of use my feet feel much  better but I was expecting it to work miracles but no chance ,def feel better though.if you had normal  pair of shoes and not work boys these woud prob feel a lot better ."
4.0,Using this gives me much relief in heel pain.
5.0,"These saved my vacation!  On day one, the Teva sandals that were supposed to ""walk me through Europe for weeks"" gave me blisters on the bottoms of both of my feet.  I bought these for my 10 year old Converse shoes to use occasionally.  I landed up wearing the rest of my vacation and had no more problems.  Mind you I walked five to ten miles a day.  Thank you Powestep!!!"
4.0,Great product
5.0,A good product...I have them in all my shoes.
5.0,Had a pair pur hased at Fleet feet store and loves them. These arrived and are exactly the same which is what I wanted. Very happy with them. Soft cushy and arch support.
5.0,These have helped me a lot. I have purchased 3 pairs and have them in all of my shoes
1.0,Doesn't work for me.
5.0,"Have been using these fir years, love them, cured my planta fasciitis"
5.0,"does what it should, fits as it should.  what more can you ask?"
5.0,Great product. Have used this is my third pair.
5.0,Love them!  It helped my plantar fasciitis!
5.0,Only had these a couple days but have been really impressed. Will likely recommend to friends and family. Bought them for men's Clark's Desert Boots and they fit perfectly.
4.0,These are my second set and have made a BIG difference for me. I move them from shoe to shoe or sneaker; I would recommend them to anyone interested in good arch support before buying high end ones.
5.0,Great for Plantar Fasciitis pain relief.  Highly recommend
5.0,"Worked better for plantar fasciitis, than custom orthotics."
5.0,This is what the foot doctor recommended.  This is my second set.
5.0,Sweet sweet sweet love them big difference being on my feet walking all day long at work and help with my sore feet when I work 14 hour shifts love them!!!
5.0,Great fit.  Great feel.
5.0,recommended by my ortho doc
5.0,Worked well.  I bought two more pair so I didn't have to switch shoes
5.0,always a perfect purchase!
5.0,use them every day
5.0,"Great Item, I will be it buying again!"
5.0,"My doctor recommended these insets for plantar fasciitis. So far, so good "
5.0,excellent
5.0,Great supports use them all the time
5.0,So far much like
5.0,Very nice real comfortable
5.0,Have these in ALL of my shoes.  Podiatrist had me get them when I had plantar fascitis.  Haven't had it ever again since using these.
5.0,Such an awesome product. I was dealing with plantar fasciitis and these helped me with the pain. I no longer have heel pain thanks to these inserts and another pair of half inserts I bought.
5.0,Better then the $500 pair from my podiatrist office.
1.0,"I got these things on July 29th. It's currently August 8th, not even two weeks later, and their completely flattened. It's ridiculous. I've used them maybe five times, and I'm not heavy enough for this level of flattening to be reasonable. I mean, I purchased a pair of insoles from Sports Authority for $15 and they lasted me over a year. They never flattened, I lost while moving and was looking for a replacement. Suffice to say these things were not a suitable replacement. Do not recommend."
5.0,"works great, fit was spot on, supports my high arch"
5.0,"I have worn custom orthotic inserts for over 20 years, following cases of plantar fasciitis in both heels that almost necessitated surgery.  The various inserts I've owned were always custom-made by the podiatrist and cost hundreds of dollars per pair.  After reading the reviews for the Powerstep orthotics, I ordered them as an experiment to see how they would feel vs the custom-made ones.  I was honestly astonished.

They are much more comfortable than the custom ones costing at least 10 times as much as the Powersteps.  The entire length of the insole is well-padded, providing a stable and exceedingly comfortable walking experience from the heel all the way through the instep area.  These are an excellent value and well worth purchasing if you have any of the foot conditions that normally can be relieved by the use of orthotic inserts."
5.0,They r great wish I had them earlier then now
5.0,"Perfect support for my arch. I would highly recommend this sole to anyone who's planing to replace their rotting show sole. You won't be disappointed.

5.0,Very good one ! I would say the bezt of all !
2.0,"The length was right but by the time I stuffed these into the Merrells, I could barely get my foot into the shoe. The heel and arch are too thick for me."
4.0,Very good insert for the price
5.0,Fit perfectly and no pain after putting in tennis shoes.
5.0,no back or knee pain with these inserted
5.0,OKAY
5.0,Fits as expected and enhances comfort.
5.0,"Very good inserts ,way better than store bought ones."
1.0,"After not being satisfied with drug store insoles (Dr Scholl's and etc.) I figured I'd pay a little more for better quality insoles with a little more customized fit for my feet and I noticed absolutely zero difference between these and $15 ""massaging"" insoles. I've been wearing now for five days and am completely disappointed. The quality is there but I cannot recommend these."
5.0,my plantar problems are gone..I am amazed..wish they fit in sandals...I am ordering more today for all my shoes!
4.0,Great item.
5.0,Very good product.  Has helped with my problem.
5.0,"A much better deal than the so called ""Expert Store"" or even the Doctors office and works just a good."
5.0,"For my heel spurs, these worked even better than the high priced Dr S... CF440 which cost me $50. For 60% less cost these give me comfort for the whole foot and my heel spurs are just a memory. These feel so good I will wear them all the time whether I need them or not. Of course, each case is different but these are the perfect solution for me."
5.0,I love them.
5.0,Feels great. Know they are very good because they fixed my spouse's feet.
5.0,Great insoles 
5.0,Great shoe inserts for people with high arches
3.0,they hurt my feet when walking
5.0,I've tried cheaper inserts. These are the most comfortable.
1.0,I'm pretty sure these other people were paid for their reviews.  These insoles are a joke.
5.0,I love these arch supports. I have been wearing them for over 9 years. I wear them everyday.
5.0,Made the world of difference in my gait!
5.0,I have plantar fasciitis and these were recommended by my orthopedic doctor. I have several pair and have walked many miles on the first pair and I still have good support.
5.0,Love them!
3.0,there like custom ones but could use more of a cushion
5.0,"I ALWAYS REPLACE LINERS WHEN I GET A NEW PAIR OF SHOES WITH POWERSTEPS AND ALSO REPLACE THE USED PAIR WHEN I FEEL THAT MY FEET NEED NEW ORTHOTICS, YOU CAN TELL."
2.0,I wear size 9.5 shoes and these are too small for my shoes. Both my toe and heel do not fit correctly making the sole quite uncomfortable
5.0,Best Insole I had.
5.0,"Recommended by my podiatrist, works as expected, ordered a second pair."
4.0,Made a difference in what used to be very uncomfortable shoes. I can now use these pair of shoes with no problems.
5.0,this product has been a lifesaver
5.0,Best fit and feel I have ever had!
4.0,nice fit I am very flat footed seem to be working well
5.0,"Good product, good fit."
5.0,They fit my tennis shoes perfectly and are very comfortable. You can't even tell they are in the shoes. I bought them because of a tendon issue in one foot. They have already helped the condition.
5.0,Every bit as good as superfeet and probably even better. And a better value. I'm a convert!
5.0,"Wear them daily, very comfortable and fit well in my shoes."
5.0,Just the same as they always are.
3.0,Worked great! For like 2 months then they started to fall apart already where my old ones sames brand lasted 1.5 years before going bad
5.0,Helps prevent shin splints.  Have a short break-in period.
5.0,Really pleased with them. I needed a size 11. The 11 to 11.5 were a perfect fit. Ordered a set for my wife after getting these.
4.0,Would buy product again for sure
5.0,Really helped with feet pain. Excellent support for work.
5.0,Love them!!!
5.0,Always feel much better after getting new pair.
5.0,"My plantar fasciitis requires more than Dr Sh,,,,S these are high quality I've used for 15 yrs"
5.0,These were recommended by my Doctor. I love them. My very high arches are supported and my heels are cushioned.
5.0,Great support!
5.0,I have 3 pair these are great
4.0,Didnt quite have enough cushion for relief of my plantar fasciist in my left heel. Fit good just isn't a total solution for my problem.
5.0,My husband has been wearing these in his work boots for a couple of years. They are great but you have to watch the price because they can flexuate $10 in a matter of a couple of hours.
4.0,As expected
5.0,These are great insoles!  I went to the podiatrist and he immediately said he was glad to see I was wearing powersteps in my shoes.  My whole leg feels better when I wear these.  The have good arch support.
5.0,I like these
5.0,Nice inserts that provide extra arch support. Fit true to size (14).
5.0,These inserts help with my foot pain from peripheral neuropathy.
5.0,Perfect fit for Planter Fasciitis. Local store wanted $30 for same thing
5.0,"best inside arch support and comfort. change these every 3 months if you're on your feet a lot. I wear mostly MBT shoes as they are THEE best shoes for nurses etc, heavy treading during the day."
5.0,"and feel good. Not too cushion-y, but supportive, as they should be.  Can't speak to the longevity, just got them but I rotate my shoes so I expect them to last."
3.0,Eventually uncomfortable
4.0,"My toes hang off the edge, I wear 13 men's and the heel and arch are working."
5.0,Fit just right
5.0,"Great product. What I like best about these insoles vs the competitors is that it slightly stiff in a good way. When I say slightly stiff, that is because some of those Dr. Sholls are too ""flimsy"" and they will move around a lot inside of your shoes. Like if you curl your toes in your shoes just to test it with a Dr Sholls brand, it curls with them. So you could imagine the sliding around while walking etc.

These have plenty of cushion for comfort, yet the bottom layer is stiff so they don' slide around. I wear these in my everyday work shoes and my feet feel great."
5.0,very comfortable and work well
5.0,"These has been very comfortable and seem to be as good as my prior walking company insoles (which were much more expensive).  So they are great and I have had some serious foot issues.  Good cushioning with good arch support.  Would recommend for plantar fasciitis or heel pain issues.

I didn't have to trim the toe as they fit in my tennis shoes just fine."
5.0,I love these!!!
5.0,"These are great. My feet feel really supported and I feel like walking stability is improved, especially the arch. I just ordered a second pair so I won't have to move them back and forth between shoes as much. They feel really firm when you first try them, and for some reason I expected them to be softer to absorb the impact of walking, but actually after wearing them I think they are just right. Highly recommended!"
5.0,As expected
5.0,Wow.  These are great.  Really supports my arches
5.0,Product has been a big help with my planter fasciitis!
5.0,I replaced my Solomon trail shoe inserts with these and I felt the difference right away. The Solomon inserts were plenty good but for the long haul they keep my feet and legs much more nimble and comfortable. Highly recommended
3.0,My daughter bought these for work as she is on her feet most of the time. I was disappointed that they do not fit into her Skechers non slip shoes.
5.0,"These are by far the BEST shoe inserts available!  When I don't have them, my heel hurts, I have pain in my leg and hip.  It is amazing how much they help!"
5.0,the best I love these especially since I can buy them online
5.0,Fit great and some of my lower back pain has gone away. Have yet to do the stance/strength test since I've used them though.
5.0,These orthopedic inserts are amazing!  They make such a difference.  I had the beginnings of planters fasciitis and the support from these inserts has made such a difference when playing tennis or walking.  I will be ordering a couple additional pairs so I can have a set of inserts for each pair of athletic shoes I own.
5.0,All good.. feet feel good
3.0,For some reason these seem somewhat short in my shoes.
2.0,"I didn't find these inserts helpful. Which was disappointing since I bought them based on the overall good reviews. They didn't help my plantar fasciitis at all, in fact, I noticed I was in a bit more pain after using them, specifically after a workout. They also ran a bit big. I wear a size 10 in woman's shoes, and these were too big. They fit into my gym shoes, but it was a tight squeeze to put the inserts in (yes, after removing the inserts the shoes come with). The inserts didn't fit into any of my day-to-day shoes either - my flats, heels, casual shoes - nope. Disappointing."
5.0,These are replacements for a pair I got from my doctor. Cost was half of what the doctor charged.
5.0,It is good. And you have to take out the existing pad.
5.0,These are just what I was hoping for.  They provide more padding on the ball of my foot. The extra padding is great. I was able to wear them from the first day without any issues.  I am replacing my old orthotics with these.
5.0,Bought these for a new  pair of hiking shoes to help w/ my plantar fasicitis and was extremely impressed!  I mostly wear Danskos shoes but they don't offer a good hiker so this was the next best thing.  I have been wearing these everyday for the last week & have had no pain.  I would definitely recommend!
4.0,Love these insoles.
5.0,"I need deeper shoes for this support because the soles are thicker..after removing the shoe soles. However, the support is Excellent, Firm and lasts longer than other flimsy support soles. It does the job to support my feet."
4.0,good support
4.0,"My husband was able to replace the sole of his work shoe with these and while they are an improvement, they don't do the job he was expecting. However, my parents use this product and they say it works wonderfully for them. Try them out!"
5.0,Make my feet feel wonderful!
5.0,Great support for someone with high arches. Love them and have been using them in my running shoes for many years now.
5.0,"This is my third pair, and love them!!"
5.0,"Have been wearing for under a week in my new running shoes and so far, less pain from plantar fasciitis.  Will see how things go over the long haul."
5.0,I've been using these for a while per recommendation of a podiatrist.  I was just completing for the rest of my shoes.
5.0,fits my shoes good and i can feel a better difference with my plantar fasciitis
3.0,"Will not fit in any of my shoes without taking out the insole it came with.  Taking out the factory insole and putting this one in... not much better than the insole you're taking out.  So, maybe a good replacement for an insole that has worn out... but don't expect to be blown away with comfort or support."
4.0,The same quality as the ones I got at my Podiatrist
5.0,"Great item and fast Shipping, Thanks so much"
4.0,Help me so far!
5.0,Work great!
5.0,Just what I needed to make my shoes as comfortable as they can be.
4.0,"Good product, but not as supportive as I need."
5.0,These are great for helping with both foot and back issues.  They help me walk further and feel better in the mall and on the back country trails as well.  I got a pair for my every day shoes and for my hiking boots.
5.0,I have used this product for years. Nice insert for flexible arch with solid support and all day comfort.
5.0,Great love them my daughter took a summer job as a waitress and they helped her feet.
5.0,Love them! I have several pairs! These have saved my feet! No more plantar fascitis! I actually have an arch in my foot now!! My feet love these soles!
5.0,Really helps the feet if you have plantar fasciitis forming. May take some time getting used to them so do not be discouraged if you can not wear them all day at first.
5.0,I couldn't work... stand all day... without them!!!
4.0,Had gotten these from a shoe store previously.  They are a joy to my feet when walking.  Recommend them if you are looking for a comfortable insert.
5.0,New comfort for me
4.0,Seemed a little wide in hiking boots
5.0,OK
5.0,"My second pair of powersteps. No more plantar fasciitis pain. Were them in my house shoes and work boots and tennis shoes. It's nice to have no pain all day long! Great product at a very fair price. And very durable, 1st pair still going strong almost 2 years later!"
2.0,At first wearing they feel supportive.  After a couple of days there is no difference between wearing these and the original insole that came with the shoes. My husband complained of the same foot pain because of the lack of arch support and cushion.  The material is not strong (rigid) enough to support his weight.  Maybe it would be more effective for someone lighter.  (My husband is not too happy with my comment.)
5.0,These are amazing!
4.0,Great for those of us who stand long periods of time!
5.0,I have been using these insoles for several years.  They are great.  I will definitely by again.
5.0,Great product
4.0,I am hoping these will improve my overpronation issue. I have been wearing these for several weeks and I feel like my feet feel better having these insoles in my shoes.
5.0,"I already had a pair of these and was just replacing them so knew what I was getting. That being said, I like these soles. Had lots of problems with my feet hurting  with everything I wore. These helped with that."
5.0,Good set
5.0,"This is the 4th set that I've gotten. I had a problem with my foot and when I went to the Doctor he recommended a store for me. When I got there, they recommended these inserts. My foot healed up and now I'm hooked on them. All my walking shoes have these. Even my bowling shoes have them.."
5.0,I have plantar fasciitis and power step are better than than the orthotics that I had custom made
5.0,Works for me
2.0,"These insoles were not comfortable, they fit as expected but didn't live up to they hype."
3.0,"Good quality, just not right for my feet as I thought."
5.0,Always buy these
5.0,Very nice  and confy
5.0,I have worn them for years but I was able to buy 2 at Amazon for the price of one at my local shoe store.
4.0,Made a great difference!
5.0,GREAT but too large
5.0,Great insoles with a preformed plastic arch
5.0,Powersteps are great for my feet. Fit well & last. Only inserts I've found that work for me. I have several pairs & styles. All great.
5.0,"I have ordered these multiple times and use them to replace the insoles of all shoes where they will fit.  I have very miserable feet and I over pronate so these make my feet much less miserable and improve hip and back pain by correcting the pronation problem.  If possible, I remove the insoles from the shoes I purchase and add 2-3 Equate Comfort Cushion Insoles (similar to""Dr. Scholls Air Pillo""s)-whatever will fit without making the shoes too tight and then place these over the top.  If you have never worn something with a supportive arch, they may feel uncomfortable at first.  I started with original blue power steps and then moved up to Pinnacle and now I don't want to be without the Pinnacles, ever.  I have tried over 30 different brands of insoles and have a full bag and hundreds of wasted dollars on inserts that didn't help.  These are what work for me.  I can highly recommend Zappos for trying new things because they have a large selection and generous return policy and they pay shipping both ways.  Once you find what works, Amazon provides the affordable option for purchasing more.  I was always forced to buy very expensive athletic shoes that still were not comfortable without these inserts and additional padding, but recently tried the Pinnacles with 3 cushioned pads in some clearance men's shoes from Walmart and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they were and my adult son even complimented the look of the shoes.  The most expensive part of that combo is the inserts (they were more than the shoes and inserts combined).  But the best news is they might just expand your shoe options.  So if you suffer like I do, give them a try and if they don't work try other options until you find something that does."
4.0,Good fit.  Could be a little more cushioning.
5.0,"Very good.
Satisfied."
5.0,eased the pain from a heel spur.
5.0,Great Product
5.0,Fit great.
5.0,Put them in my work boots and haven't looked back!  Fantastic product!
1.0,The blue liner came off after the 2nd day on my left insert. Now the hard plastic in the center is showing. Will have to buy another pair after 20 day or so of use. Not very happy about the purchase.
5.0,"My third pair now. My podiatrist recommended these inserts 2 years ago. I wear them 5 days a week on my job. I work in a grocery store on concrete floors. The inserts help my feet, ankles, knees and lower back stay relatively ache free."
5.0,I tried out the Pinnacle the Superfeet between those two the Pinnacle is better. I couldn't believe the comfort of the Arches support. On the Superfeet it had good comfort but still a little hard on the forefoot I used them in basketball shoes and they seem to be holding up pretty well. They have good cushion I wouldn't say spectacular but they have just enough to where you don't mind wearing them while you play I have been looking for more of a cushiony setup but this Pinnacle really surprise me with how comfortable it was. It was definitely worth the try and out of the two I would pick the Pinnacle over the Superfeet athletic
4.0,they fit fine
1.0,Not even in a box.  Just a baggie. No lnstuctions
5.0,"I was having horrible pain in my heels due to plantar fasciitis and a friend recommended these Powerstep insoles for my shoes.  After 1 weeks, the pain is 100% gone.  I will continue to buy and will highly recommend!"
5.0,So much better than super feet.
4.0,"These insoles fit my Nike shoes perfectly and they are comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that on the left side, it makes the top of my foot uncomfortable, like I have tightened my shoe too tight, so I have loosened the laces as much as I can.. Other than that, I like them and will continue to wear them. They were recommended by my podiatrist."
5.0,"Perfect fit, great support and feel great"
5.0,Excellent Product. This is my 5th pair now! Won't muse anything else.
5.0,Save your money and buy these instead of a more expense pair of insole. They have helped me.
5.0,These have really helped my plantar fasciitis. Feel great and offer good support for my feet.
5.0,"Perfect. I used to buy work shoes every 6 months for my back, now that I use Pinnacles I buy a pair of shoes every +2 years, throw away the factory insoles and replace with Pinnacles every year and in~2 years the shoes are falling apart. I was buying 200.00 Redwings, now I buy 100.00 Timberlands"
5.0,love them!
4.0,Good insoles
5.0,Work great!
5.0,I love these.  I have a high arch and very good cushioning.  I do a lot of hiking and walking.  I have these inserts for all of my shoes now - or at least move them from one pair to another.  The best I have found.
5.0,Best insoles to use for plantar facetious
5.0,very comfortable
4.0,These have significantly reduced my foot/heel pain. Unfortunately the lining came off the right insert after about a week. Otherwise I've been vet happy.
4.0,seems fine
4.0,"After trying a number of different Super Feet insoles, I decided to give the Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics a try. Have to say, these are a bit wider than the Super Feet which has been great for me. I'll definitely order another pair when these wear out."
5.0,I always buy these!
5.0,I've bought them before and I'll buy them again.... Very comfortable..... Great price.
5.0,Finally my feet are in love!  They haven't felt this good in years.  Much better than my specially made orthotics at a fraction of the price.
5.0,I work in a Woodshop as an instructor and spend many hours a day on a concrete floor. Being a little older I've also lost a great deal of the natural cushioning in my feet and the arch which comes with being a younger man. My doctor had prescribed a particular kind of insole which when I Googled it through Amazon this product came up at a much lower price and for the money I thought I would try it. Very happy with the support and my feet feel a lot better too
5.0,Works great in my shoes!
1.0,"Terrible insoles. The ""arch support"" is just the ridged plastic molded into a shape that probably won't fit you. Wore these for a day at work. Tried day two but had to remove the insoles due to the so called support just pushing painfully into the bottom of my foot.

Look elsewhere. This product is made by someone who has no clue about high arches."
5.0,"A little narrow, otherwise perfect fit. Extreme comfort for retail shifts."
5.0,"Fit good in a size 15 shoe.
Would buy again"
4.0,"These insoles are fantastic--at first. I'm a nurse in peri-op, which means I'm on my feet 10 hours a day at a minimum. These insoles provide support and pain relief, but they don't last. Within 3 months, they're all but destroyed--I have pics of the first pair I bought 3 months ago. But the cost is kow enough that I was willong to buy a second pair--not sure of this is planned obsolescence or just the result of my job."
5.0,"I have maybe 3 pairs of these in different shoes. I have flat feet and if I'm on them without them in my shoes, I end up with arch pain and develop posterior tibialis tendonitis. I keep them in my running shoes and hiking boots and have no problems with a break in period."
5.0,"I noticed a difference immediately. Even while at work I noticed my feet weren't hurting like they usually do. My feet do not hurt as much at night now (it was to the point where I couldn't sleep on my back because of the pressure on my heels. I think next time I will buy one half size up, because these do feel just a bit small in my work shoes.

These made me notice that I have not been walking correctly on my right foot, which has probably added to the pain. Working on correction my walking posture with these inserts as a guide.

Does not completely get rid of the ache, but these are the best inserts I've yet to find."
3.0,I'm disappointed that these do NOT offer ANY SUPPORT AT ALL for the front part of the foot.  Dr. Scholl's does just as well.
5.0,"These replaced custom insoles I had made for my running shoes that I had been using in my work boots. These are a great improvement in support and comfort. I wear my work boots around our 10 acres doing all kinds of work chores and since using the insoles, I've had no foot pain and my feet feel much better at the end of the day. I will be buying these again for my other shoes that I wear often and for long periods of time."
3.0,The support is noticeable after the first day but after a couple of days my feet still feel a bit sore after a few hours at my job where I have to stand all the time. But overall it still leaves some comfort for the feet
5.0,"My ""go to"" insert. They last through a few pairs of my running shoes before I have to buy another. I've ordered this several times and have always been happy with it. It's a lot cheaper here than ordering it anywhere else."
5.0,Very good
1.0,"Bought a size 6 (my shoe size, although I wear a 6.5 in some brands) and I need at least a size smaller.  The supports don't fit into flats, sneakers, or heels"
1.0,"Very dissapointed.  These have seen light duty since I purchased the inserts in April 2017, and this review is July 1st, 2017.  Much of the blue fabric on top the inserts has separated from the main body and just balls up.  Additionally, the black foam underneath is breaking down quickly, with the darkest areas being worn through the most, along with some chunks outright missing.  These are now useless to wear, and have created sore spots on my feet.  I've never had an insert fail this quickly, not even the cheap ones that usually come with your shoes.  An expensive waste of money.  See my photos for examples."
5.0,Fit my New Balance shoes perfectly. Just bought my 2nd pair.
3.0,"I have PF and need good cushion, this is ok but not for long days"
5.0,"Excellent product, ordered this for my Nike shoes to get some relief for Plantar Fasciitis. I work at a hospital and am on my feet 12-16 hours a day. It is such a huge difference from the thin insoles that come with regular shoes. My feet felt better when I wore this for 12 hours next day at work. There is an elevation and the soles are quite sturdy to support the weight. This along with compression sleeves is the way to go for any one suffering from Plantar Fasciitis. I plan on using this insoles for all my shoes, will order another pair."
5.0,"These inserts are awesome! My arches are starting to fall causing foot pain when wearing shoes without arch support. I began having foot pain after wearing my work tennis shoes for  about 1 yr. After removing the original  inserts I put these orthotics in my old shoes  and my foot pain was eliminated immediately. It was like having a new pair of shoes only I did not spend another $130 on new shoes. I have been wearing them daily for about 2 months and my feet still feel great.  The difference in these orthotics and less expensive ones in store is the deep heel cup which stabilizes the heel and the fairly rigid arch support. This may not be as comfortable to someone who does not have a flexible arch.
I also bought the 3/4 length for casual shoes and they also work great but do not take up as much room in the shoe. I ordered them for my children who are college students waiting tables for the summer and cannot wear tennis shoes  with good support to work. They love them too!
I have recommended these to everyone I have talked to with similar foot problem."
2.0,no padding too rigid for walking on concrete all day
5.0,perfect
5.0,Wish I found these years ago !!! A Doctor recommended them & WOW !!! My feet are so much better .
5.0,"I've used these type of insoles for several years now, and they fit perfectly.  They last long, and do a great job of making my foot issues so much better, and they're so much cheaper on this site than in my local shoe store."
4.0,"These are great quality and as described. The problem is that they take up a lot of room in your shoes. Even after taking out the pads that comes with my shoes, these are one tight fit. I tried them with various shoes and found a pair that I can actually tolerate the fit for about 2 hours at best-which is fine to exercise. I will say that for the first time in almost a year, I was pain free. It took the weight off of my heel. I just need to buy a 1/2 size larger shoe perhaps so I can actually use these wonderful inserts."
5.0,"These are wonderful! They were recommended by a podiatrist, and they quickly cleared up my plantar fasciitis. I now have three pairs--for my slippers and shoes I wear to work."
5.0,Keeps my feet pain free
5.0,Gone to the dr multiple times for feet pain and they tried to get me to pay $300 for inserts.. my buddy  Recommended these and it was the best route I could have gone. Cheap and my feet feel great in my boots that I wear everyday since I work in law enforcement..feet got a little sore the next day but it was from the correction of the foot. Great buy trust me I'll be ordering more for all my other everyday  shoes as well.
5.0,Love these. They have helped with my heal issues.
5.0,"made a huge difference in his speed and agility on the field.  it was apparent that his feet hurt while on the field; once I inserted the Powerstep Orthotics, he hasn't complained of his his feet hurting because of his cleats or the lack of support that they provided.  Seeing him hunker down and make fabulous plays is priceless!"
5.0,Saved lots of money I bought 3. I can walk again
5.0,"good for me, i like."
5.0,Perfect fit.
5.0,This is my second pair of Powerstep Orthotics. First pair was recommended by my foot doctor. They wear well and last a considerable length of time.
5.0,This is my second pair of these inserts. Good for plantar fasciitis
5.0,have used these for years.  Hold up very well
5.0,I have arthritis and these insoles have been a lifesaver. Highly recommended for those suffering from foot pain.
3.0,The width is fine they are very comfortable  but not a true size 13.  Just a bit short on the toes.
5.0,"My podiatrist gave me a pair after diagnosing my Plantar fasciitis. I was in a lot of pain and didn't know if I'd have to stop running. These really helped, after wasting my money on the Dr, Scholls and other brands (which were useless) I now use them for running and also put a pair in my hiking boots."
5.0,It works
5.0,They provide great support for my sneakers.  They help prevent my feet from hurting.
5.0,Great fit and great foot comfort!!!!! I decided to purchase three fitness pairs and one for my dress shoes.
5.0,Feel good to walk or run on it!
5.0,These orthotics are just what I needed. I ordered another pair.
5.0,Worked Great - Thanks
5.0,Fits like a glove some shoes 9 some 9 1/2 fits both size great
5.0,I have been using the original Powerstep insole and moved to the Pinnacle and they are great.  They were recommended by my podiatrist and have made a big difference in how my feet feel.
5.0,Barely had to trim the toe.  Seem to relieve quite a bit of pain.
3.0,"I probably walk around 6-8 miles a day so was looking for an insert that could give my feet some love.  They look like they would be very comfortable.  But they are so thick that that even in my looser fitting shoes, they take up so much space that my feet are screaming for relief.  At the end of the day, it's more comfortable to wear my shoes without these inserts."
5.0,"I bought the Pinnacle at the suggestion of my physical therapist.  I was concerned that something sized for a size 7  - 7.5, would be too big for my shoes-size 7.  They fit perfectly.  Even my therapist was impressed at how well they fit my shoe and improved my gait."
5.0,My first pair was from a doctor and I sure payed more then I do here.  They fit just like the first pair from the doctor!
5.0,"The absolute BEST insoles for foot pain and plantar fasciitis.  This is the third pair I've bought (so that I don't have to keep moving them from one pair of shoes to another so often). Even my worn out pair (5+ years old) works better than any other brand I have tried.  These insoles literally changed my life, allowing me to walk pain free all day and get out of bed without hobbling the next morning."
4.0,Just started wearing today.  Will revisit when I have better information.
5.0,Great value and fit
5.0,I have a bone spur and P.F. I took the sole outta my Brookes running shoes and inserted these. I can run now without being in pain. Great product!
5.0,"I have two sets and they make my feet NOT hurt. I can actually do some walking, etc.  They're great!!"
2.0,"Not as comfortable as expected. The insole lifts drastically in the arch and has no support under the arch, there is very little cushioning and I cant imagine this insole would align with any foot bed. Definitely not for my daily footwear."
5.0,Works great. Good arch support which took me awhile to get used to. Exact same size as the original insoles in the shoes.
4.0,I have 4 or 5 pair I'm going to get a couple of more......
5.0,Excellent service and size was great.
1.0,"Hello,

I am writing this review because I am thoroughly upset with my product! I used to have a pair of these insoles long before I ordered these that I got from a local store in my town. The product was excellent, it fit well, and I had no problems whatsoever with it. However, when I decided to order them because of the cheaper price. My problems have arised! I received these May 24th and they are already broken!!! The complete fabric from the top layer of the right insoles has completely just decided to detach itself from the insole AND the insole is CRACKED almost all the way through! I need these insoles for my work, as I am on my feet 8 hours or more per day! I am not happy with what I have received."
4.0,I walk all day long every day and my feet still hurt but the inserts make my shoes more comfortable
2.0,didn't fit in my shoes very well. Had to return them!
5.0,Really helps my feet (85 yrs old).
5.0,Love them!  Now the family is wearing them!
5.0,Best insoles you can buy
5.0,They are worth the money
5.0,Solved my problem!
5.0,I used to buy those $300 inserts that my foot Dr. said I needed. Now I buy the Powersteps for all my shoes. I wish I had tried them a lot sooner.
5.0,"I purchased these several years ago when I started running and they've made such a HUGE difference in comfort while running and after.  I have transferred them whenever I've gotten a new pair of running sneakers.  If you often experience pain in feet and shins after running, I would definitely try these."
5.0,perfect support for my walking shoes
4.0,It helped a lot in relieving my pain from plantar fasciitis. I can say 80% of my foot pain was gone while alternately standing and walking while@ work.
1.0,it's not comfy and crammed up my foot
5.0,"Good product but not right fit with my shoes. Tried to cut down, but still don't fit. I'll stick with the Pinnacle Maxx"
5.0,Great insoles
5.0,"Took only about half a day to get use to them.
Ordered two more pair they r the best!"
5.0,This product has made such a difference in my life!! I had suffered with plantar fasciitis for over a year before a podiatrist recommended this product. I got immediate relief once I started using these. I now will not go without them! I am a heavier person so I find that I need to replace mine every 6 months or so but we'll worth not having that terrible pain!
5.0,"I have plantar fasciitis, these work FANTASTIC. been wearing them for a couple years, I'm on my feet all day. don't get sore anymore, other than just tired."
5.0,These are great off the shelf orthotics.  I have dealt with plantar fasciitis for years.  I have had many pairs of custom orthotics but find these work just as well and now choose to buy these instead.
5.0,I work in a hospital and these are outstanding!
5.0,Can't wear shoes without these insoles unless I buy expensive orthopedic type shoes.  So I love these insoles.
5.0,Fits perfectly
4.0,"Great for arch, midfoot, and heel support.  Forefoot lateral motion is not addressed by the engineering of this insole so pick high quality footwear that takes care of the sideways motion."
4.0,what a difference. these are great. very comfortable. wish they were black.
5.0,"Awesome! I am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day,  a great investment."
4.0,It fits well. The only difference that concerns me is my original inserts have a small hard rubber or plastic square on each heel. I am concerned that I didn't get the same insert
5.0,I have Neuropathy and have been using these for years.  Without them I can honestly say that I would not be able to walk or stand as long as I do.
4.0,I should have ordered #5. These were a level 4 support
5.0,"This is my third or fourth pair.  Absolutely necessary for sports, as the insoles in most tennis shoes are horrible.  Also use them in casual ""Boat shoes"" and it makes the shoes fit better.  I had custom orthotics made two years ago for $300, and these ""Powersteps"" works just as well for me.  So I have several of them at this price, and just leave them in my shoes, instead of moving the $300 one from shoe to shoe."
5.0,"Love these inserts. They were recommended to me by a podiatrist and well worth the price.  Continued use  in a sturdy pair of tennis shoes ended my pain from Morton's Neuroma,"
5.0,Muy bien perfectos
1.0,"The blue colored micromesh comes off. Not glued on well at factory. They need to use better glue. Without the micromesh, the sole of your foot can't move around and adjust in the shoe as you walk (I tried).  Very uncomfortable to walk in without the mesh.  Useless at that point."
5.0,Love these they helped my planters fasciitis when nothing else did!
5.0,Great orthotic for plantar issues. Great price too compared to Lyncos brand.
5.0,Made a BIG difference right from the get go!  Pain in my heel was softened and way less pressure on my feet. w Will most likely get more pairs for other shoes!
5.0,Helps a lot
1.0,"I've had several pairs of these over the years, all were good until this pair. Blue fabric completely separated from insole after three days of wearing. I used to always recommend these to friends, never again. They should last longer than three days for the price."
5.0,Awesome.  I've tried many others.  All of the positive reviews are accurate.  I just ordered a second pair.
5.0,These insoles serve their purpose.  They provide the necessary support that to relieve pain caused by plantar fasciitis.
3.0,"They feel fine, but the top layer lining of the insoles (on both feet) came unglued and now I have to unroll them every time I put them on :("
5.0,Excellent insoles. Best over the counter insoles I've purchased. For use in industrial applications I highly recommend them
5.0,Getting some relief with these from plantar fasciitis.  Plan to order another pair.
5.0,"i had my last pair for a year and a half beefore i had to replace them. these are worth getting, and no more foot pain. :)"
5.0,Relief from sore feet / PF.  Saved me from expensive custom orthotics. Recommended.
5.0,Great insoles for active feet. They slide right in with no problems. Feel great on my feet. I am on my feet all day and when I get to go home my feet don't hurt.
5.0,"Excellent
Great fit
Very comfortable"
5.0,"Bought them before and they work great, great price"
5.0,so far so good!  these are giving my work shoes an extra life
4.0,My podiatrist recommended these for me for fallen arches. Seems to work fine and comfortable.
4.0,Already had a pair given by podiatrist and these fit the same way.
5.0,"These work well for me, I got the original at the orthopedist, and although these are slightly different, they work the same for me.  Great buy at a lesser price"
5.0,"After wearing these for a couple weeks in all of my shoes, my plantar fasciitis went away.  I'm glad I didn't spend $500 on custom orthotics!"
5.0,"Fits well, feels good, reasonable cost.  I'll buy more. "
5.0,great insert
5.0,Really makes a big difference in my step! I have a problem of overpronation and these really help correct my stance. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Has really helped my tendonitus! Must not work for everyone but it worked for me. Worth it to try it out anyway. No more pain for me. Might be a little thick for SOME shoes.
5.0,"Exactly the same as I got from my podiatrist, but better price."
1.0,Do not buy these insoles unless you are absolutely sure you will love them because you can not return them and you will lose all your money!!
1.0,They didn't help me.flat footed and having heel spurs at work.
5.0,An orthopedic recommended this very product to a friend of mine. I suffer from plantar fasciitis and wearing these makes a big difference. I have less aches in my feet and legs after being on my feet all day at work with these orthotics.
3.0,"While these insoles fit well in my shoe and offered amazing cushion, their thickness made them unsuitable for anything but lace-up shoes.  I can't wear these with loafers or flats, which is what I bought them for, but they work wonderfully in my sneakers."
5.0,This is the second pair I bought for my husband. He's put them in his work shoes. He runs around more in his work shoes now with these inserts then in tennis shoes.
2.0,"These fit okay for arch support, but did not provide enough cushioning for my heel--plantar fasciitis causes a lot of pain in my heel. I'm on my feet all day as a teacher and these were not my favorite for providing relief from pain."
5.0,The Powerstep inserts have been a dream come true for my feet. I spend 10 to 12 hours a day walking on a concrete plant floor. My left foot has been extremely painful due to an inflamed arch and Achilles tendon. I have had the inserts in my work boots for 5 days and the pain in my left foot is starting to subside. These inserts fit my boots well. Size for size. They provide excellent arch support and very good heel cushioning. If you have aching feet these inserts will help alleviate the pain. Well worth the money.
5.0,Great Worth the price.
5.0,Best orthotic I have ever used since retiring from ankle surgery and osteo arthritus in 2010.  I can walk much further in much less pain.  Get it!
5.0,So far so good. They feel good. And help with lower back pain.
5.0,"So far so good, great addition to my workboots."
5.0,I've used Powerstep orthotics for many years and they are the best.  I would recommend them to everyone.
5.0,"These are perfect!! I have plantar fasciitis, and felt my first relief as soon as I pit them on!!"
4.0,"Fit in my shoes perfectly. Very comfortable.  I stand all day, mostly on a marble floor, and this has helped with the pain in my metatarsal bones."
5.0,5th pair for differnet footware
5.0,"I love these insoles!  My wife uses the same kind and loves them too!  She told me to get some for my boots.
I have a pair of Oak Tree Farm boots that I couldn't wear and I put these insoles in and now they feel like a new pair!  Super comfortable!
I purchased the ""Pinnacle"" style and they matched right up to the size of the boot with no trouble.
When you buy orthotic insoles, spend some money and get the best you can afford. They will wear out over time but the cheap ones wear out sooner.
I am very happy!  When you get older, nothing is worse than sore feet and I can walk around all day with these insoles in my boots!  They work good in walking shoes too!  That's where my wife uses hers.
OhioMo123"
5.0,these insoles are great!
4.0,"Best insert that I've found thus far - relieves much of the pressure on the heel of the foot.  Not quite the final fix that I'll need, though.  I'm still shopping for something that will work even better.  I think they'll be perfect for some, and not quite right for others!  It's worth a try and superior to many others I've tried previously."
5.0,Perfect fit and very comfortable.
5.0,My Husband loves these. He uses them in his athletic shoes and can do more activity without leg pain. He has used this style for several years.
5.0,This is my second pair so I knew which size to order.  My feet appreciate the extra padding thesePowerstep Pinnacle Orthotics provide.  Of course I remove the padding that comes in my sports shoes and replace with these superior ones.
5.0,Powerstep pinnacle insoles are an excellent foot support for those who don't need custom orthotics. The arch support is better than anything you could purchase in a store.
5.0,The Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic Insoles really helped relieve the pain from my Achilles tendonitis.  I have a very high arch in my feet and the insole fit very nicely.  Walking felt much easier.
5.0,This an excellent product that I have used for many years.
4.0,Fit as expected.
4.0,perfect
5.0,"I've had these for less than 24 hours, so I'll post an update if anything changes, but...oh em gee. I feel like no one will believe this is a legitimate review, because I'm about to tell you that the INSTANT I put these on, I began to feel better. Before my foot even hit the floor or I stood up or tried to walk, my foot and ankle felt better. I wore them for about an hour last night, and put them on again as soon as I was out of bed this morning. I can still feel a bit of a twinge, but the limp I've been fighting for several weeks is gone, and the pain reduced by 90%. My issues: overpronation, plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis, gastrocnemius tendinopathy, hip instability - basically the connective tissue in my whole left leg is tight and inflamed and making things painful while restricting movement...and my right heel is starting to twinge in solidarity. Fun times.

The size Women's 9-9.5 fit into my Sketchers size 9 perfectly, with no extra room for sliding or pinching toes, and no bunching of the insole. I tried them with and without removing the shoes' original insole, and I think I prefer it with the shoes' insole, but more walking around in them today will decide that.

I'm really hoping these hold up. I'll be back to let you know if they don't."
5.0,"Really helped with my plantar fasciitis, the pain in the heel. I even have them in my house slippers. If you've ever had this pain in your feet you learn never to walk bare footed. Just pull your inserts out of your shoes and put these in, and immediately your feet feel better"
5.0,Perfect fit fast service
5.0,Dr. recommended these anf they have been great!  Easy to fit into your various shoes
5.0,Excellent
5.0,LOVE THESE!
3.0,It is too bad this company does not create a heel neutral version with a rigid arch support and extra padding (their Maxx has extra padding but pushes the foot out and their Journey  uses different padding it is not as comfortable since it is intended for hiking).
5.0,Buy everytime I get a new pair of shoes
5.0,Cushion and support.  It's exactly what I needed.
5.0,Replaced the insoles in my Sketchers GoWalks to get a bit more arch support. Does the job.
5.0,Fit fine. Worked as expected will buy again
5.0,"I still need time to see how much they help, but my Podiatrist recommended them so I bought them online (he said they'd be cheaper this way). They arrived quickly and they fit perfectly. I've been breaking them in about every third day as he said to do and so far so good."
5.0,"I am happy w/ these insoles, they add a lot of extra comfort to my Redwing boots.  They seem a little small, I think I would rather them be a little big and have to cut them down than for them to not reach the end of the foot bed.  I will most likely be buying this brand again."
5.0,Good product
5.0,Love this product
5.0,"The insoles work great, just what the doctor ordered."
5.0,"I couldn't even walk before these. So great, I want to order more!"
5.0,One of the best products for foot comfort and health.  It has been a great aid for my flat feet.  Daily use has completely eliminated my heel spur pain.  I highly recommend this product!
5.0,I used to wear orthotics from a podiatrist.  I have been wearing these for about 3 years now. Love them. They are more comfortable than custom orthotics. I have them in all of my shoes.
5.0,Relieved my plantar fasciitis pain most of the way. Great buy.
5.0,"these are great inserts. a foot doctor who wears them recommended them to me instead of buying the expensive good feet inserts.  He was right, they do work just as good and at $35 they are a steal.  Fit in all my athletic shoes, I am very happy with them."
4.0,A bit too stiff to be completely comfortable.
5.0,Great.
5.0,perfect
1.0,They make my shoes feel like they are too small.  I am returning them.
5.0,The insoles are really comfortable and help my feet at work.
5.0,"These arches as terrific!  I put them in my exercise sneakers.  (Just one note:  I bought a 71/2 for an 8 shoe and they fit perfectly.  So, you might think of going down 1/2 size for a perfect fit.)  I already increased my time on the treadmill, and was able to give up wearing an ankle support in the process.

I am definitely buying these again."
5.0,perfect
1.0,it is too thick to wear it inside a shoes.
5.0,I've been using these for a couple years and my shoes have never been more comfortable.  I can put these in a cheap pair of shoes and have excellent arch support and comfort.
5.0,"These fit my hiking boots like a glove (Not OJ Simpson's glove). I used it for my Keen Targhee II men's boots and did not need to trim the insoles at all. They can fit either on top of the original, thin Keen insoles or they can be taken out and replaced by the Powerstep insoles. The boots were a little big for me so I placed them over the original insoles and now they  fit perfectly plus the arch support is great."
3.0,Larger than expected so be prepared to break them in.
4.0,I spent months dealing with Plantar fasciitis. I tried superfeet green based on how many people said that the superfeet worked for them. Didn't work for me. Tried a brand called Sole from the local Scheels store based on the sales person expert knowledge. They didn't work for me either. Tried the Powerstep Pinnacle and was pleased that they worked. I no longer have the foot problem but I do have to wear shoes all of the time. I've been running again since February and still no problems. I have a pair all of the shoes I wear regularly.
5.0,Great support.  I will definitely be purchasing more.
4.0,"Use these orthotics in my walking sneakers they provide more arch support then the originals insoles, I will be replacing the original insoles in all my shoes with aftermarket insoles for comfort and support."
5.0,"These feet even better than the original, a bit more snug, but really help with walking.  Just got an ankle brace, and it is NOT as good as the shoe inserts..."
5.0,Fantastic product.  Highly recommend.
5.0,Better than my custom orthodics
5.0,I need an extra pair or two :-)
4.0,Fits as expected what more do you want from me
2.0,Doesn't add much comfort. It's just a little extra padding. And you have to wear thin socks
4.0,beats every DR scholls I have tried hands down spend a little more on a better product.
5.0,cushions my feet
5.0,"This is a really nice insert, I'm on my second pair. It fits all my shoes and helps my foot pain."
5.0,Put these in my walking shoes and my plantar faciatis has not reared its ugly head.  I cannot use them in my workout shoes for Jazzercize as they just don't seem comfortable with high impact.  They are great for walking tough and I highly recommend them
4.0,Great insoles. No more lower back pain and foot fatigue.
5.0,"These shoe inserts are essential for me because I have bunions, calluses, hammer toes & overlapping toes."
5.0,These insoles are super comfortable. I've been having plantar faciitis for the past couple months and this product has made my day much more tolerable. These are pretty thick so make sure you use it on a shoe with a lot of room. And don't forget to remove the original insoles that came with your shoes.
5.0,Great product and price!!!!
5.0,I was getting pain in what felt like my lower back/upper buttocks. It turned out to be be knots in my thigh (Vastus Lateralis). It was suggested to me to try an insole. I went to my local running store and they fitted me with these insoles. Pain is gone. As soon as it comes back I just replace my worn out ones and the problem is solved.
5.0,"These are really great replacement footbeds for shoes with removal footbeds. So much better than the original inserts! I use these interchangably in several pairs of shoes, including my hiking boots, my walking shoes, and some casual shoes. Just be aware that these are to replace the inserts in shoes with removable insoles, not to go ""on top"" of non-removable insoles. The arch support is really great, and I can really feel them keeping me from pronation. They get even more comfortable after the foam cushioning molds in a bit. Really great."
5.0,I love these.  They really help plantar fasciitis.  They fit well in my shoes too.  I mostly wear them with shoes that have shoe laces.
4.0,I've bought 6 or 7 pairs of these inserts over the years.  They provide excellent arch support.  I just wished they were a little more durable for active sports.  My right big toe tends to put a hole in these after a couple months of heavy use during sporting activity.
5.0,Very comfortable
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,"This is a wonderful product!  Even though it was a little large for my shoes, I was able to cut the orthotics to size.  They give me a fair amount of relief from my Plantar Fasciitis.  They were recommended by my Podiatrist, so I'm glad I got busy and ordered these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics."
5.0,"These were suggested to me by my physical therapist. I was a little skeptical, but turns out he was right. They really did help my knees."
5.0,Everything fine
5.0,"These are my GO TO insoles for as many of my shoes as possible. I have high arches and these make my shoes feel great. Not the best for dress shoes, but for anything else, I love these."
5.0,These are helping immensely with my Plantar Faciitis! Very comfortable and fit in my shoe perfectly. I just ordered another pair.
5.0,These orthotics were exactly what I was looking for.  Will buy them agsin.
5.0,These are almost as good as the EXPENSIVE orthotics that I got from my podiatrist last year. Love them! Just ordered another pair to have.
5.0,Just as advertised - they work great!
5.0,Great 
5.0,Best soles I've gotten so far
2.0,Awesome product but started falling apart after 2 months of wearing them otherwise it would be 5 stars from me
5.0,They work great.
5.0,Fits my  9.5 Saucony sneakers without even a trim.  Very comfy.  Have had the plain power steps but find the Pinnacle more supportive
5.0,Comfortable
5.0,"I have been using this orthotics for 6 years now for on and off plantar fasciitis, this was jut a replacement.  I have been satisfied."
5.0,Great product!!!
4.0,Fits great in one pair of shoes so I bought another and it's way too tight so maybe it's the shoes themselves but wish it was a tad thinner.
5.0,"Fit perfectly, very comfortable. Bought a second pair for athletic shoes after trying these for about 10 days in work shoes."
5.0,Best thing for foot comfort.
5.0,Excellent fit. I am very happy with product.
5.0,"Long lasting, comfortable and effective at helping me to avoid neuromas in my feet"
5.0,I have had custom orthotics made for over $100. These work as well! Hell of deal
3.0,"I guess they are very good insoles. However, I am looking for something thinner, and they have made my shoes too tight."
5.0,"These orthodics were recommended to me by my farrier, who also suffers from plantar faciitis.  I kept them in my snow boots all winter, and their added support greatly eased my foot pain."
5.0,"I have used these for a long time and they sure help with cushioning.
Amazon is the place to buy them from. best price."
5.0,I bought my first pair from the Doctor's office after foot surgery. Paid $76.00 ordered these and they are the same thing.
5.0,"I've tried Dr. Scholl's inserts to help my son's ankle/foot issues, but these are much better according to my son!"
5.0,"I'm on my feet and on the move from sun up until sundown and was pleasantly surprised when I received them, late in the day, and how good they felt. Very happy."
5.0,I over pronate and have ankle pain this power step help and is some what more  comfortable than any I have used
1.0,"Honestly, my feet are killing me after using these. They are actually throbbing. The fit seems fine so that is not the problem. I have other insoles that I have used with no problems."
5.0,"Fits as expected.
 Used product several years ago for plantar fasciaitis. Went away, but now returned in one heel, so looking for another ""cure"" as I resume use of these inserts."
5.0,Been using this product for years and it gives me relief of my foot pain.  Also recommended by my podiatrist.
5.0,"This insert was recommended to me by a fasciitis group.  I have custom inserts that were very expensive, but these are almost as good at a fraction of the price.  The quality is nice and they are wearing well."
5.0,The doctor said to buy them and I did.  They work great and seem to have helped my plantar fascia.  Take some getting used to but they work great.
5.0,I have an issue with my right foot that makes buying sports shoes very difficult but the Powersteps make the difference between Ahhh nd Ouch
5.0,I've been using these for a long time. They are great if you suffer from plantar fasciitis. No more pain.
4.0,"I have a pair of custom made orthotics for a posterior tibial tendon dysfunction. but I like to have these as a backup when they're being recovered. They fit quite well and while not quite as good, are still pretty good."
5.0,Very comfortable and sized right. Will definitely order additional sets in future . Arch support is in the right area of foot.
2.0,I was disappointed in these.  I buy these from my foot doctor and love them.  These however didn't seem to provide the same comfort.  So I had to buy two more from the doctors office.
5.0,These insoles provide good cushioning for my work environment which can require up to 9 hours a day on my feet.  At 71 years old I find the added arch support relieves previous discomfort whether on the job or at the gym.
4.0,"Pinnacle Orthotics once again have proven true to size. They are a nice support and help at providing continued relief.
Give them a try if you need help with your foot support."
5.0,Just bought another pair for some new shoes. I now own 3 pairs of these and couldn't be happier. I am flatfooted and they help my feet stay comfortable for all day wear of shoes that typically leave them uncomfortable.
5.0,"I have Plantar Fasciitis and this insole helps alot when walking around... it feels a little stif, but it works really well in the shoe"
2.0,The very first day I used them the top layer of fabric separated completely from the rest of the insole. They seem comfortable after a week but I am very unimpressed with the quality.
5.0,"I bought these for my mom as she gets weakness in her ankles after walking for a bit (she suffers from scleroderma and has arthritis like symptoms).  Her & my dad are on a 2-week vacation so I thought they were worth a try.  One-week into the vacation, and she says these have helped her tremendously.  Will be sending her another pair!!"
5.0,Best orthotic I've ever used!
5.0,great for alleviating my PF
5.0,Makes a huge difference in my expensive running shoes!
3.0,not worth the premium price
5.0,"i've used these in the past, but got the originals from my doctor, which means i paid twice as much.  these are the same and cheaper."
5.0,So far so good!
5.0,it's helped my left foot correct itself
1.0,"I have purchased several Powerstep products through the years - mainly ProTechs. They always fit well, supported my arch properly and were very durable. This time I thought I'd try the Pinnacle. Big mistake. Nowhere near the support or comfort, and, with respect to durability - the blue cloth top liner seperated completely first wearing. Save your money!"
3.0,"Functionality and fit were great, plantar fascia pain subsided quickly. Unfortunately fabric top loosened on day three I had to glue it back on. Poor performance for over $30. I hope my fix works, they are otherwise effective."
2.0,"The moment  I put my foot in my shoes I knew these were the right insoles.  I have a very high arch and I have gone through dozens of insoles looking for the right combination of arch support, heal support and cushioning.  These insoles have all three. There is just the right amount of arch support with the hard plastic portion of the insole which also extends to the heel area which helps with cushioning  and stability.  The front portion of the insole unfortunately is just like any average one which is why I gave it four stars not five. Note: the insole takes up quite a bit of room in your shoe so if your shoes are tight you may not be able to use them.

 Well my happiness was short-lived as I had to re-write my review. As you could see from the photograph  the arch support completely fell apart only after a few months of occasional wearing.  I was originally so excited with this product but now, meh.  I loved these until they fell apart. Not  sure and I want to do."
1.0,Will be returning these!
5.0,My wife loves these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics. They are well worth the price and very high quality too.
5.0,these are the best inserts
5.0,"I had purchased them at a local store first, to ensure fit.  It helps my feet a lot more than the ones that come in the shoes I buy."
4.0,"taking some time to break in, but feels much better than my shoes did without inserts. These are slightly more comfortable to me than my superfeet green were."
5.0,These best Super Feet. I feel these are as comfortable and they cost half as much.
5.0,Great product
5.0,Great insole! It's what the doctor would have ordered if I had gone to see him.
5.0,"Excellent product, hiking is now easier for me."
4.0,"Ultimately, much better for my feet than using the inserts in typical running shoes...provides much more arch support for long walks or runs"
5.0,Makes my feet happy.
5.0,These work very well for my planter fasciitis with great arch support.
5.0,"I've bought these for years to put in my running shoes.  I've never had a lower-leg stress injury since then.  The arch seems high and in the wrong place the first time you use them, but it's not.  After a while, it will feel like that's always how it should have been."
3.0,They're really not helping my problem in the metatarsal area...
5.0,"Having had plantar fasciitis, I am very aware of my arch support needs.  To that end, the Powerstep Pinnacle fills the need.  They fit well in the shoes that I wear.  I would highly recommend them."
1.0,"I thought I'd found a fantastic insert... it was not too thick and seemed to provide good arch support.  However, 2 days of wear and the blue layer is already peeling near the heel!!!"
5.0,I have had them in size 12 Danner work boots for 2 days now.  So far so good.
1.0,Your shoe has to be larger than normal to use this as it makes your foot sit higher in the shoe.  I returned it.
4.0,"So far so good! Really good arch support, which I need. Highly recommended by my podiatrist for over pronation."
5.0,will be ordering another pair this weekend for my other pair of barn shoes!
5.0,Excellent support.  My third pair.
3.0,They were too wide for my shoes. I ordered another pair in a smaller size and only 3/4 length.  Hope they work
5.0,"I've had another brand in the same product, these cost a little more but well worth it."
2.0,They hurt my feet
5.0,"I've used these orthotics/insoles in the past, and they compare favorably to ones that I got from my podiatrist for $50."
5.0,"work great, great support yet comfortable"
5.0,Supports the arch well and feels comfortable
5.0,"Good Price, Good Quality"
5.0,Great product if you have planter faciatis!
1.0,These are too hard. The arch hits where your heel is. It's like walking with rocks in your shoes. My feet were very sore after using these. Returning.
5.0,Good for comfy
1.0,This product was shipped to us and the box was opened. When I took the item out of the box it clearly looks like someone has previously worn this pair of orthotics.
3.0,Heel was flat after a couple weeks. Arch support is still god though.
5.0,Very nice fitting orthotic with good arch support.
5.0,A must for those working on thier feet or with any pronation. problems or plantar issues. Very helpful
5.0,I have now purchased these fro every pair of shoes.
5.0,"They fit perfectly, I wear a size 12.  No trimming required and they helped even a new pair of shoes.  My feet still hurt after a long day, but not like before.  Much better than the ones you buy at the drugstore!"
4.0,Makes my arches ache. Other then that ok
4.0,I expected a little more cushion
4.0,"I have been an avid user for 4 years.
Two nine spurs and former athlete."
3.0,"Great fit, great price."
5.0,The product was exactly what I needed to help me with my foot issue.
1.0,Heal has already wore through and can not be worn any longer. I have been buying the Powerstep for years and have NEVER had one fall apart in just a few months...makes me wonder if I really got what I paid for...
5.0,"So far so good.. it really made a big difference from pad that comes in my new shoes.. but i feel good with it.. hopefully the feeling continues.. highly recommended.. for the prize, can't beat the comfort.."
5.0,"I've tried a lot of inserts. Too many have completely unnatural shaps that won't fit anyone's foot.

These are among a small set of inserts with a well chosen shape. For my foot, this one fits my arch and heel better than any I've tried. Your foot shape might make you a better match for a different insert, but this one can not be faulted for being well made.

There are several excellent inserts on the market.

I love these. Rigid bottom with modest cushion fabric layers on top. The shape of these is superb. I've tried several good inserts, and several inserts . These fit my foot best."
5.0,"This pair of insoles fit my size 14 wide hiking boots perfectly. They are a vast improvement over the insoles provided by Merrell. One thing I really appreciated is, no trimming was required. It's a nice feature, that they're actually sized for my boots. And not a one size fits many, but trimming required, insoles. Plus, the support provided is far superior to any of the insoles, I've previously purchased at an equal or greater cost. I will be purchasing additional pairs for my other shoes and boots. I consider these to be well worth the money spent."
5.0,The insoles are helping my plantar fasciitis.
5.0,So far good as expected.
3.0,"I question if this is a replica or the original product by PowerStep manufacturers. Feels different, perhaps not as leveled."
5.0,Perfect fit.  Good product.
4.0,Recommended by my podiatrist.  Helps a lot with my plantar fasciitis
5.0,"These worked great! I have custom orthotics and actually prefer these to them, definitely a more affordable option"
5.0,First of. I'm not some person claiming to have five hundred different disabilities and 30 surgeries. No I'm a 23 year old college student who has a job as a server and who's feet really hurt. I was going to purchase superfeet but everyone said these were better and for half the price why not??! Well I got them Friday and worked Easter weekend in them to see if they would be what everyone says. Without a doubt they are. Yes my feet still are a little sore. But the difference is night and day and makes everything so much better! Definitely would recommend
3.0,They fit smaller than my  PowerStep ProTech insoles.  I thought they would be the same
3.0,It was ok.  I probably needed more cushioning.
4.0,"I buy these for every new pair of sneakers (Or Sketches CAT's) I buy.
They feel weird the first few days or so, but after that I cannot imagine not having them.
They key is to wear the new sneakers with them a couple hours a day (at night) to break them in.
When putting on a pair of sneakers without them to work out in the yard, my feet really feel it later.

Don't be put off by them feeling odd the first week.
Stick with it and you won't regret it.

One point is there are so many versions.
I used to pay low 20's, but now good ones are 40 or so for the best versions.
So, I find myself buying the regular Pinnacle's because of the cost."
4.0,I am sing it in a pair of sneakers.  Replaced the existing sole with the Powerstep.
4.0,They are offering some relief to my foot problem.  I hope with time they do what they claim.
4.0,Relieves fatigue from working all day
4.0,It fits fine and help your foot pain.
5.0,"Fits and feels amazing, I immediately order another for my boots as my boots were my favorite and have had them 15 years but the inside had broken down. I have refused to throw the boots away just because everything else is fine with them.  Other insoles moved around and just didn't work but then these Powerstep Pinnicale have made it a new boot."
5.0,What I really needed. Best arch support.
5.0,Really help with my bad feet
5.0,I was experiencing foot pain and my podiatrist recommended the insoles and they work very well.
5.0,They are amazing. They don't look like gel inserts. Thinner so you don't have to size up in shoes. Had plantar fascitis pain but no more. I'm an RN who works twelve hour shifts. Inserts provide great arch support and have padding in heel. They are well worth the money
4.0,"I am a wearer of Custom made Orthodics and find thes to be, more comfortable. They fit better and seat lower, than others, I've purchased. The support is a bonus."
5.0,I've purchased several
5.0,This product allowed me to function without pain again.
5.0,Nice cushioning and works for well for my pronation
5.0,"I bought these for my husband who was having some pretty severe plantar fascitis. I read up on insoles and decided on these for a few reasons- The arch support is rigid vs foam or gel, which I felt would give insufficient support from looking at the various reviews, and secondly, the price point wasn't outrageous.

And I was right. The relief he got from these insoles was immediate. His pain went from an 8 to a 2. He's only been on them for about 4 days now, and the unbearable, relentless pain from the PF has been greatly reduced, even after he takes his shoes off after a full 9 hour work day. So they're working both for immediate relief, and for the more slow healing/correcting process for that tendon. Great product."
5.0,These offer great support. I have plantar fasciitis and these inserts have helped to reduce the pain in my feet.
5.0,"Nice, very comfortable  & good support"
1.0,Too hard...could not use
5.0,Very happy with the purchase
5.0,Good and relieve the pain on my foot.
5.0,"These inserts give firm support in the arch.  I was experiencing shin pain and these have helped significantly. Despite the good support, I expected more cushioning than this support provides.  If you're looking for more cushioning than support, I would look for a different product with that specific feature. Otherwise, great product and good price."
5.0,best insole around even foe plantar fasciitis.
5.0,My feet thank pinnacle for these insoles.  I feel like I am walking on clouds.  I can go places and not worry that my feet will hurt because I walked around all day.
4.0,Nice product unless you are flat footed.  Had to remove them after a day.
5.0,Fits very will.
5.0,These are great.  Solved my plantar problem.  Take a little-known getting used to but now I wouldn't be without them.
4.0,"Great support . Had some foot issues that didn't go away, bought some new shoes and these babies and it solved my problem. I have 3 sets so I don't have to keep taking them out ."
5.0,Excellent support
5.0,"Comfortable, great fit for my high arch."
5.0,Fit just right ..comfortable too
4.0,"My new podiatrist recommended these over the custom orthotics I was prescribed from my last foot doctor. They are pretty expensive for what they are but I do have to say the arch support is firm and doesn't mash down with steps.
The problem with my feet is that I have EDS hypermobility type (a connective tissue disorder) and the bones in my feet move around easily therefore causing lots of instability and an arch that disappears the moment I stand up.

In terms of arch support these are very good. In terms of offering stability - not so much. There's very little heel cup and they are exceptionally thin and have zero stiffness and no ball of foot cushioning.

Frankly, I have no idea why he recommended these to me given the nature of my foot problems.

I tried another type of insert from this same company that is stiffer overall, has arch support (though not as firm as these) and a nice deep heel cup for stability."
3.0,"I ordered these expecting to be an alternative to my athletic insoles, but they are almost as hard, and as wide. It didn't serve the purpose I purchased them for--to use inside casual and fashion shoes--therefore i am returning them. I ordered my exact size which is 6-6.5, but they didn't fit in my regular oxford shoes for example. The toe is too wide, it didn't fit the shoes, it was too big."
5.0,Excellent product.  Really helps!
4.0,"Their what the customer said they were but my feet still hurt when I walk my 4 or 5 miles, but I don't think I could walk the 4 or 5 miles without them."
3.0,They're too wide for most of my shoes and boots.
5.0,"I needed replacements, and these fit perfectly and feel good walking."
5.0,Fantastic
5.0,"Perfect, and a lot less than at the doctors,office for the same thing!"
5.0,Fits as expected  thanks
5.0,Great insole!
5.0,Fit great. Could really feel a difference right away. So far I am satisfied. Will be using them for standing at job.  Hope they help.
5.0,"Second time buying these, Im on my feet all day and nothing compares to these inserts. The first time I stepped in them I knew they were great. The support is amazing. I'm not gonna switch them between shoes as often this time to try to preserve them. Give them a shot!"
4.0,"This is my second pair, first pair is still in good shape.  I'm a size 12 and the 12-13.5 fills my shoe nicely.  They swap from shoe to shoe easily enough but I wanted a second pair for convenience."
5.0,"If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would, but for the money, these are excellent insoles. I primarily bought these for my athletic shoes, and they work great for that purpose. They are not as good as my $200+ prescription orthotics, but who would expect them to be for this price? My Rx ones were getting worn out, and between the price of those and the process I had to go through to get them, I thought this was worth a shot. I'm glad I tried them. I plan to buy a couple more pairs, so I don't have to keep switching these out of multiple pairs of shoes."
5.0,Great quality orthotics at excellent price
5.0,"I love these so much, I ordered again. I just need to trim a little to fit my shoes"
5.0,Great metatarsal support.
5.0,Excellent fit and feel.
5.0,"These were recommended to me by my orthopedist. Each color does something a bit different so just be aware of that. The ones I bough a few years back I had to trim down to fit inside my size 13, wide toe box hiking boot. But the most recent one I purchased fit just right (same shoe brand and make). They give my arches just enough support that I was able to wean off my much bulkier custom orthotic. They're a wide, though - but to me, it's worth it. Love them."
5.0,"Short:  These are a great insert for someone just dealing with Plantar Fascitis.  I like to jog/run 5-6 days a week (shorter 2-3 mile runs) and was getting quite depressed due to my inability to go very far without discomfort.  These have alleviated 90% of my discomfort and I am able to job near daily again and find that I can walk much longer in a day than before.  Highly Recommend.

Long:  I Bought these as I enjoy running/jogging and started to develop Plantar Fascititis.  Upon a lot of research I was originally directed to the green Superfeet insert but found that those did not help much (just do not fit into the arch well).  I originally was quite upset as I thought it was my feet and not a problem with the insert.  Before giving in and spending $800 at the Good Feet store for their inserts, I tried these on a recommendation from a friend.

I can say these inserts are exactly what I needed.  At first I thought they would at least be 'better' but I have found these to work very well and has allowed me to get back on my feet regularly again.  I enjoy my longer 3 mile jogs and can run more days in a row without resting than before.

If you are like me and tend to do a lot of research I'm guessing you too will be directed to the Superfeet product.  I would highly recommend trying these first at less than hald the cost (and only 5% of the cost of GoodFeet store inserts)."
4.0,So far this item has been great
5.0,so far soooooooooo goooood.....These are helping out a lot!
4.0,Right Product
5.0,I love these. Work great for me.
4.0,Fits as expected but I wish they would give you little additional pads to increase arch height if needed. Like all orthodontics you get used to them and still need a little more support.
3.0,"Very nice insole, but sadly not quite enough arch support for my flat feet. Their Maxx model is perfect for me, and their Journey Hiker is a close second."
4.0,"I bought these and the Pinnacle Maxx inserts. Both are very comfortable, the Maxx inserts are just sturdier."
4.0,Work good so far but only had them a week
5.0,Saved my feet from plantar fasciitis! Got several pair.
5.0,Good fit and good arch support
5.0,Great for  heel pain
5.0,Helped my son's feet.  He runs track and cross country and was having heel pain and hasn't had any since wearing the insoles.
4.0,As expected
4.0,I cut them. They work great. Order a size down.
5.0,Just as expected. Great price!
5.0,Power step pinnacle inserts fit just as advertised and replaced the actual shoe insert perfectly. They do feel great and supportive as I needed for a comfortable wear throughout the day.
5.0,Everything went well
3.0,"The instructions to use the measurement of the foot (heel to tip of the big toe) did not account for the additional space within foot ware.  As a result, I received insoles that are one inch too short to properly by full-length.  When I order again I will increase the length specification to get what is wanted."
5.0,They are more comfortable than I expected and fit into my shoes really well. I love them.
5.0,"Omg! I have plantar fasciitis and these are the BEST INSOLES EVER! they allow me to be on my feet all day, on cement . I work at costco and I can't tell you how greatful I am for these. Will buy more!"
5.0,Very comfortable...great support...all of our shoes have these inserts!
5.0,I love these orthotics. I use them for Plantar Fascitis and put them in my Hoka One One Challengers. They're really helpful!
5.0,Love them.
5.0,Can't go without them.
4.0,"I bought size 13 for my size 13 shoes However, they moved around in the shoe because they fit 12-13. So I ordered size 14 for my size 13 shoe and now fit perfectly.

So I'd purchase one size up and trim if needed. I didn't need to trim."
5.0,Great
4.0,Comfortable but I wish they lasted longer.
5.0,Very comfortable.
1.0,Damaged
4.0,"Day two, not bad, I feel better, less tired, ask me in a week!"
5.0,Great for plantar facitis
4.0,Comfy and decent quality for the price.
5.0,Feel great!
5.0,Nice insoles.  They keep my heel pain controlled
4.0,"I was starting to have very painful Achilles tendinopathy, plantar faciitis and heel spurs.  These insole coupled with physical therapy worked wonders.  I bought a second set so I did not have to keep sharing the same in different shoes."
5.0,My wife has bone spurs and with these she is much more comfortable. She likes these a lot and has several sets. We will order more when needed.
5.0,"I have been using these for years and love them.  I put them in every running shoe I get,"
3.0,OK fit
5.0,These are the most comfortable insoles that I have tried to date.
4.0,these fit most of my shoes !
5.0,"Great product, exactly what I needed."
5.0,"My orthopedic doctor sold me my first pair and now I never go without them. My mom was having problems with tendonitis in her shins, I sent her a pair of these and no more tendonitis!"
5.0,Great fit!
5.0,I have really flat feet that are constantly in pain. These inserts take a lot of pain away
3.0,I thought The power steps were all the same. I prefer the Pro tech version with the cushioned heel
4.0,Has relieved some of my heel pain.
1.0,No good
5.0,work great
4.0,No problems so far. Liitle firmer would be better
5.0,Recommended by my Podiatrist
5.0,all ok
5.0,"easy to use, good arch support. 3 day break in time for feet to be comfortable."
1.0,"Caused med pain in knees, ankles, hips and back"
5.0,"This is very comfortable. For women, they fit nicely into full height boots but the size is not conducive to all types of shoes because they don't fit into the shoe bed. I still love them."
3.0,They are overpriced
3.0,It was too think to fit into my shoe. I could cut it down to fit across but it was too thick. You can't cut that down.
5.0,"I've been buying similar products for last 30 years, these are the best."
4.0,My doctor recommended this brand and she was right. Most of all my foot pain has stopped. Feel much better. Would highly recommend these.
4.0,Product arrived on time and was as expected. Good fit
5.0,Works like a champ! Casual shoe (Dunham). Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"The overal quality (construction) and feel of these foot insoles are phenomenal! For the price, they're the best I've bought in my 8 years of researching and buying foot insoles. I have flat feet and I'm on my feet all day, I'm a full time teacher and an occupational therapist at night and I put wear and tear on shoes and my legs. These in particular fit a bit wide for most of my shoes so there's a slight stretch to my shoes. Either than that they make me feel like my feet are using half the energy they were before!"
4.0,These have helped a great deal with the comfort level of my tennis shoes but I am still not free from pain.
4.0,"They are not quite as wide as I need them (US 10 1/2, 4E) but the length is correct."
5.0,Cool walk !!!
3.0,"The footprint of this insole fit my show just fine, but it is too thick and caused the tops of my toes to get blisters from rubbing against the inside top of my shoes.  I bought these on the recommendation of my podiatrist for heel nerve pain, but she should have specified a 1/2 or 3/4 length.  Ended up buying something else.  If being used in a shoe or work boot that ties, it may work fine because you can loosen the laces, but not a good idea for slip-on street/dress shoes."
5.0,the best shoe insoles
5.0,Didn't have to cut to size they were perfect.  Had to take the old insole out to fit in my walking shoes.
5.0,I wear size 7.5 and they fit perfectly into my shoes.  This my first experience with insoles and chose these because my sister's podiatrist recommended this brand for her plantar faci itus.  I ordered the Pinnacle and the regular.  I feel the Pinnacle has more padding and will continue to order these for my shoes.
4.0,They are ok. I like my Sole insoles better.
5.0,I ordered these on the advice of my orthopedic specialist and I love them! They work great! I wear them to work everyday. I have Posterior Tibial Tendinitis and they are really helping me.
4.0,They were ok. I haven't had any problems with them.
5.0,"Great insoles, worth the price."
5.0,Great for my service industry work shoes. Comfortable and supportive.
4.0,Feel great
4.0,These inserts were recommended by a Podiatrist to relieve the discomfort of Peroneal tendonitis and so far they have done their job well.
5.0,prefect!!  thank you!
5.0,"These inserts are working very well in my husband's winter boots. He said they were slightly firm at first, but they have become far more comfortable with additional wearing, as they shape to his foot."
5.0,Great fit. My feet feel really good.
5.0,I have a high arch and often find it difficult to get the right support.  I purchased these for both the arch support and ongoing heel pain I have been experiencing and they have been great!
3.0,"These  we're ok, but as the day wore on, the harder they got.  My feet are in miserable shape and these are not good enough for me.  They have decent arch support, but not nearly as good as those from the podiatrist.  They also need a bit m ore cushioning."
4.0,Good so far
5.0,Great
4.0,love them
4.0,Comfortable.  Didn't stop plantar fasciitis pain however.
3.0,Size fit but too high an instep for me. Had to return
5.0,"I have had several more expensive insoles in the past, and these are just as good. Great support and cushion."
5.0,Works forme
5.0,Perfect fit. And feel good support.
5.0,"I got these insoles on the recommendation of my podiatrist to help my plantar fasciitis. She suggested that these were more affordable than custom orthotics and I might want to try them before ordering the custom ones. I'm glad I did. I have them in all my shoes now, and have recommended them to other family members. They fit my wide feet well."
5.0,"These insoles work very well for my feet. I have a very high arch, and plantar fasciitis.  These have worked the best of any. I no longer have issues with my feet"
5.0,Amazing insoles. Now I don't even remember that i wear heavy workbooks anymore. Will buy more for other shoes.
1.0,It was too large and not enough support for my heels.
5.0,Fit perfectly and fast delivery
4.0,"So far, so good.  Seems comfortable and well crafted."
5.0,Best over-the-counter insoles out there.
5.0,Better than getting form fitted orthotics
5.0,Used these for years. Never have foot problems.
5.0,really work
5.0,
5.0,Got these to replace the inserts that were in a pair of Wolverine shoes. Was about to throw the shoes away because they hurt my feet. Replaced the inserts and they are like a new pair.
5.0,"These are exactly as I have purchased in the past. I have issues with plantar fasciitis and these orthotics are great, actually better then the custom made $400 version from the podiatrist.  These last just about as long so I can buy several pairs for the price on one custom orthotic. Awesome product.  I have been wearing these for many years."
4.0,OK
5.0,My feet love these. They're great!!!
5.0,Have worn these for years... great arch support!
4.0,Improved comfort for walking.
5.0,"Have been using for many years.,use because of heel spurs ,very good product"
5.0,These insoles are comparable to custom made orthotics prescribed by my podiatrist. They have a shorter life span and will need to be replaced after three to four months if you walk a lot.
5.0,"I have a pair in each of my shoes, they are great!"
5.0,Great support for plantar fasciatis. Helps a lot with walking (for exercise) with these insoles in. I think the Powerstep insoles may be helping my knees too. I highly recommend them. The Powerstep Pinnacle gives a lot of arch support. It raises your foot in the shoe. I just loosened my laces when I inserted them in my shoes and it felt fine. I suggest buying the powerstep insoles first and then taking them to the store to buy your athletic shoes. By trying the athletic shoes on with the powerstep insoles you will get the best athletic shoe with the great support of the Powerstep insoles.
5.0,"Love these! If you have plantar fasciitis, buy these now. Completely eliminated my pain. I had been using Vionic inserts, but these are much better."
5.0,Have had many pairs over the years. Truly the best retail product outside of professional orthotics!
5.0,perfect insoles.exactly what I needed.
4.0,"I wear a size 7 shoe and these are a bit long.  They seem to work for support, although wearing in shoes where the original insoles won't come out makes shoes really tight.  I still have to work with these to figure out the best use for them."
4.0,These are very good arch supports for small price.
5.0,great product for feet!
5.0,"WOW!  Finally!

I've tried every insole on the market over the years.  I tried them when I was still able to be a CNC Machinist and Forewoman to try to save my Lower Back and ease my Plantar Fascilitis and now that I've had to quit my trade and go into Physical Therapy because of the aforementioned back getting much worse and going from ""really painful at a high-intensity, heavy-lifting job pain"" to ""I can't even walk upright or do anything but gentle stretches type-pain"".

I've begun Physical Therapy for my Lower Back & a Torn Rotater Ruff (yeah....terrible luck, I know) so I'm on my own for the PF because the Physical Therapist can only target so many areas at once.  I've been trying inserts for at least 10 years and they all caused my nearly instant and HORRIBLE pain and usually made my PF much worse.  Plus, they usually required cutting and trimming and didn't fit a variety of shoes to be truly versatile.

I bought these and kept all of the packaging because I fully expected to be sending them back.  Well...I threw out that packaging after my 1st week using these in my Running/Gym shoes as well as my casual shoes and some Snow Boots.  These have not just improved my Lower-Back Pain immensely....but my PF is 65% better (I'm also using PF Compression Socks, mind you and wearing those to bed to repair/heal).

What's amazing to me is that I'm also going to the Gym and doing 90-minute Cardio Sessions 6 days per week on top of the Physical Therapy to strengthen my whole body, lose the weight I've gained being unable to work/workout, and to build muscle near the areas that are injured.  So I'm wearing these things in my Running Shoes and wearing them for 90 minutes per day on Standing Ellipticals, Seated Ellipticals, Treadmills, and Leg Press Machines.  And there's NO PF pain throbbing afterward!  These are ROCK HARD insoles.  Please keep that in mind.  I think most people *myself included* fall for the ""gel insoles"" and ""memory foam comfort"" stuff thinking that will be better for our feet and PF (or back issues) because it seems like a cushioned sole would be best.  Now that I've tried these, I get why the others didn't work.  We need HARD Support.  If you can't tolerate hard insoles for some reason....these are not for you.  If you have lower back pain or PF and other insoles have failed you....you NEED to try these.

I purchased the Women's Size 8 - 8.5 and these fit my Running/Athletic shoes PERFECTLY.  Slipped them right in (after removing the original insoles, of course) and dared to go straight to the Gym and *hope* these would work out.  Well...they did!  Much better than my *expensive branded insole that came with said running shoe* and a notable difference in PF right away.

I didn't have to trim them at all and since they are so hard, you can easily slip them into and out of your shoes for a quick change.  I put them into my furry Uggs the next day and they fit just as well and kept the PF and lower back pain at bay.  I couldn't believe they were working.  I am so used to them feeling ""OK"" at first and then after a day or two causing a ""new"" pain or worsening old pain and having to throw away expensive insoles.  These are like a MIRACLE!  I haven't had a burning/shooting heel since I put these into my running shoes and considering my 6 days per week Gym Schedule and Physical Therapy is new to my body as well as HARD on my body....this seems amazing to me.

Don't stress about the sizing.  It's right on point.  Get whatever closely matches your normal shoe size because these are right on point.  They're also a bit wider (than I need because I have a very ""normal"" width foot) so if your foot is a little on the wider side, these have the extra space to fit them without making ""normals"" fit any lesser.  The arch is very high and hard and really supports you where you need it.  The contour and outside diameter is cut much more accurately than others and I think that's part of why no trimming is needed and if you buy your correct size....these should bit your current shoes like a glove.  I originally felt really stupid for spending this kind of money on *yet another* pair of insoles that are supposed to be ""so awesome"" ....but never worked for ME.  Now I can't wait to try some of their ""slimmer"" fits so that I can wear my evening shoes and other slimmer shoes without pain, as well.

The photos I'm posting show the running shoes I wear for Physical Therapy and the Gym with the original insole taken out in one shoe....and this insole placed inside of the other shoe.  The insole itself is laid next to the shoe for size and width comparison.  I also included a photo of the insole from the side-view to see the contour, and a photo of my bare foot (that's a compression sock) against just the insole to show how good the sizing is and how it fits a bare foot.

I highly recommend these - especially if you've tried every other brand and style and have decided *like me* that insoles just aren't ""for your problem"".  Because these ARE.  I really urge anyone with PF or Back Pain to give them a try! NO cons to this product.  Will buy again and again."
4.0,Great Product
1.0,"They are seriously not true to size! Way too small, very disappointed! Ordered 9 1/2 what I got was more like a 7! Have them away because they were useless to me."
5.0,"These insoles are perfect, and I liked the cost."
5.0,Fantastic support.  I feel so much better already.  I have a torn tendon and the foot Dr. recommenced I get this.
4.0,So far So good
5.0,My wife says they help her ailing feet a lot.
5.0,Love it
5.0,"These are great for those who have planters fasciitis or other foot problems.  I had a serious problem in the arch of my foot, and my husband suggested trying these Orthotics.  They are firm but not hard.  And they don't have the type of foam that absorbs foot odor.  My husband has used these for years.  I just started using them.  My only suggestion would be to buy a new pair with each new pair of shoes."
5.0,"At first, I thought I would have to trim some of the sides off of the insole, but it fit perfectly.  My daughter loves how they feel."
5.0,"I suffer from plantar fasciitis, and struggled with finding the right insole for months. Once I found these....I instantly loved them! I bought a pair literally for each pair of shoes I own! They are perfect in every way! I've never had to trim them, they fit well in all of my shoes and boots. I will not wear a pair of shoes without them!"
5.0,Excellent insoles! My feet (especially my heels) and back were killing me prior to installing them in a pair of work boots. The reviews were excellent; so I purchased them. Glad I did. These insoles will work great as long as you order your correct shoe size. They are the exact size as sold and are easy to insert into your boot or shoe. Awesome insole! Comfy and no more pain!
5.0,I took these to my sports medicine doctor and he said they were great.  They sell them at their practice.
5.0,Best insoles I have ever worn! So good that I purchased a second pair. They give really good arch support without adding bulk to the interior of my shoes. No need to trim them as they somehow fit perfectly into every pair of shoes - I even use them in my Tom's. Plus they are easy to clean with soap and water.
5.0,"great item for the price, adds support to any type of shoe."
5.0,Provides good arch support
4.0,"So far, very happy with the product."
4.0,Very comfortable and fits great. Sizes run a little small. I wear 8 1/2 but ordered 9 1/2. Very pleased with product. Brand was recommended by podiatrist .
5.0,"These are the ones my doctor specifically recommended, and after my fat spotted sausage (nick name for new puppy) decided to nom them, I was very happy to find replacements here and not need to drive 3 hours out of the way and pay nearly double at a specialty store made me and my puppy's future a much happier place."
2.0,I had to return them. I couldn't get my feet into any shoes I put them in. Got the 3/4 thins instead and love them!
5.0,they fit and do the job very well. these are my second pare
5.0,Love them!
1.0,Supposed to fit size  12 and 13. I wear a 12 and there a inch and a half short.
5.0,They really help!
5.0,Very Helpful and comfortable... Excellent arch & heel support.
5.0,This was recommended by a specialist. It is perfect.
5.0,"After emergency surgery about a year ago that left my foot a little flatter than it was before, walking unassisted has been extremely painful.  I've been using one of these (just the injured foot) for about 3 days and already I'm seeing a massive improvement."
3.0,They were out in about a couple of months
4.0,Still trying them out to see if they help my foot pain.
4.0,Good support for the price
5.0,These insoles have been sent from heaven as far as I can tell. I say that because I have struggled with planter fasciitis for a number of years now and nothing has come close to helping as much as these insoles. I know that feet are not the same from person to person but if you struggle to find shoes that offer you good arch support than please give these a try. They were a game changer for me. I have now bought many pairs since I first gave them a try. I have them in every pair of shoes that I own. Even after  a year they still offer support. I have worn a hole through the tow area on one pair that is over a year old and they still offer great arch support.
5.0,I have used these for years and they have made a major difference by providing a good arch.
5.0,Perfect!!
5.0,Very comfortable.
5.0,These things are a life saver. This product was recommended to me by my podiatrist because I have planter fasciitis. Found it for a lot cheaper through Amazon and they are amazing. My pain has completely stopped.
5.0,Love these!
5.0,Recommended by a friend to save my feet and back. I love them!
5.0,I had bought a pair and they work great! So I ordered 2 more pair for my other shoes! Great for foot pain!
5.0,"Comfy as usual.  I've tried others, these feel the best."
5.0,Fit perfectly and it is very comfortable.
5.0,Size fits as expected. Will be buying again.
5.0,"My new favorite OTC orthotic, as recommended by my GP.  I have a high arch and pronate.  I have used these for Nordic skiing (skate), running and hiking, and they are awesome.  I had been nursing an irritated bunion, but these have helped with the recovery and preventing further irritation.

Previously I tried other OTC orthotics and custom orthotics.  This model has a nice balance of firm foam-based support in just the right areas.  The bed also feels natural cradle for my skinny heels."
4.0,"Feel great, will buy again."
5.0,I like these a lot.  They are firm without being unforgiving.  I am extremely flat-footed and these ease the pain.
5.0,"A great pair of insoles, I have since purchased a second pair.  One slight comment is that the fabric surface may tend to delaminate from the cushion.  No matter, they feel great!"
5.0,This product is worth every penny. It provides incredible support. I've had plantar fasciitis in the past and I'm extremely picky about my footwear and products. I have multiple pairs now and switch them around between my boots and running shoes.
5.0,"These are slightly different from the ones I'd already had, but should work fine."
5.0,"Everyone is different and responds differently to treatments. I have tried acupuncture, Reiki, the interminable calf stretches, cold packs, hot packs, support socks, etc. for nagging plantar fasciitis.  These insoles don't cure it, but at least I can walk like a normal person again. Minimal pain and discomfort. Thanks to my orthopedist for recommending them and Amazon reviews for evaluating them. At $30, these are a bargain."
5.0,Thank you!
5.0,This fit well and last two years for me. I have an odd step pattern but these powersteps work well and last a long time. This is the second time I've ordered them and keep them in all my dress shoes.
5.0,I have been in a lot of pain because my feet are hyperpronating. These insoles have decreased my pain better than the expensive custom fit orthopedics I bought from the Pediatrist. Custom orthotics start at $300 on up. Save your money and buy this product instead.
1.0,They did not work out for me at all. They are way too big and too awkward.
5.0,"Love these I have 2 pair, great product, great price."
5.0,Fit really well.
5.0,The best insoles I've ever had PERIOD.
5.0,Fits good inside shoe. Comfortable to wear
5.0,Feel Great. Love them!
5.0,Really did help while i was dealing with plantar faciatis- will never stop using them now
5.0,My feet love me for wearing these inserts.  I have high arches and wore custom orthodic inserts but I have switched over to these and I love them. No more plantar problems.
5.0,"I bought these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics-U men's insoles for my husband several months ago.
They have helped him considerably and now he has requested that I order two more pairs.
So that is the best product endorsement!"
5.0,Much better arch support compared to what shoes come with. Helped reduce heal pain too.
5.0,"Great insole! Perfect amount of support and cushion. Very impressed. Expensive, but worth it."
5.0,These provide great support. I've walked quite a few miles since I got these and they work great.
5.0,I love them. The size fit perfectly and feels like just like the ones I bought for $80. I am going to order 2 more sets for my other shoes.
5.0,Now he's insisting that I buy a pair. I probably will. He's been doing nothing but bragging about how good his feet feel now. He does walk all day. If anybody knows how good your feet can feel when you have good insoles it's him. He definitely recommends them.
5.0,These insoles are amazing! Buy several pairs!!!
5.0,Definitely helped my planters fasitous!
2.0,"I am an engineer, am on my feet at work most of the day, and am expected to wear business casual attire.  I bought these insoles hoping they would reduce soreness I sometimes feel in my feet at night after a long day at work.  The insoles do offer great support for my feet, but do not fit into any of my work appropriate shoes.

I tried to fit these insoles into slip-ons, loafers, leather tennis shoes, and steel toe work boots.  While the insoles would slip into the shoe, when I tried to put the shoes on I found that in every case the insole was too thick, painfully squishing my toes against the top of the shoe and causing my heel to slip out.  I tried these out in just about every shoe I own, and the only shoes they fit into are my tennis shoes for jogging.

Overall, the support these insoles provide is pretty good, but what good is an insole that doesn't fit into your shoes?"
4.0,They have help my feet already
5.0,Buy these for all my athletic shoes.  I need the arch support.  It was nice to save a few dollars by buying on line.
4.0,Very good product for the price!
5.0,GOOD fit
1.0,"I'm sure these would generally be okay, but I need a different type of insert for the foot pain that I am experiencing. Plus this style made my tennis shoes tight and I wear flats often and these don't work with flats."
4.0,Works as described
5.0,Great product. I wear them to play tennis and they feel very comfortable. They also helped to diminish the ankle pain I ussualy feel after playing.
5.0,Fit my shoe perfectly.  I like them.
2.0,These take up way too much space in shoes.
4.0,Good but a little pricey.
5.0,Love these!
5.0,"Completely relived the metatarsal pain I was having. And, I still have it bare footed, so I know they're working."
5.0,"These are great inserts for overall foot comfort.  I have high arches and have had trouble finding inserts that will support my aches.  After 6 weeks of physical therapy due to plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis, I ordered these powerstep orthotics.  These felt much better than the ones they customized for me at the Physical therapy.  I will be ordering more to put in all my shoes so I don't have to keep switching them from one to the other.  I wear an 8 1/2 to 9 shoe and ordered the Women's 9-9 1/2 size.  I am glad I did for these fit perfectly in my athletic size 9 shoes."
4.0,good stuff will buy again
5.0,Helps provide comfortable arch support for runners. Used for long distance running as well as daily footwear.
5.0,"I bought this and the Dr Sholls to review.

No Comparison. These are quality you can feel.  A flabby strip of jell doesnt do your feet any good."
5.0,excellent product.
4.0,Great support.  I am able to work out again without plantar fasciitis pain.  Would prefer a little more cushion.
3.0,"Fit good, but lacked support in arch."
1.0,"Nice looking but functionally it's absolutely ridiculous - the open and close just gets bumped and it's immediately closed.  Absolutely pathetic and ridiculous since you won't have heat or ac in your room.

Recommend you purchase something else!"
5.0,Does the job.
5.0,Construction guys say these are their favorite!
5.0,Very satisfied.
5.0,These are the best insoles I've ever used. I love that they are made to fit and I don't have to cut them. Very comfortable. I use them in all my shoes.
5.0,Very comfortable. Felt relief on Achilles the moment I put my foot in the shoe with the insole. Easy to put in the shoe.
5.0,"I buy my shoes a half size larger so the insoles fit in the shoe with my foot comfortably.  These not a cure for plantar fasciitis but they really do help.  Alot.  I put a pair in my work boots, running shoes and hiking shoes and WOW what a difference!  If you're considering these to ease the pain of plantar fasciitis, go for it.  Stretch the calves often and thoroughly, keep a frozen water bottle in the freezer to roll your feet on after exercising and GET THESE INSERTS!  You won't regret it."
5.0,Boots were alittle big and these made them good and comfortable
5.0,Really work well
4.0,So far I had the for a week and they feel good.
5.0,Very very surprised at how well these fit
4.0,"Fairly rigid, much better than the usual over the counter orthotics."
5.0,"Comfortable, quick delivery, good value"
5.0,Solved the plantar fasciitis problem within a few weeks.
4.0,Great insole.
5.0,Feels good!!
5.0,Good support for my plantar fasciatious l.
4.0,"These fit perfectly in Sketchers Relaxed Fit shoes, size 13M.  I have tried them in both sport and casual shoes.  They provide a step below the maximum arch support of the Powerstep brand and work really well in shoes that already have some arch support built into the shoe itself (not the insert which you pull out to replace with this.)  They also really do help to relieve plantar fasciitus if you stick with them.  It took about 1 to 2 weeks for me with a milder case."
3.0,Fits in my shoes but add height to the point my feet come out of my shoes and or puts pressure on my toes and arch. They are only comfortable in my walking tennis.
5.0,Excellant
5.0,"Correct a much needed foot problem.  The doctor told me it would not be instant but they would work.  And work, they did!"
4.0,Very comfortable and good quality. Beats paying over $50 for same thing at podiatrist office.
5.0,Have not had any pain in my heel since wearing these in my shoes.
5.0,I used these orthotics immediately after receiving them.  And I absolutely loved them.  They fir perfectly and were a lot cheaper than the other insrts that I have.  I will definitely be buying more of these in the near future.
5.0,"Product just as described, I would do business again =)"
5.0,"Fantastic. I was going to throw away my hiking shoes, as I would come back with callouses and blisters. But these inserts have solved that problem."
5.0,I have used Powerstep insoles for several years on the recommendation of my foot doctor.  They do not disappoint.  This pair fit well and provided the support I needed when I went abroad and did a lot of walking.
3.0,It's supportive but thick from heel to toe. Can make fitting it into your shoe a challenge.
5.0,This is the only thing my husband can use as he is on his feet all day long... they are great
5.0,My doctor recommended these insoles. They are great for my plantar fasciitis. This is a great price compared to the shoe store that carries them locally.
5.0,I am happy that another customer that was reviewing another product mentioned these. They were exactly what I was looking for. These insoles fit perfectly in my work shoes. They are great for my heals and have great arch support. I stand and walk a lot at my job. It's been a week and my feet love them!
5.0,"These were suggested by my Foot Doctor, which he sold right out of his office but at a much higher price .  So I found them on here for half the price.  Not only do I get a great deal, but they work awesome for me!!  No more pain!!!  Love em'!!  "
5.0,"My job requires me to wear dress shoes every day.  No matter what shoes I buy, the soles are always thin and provide next to no cushion.  It was getting to the point where my knees were starting to ache.  These inserts fit perfectly into my dress shoes and since I started using them I noticed I my knee aches have gone away.  They provide great cushioning and arch support."
4.0,Fit my size 10 M shoes perfectly. Well made.
3.0,Not as much arch support as advertised.
4.0,Good product. I wish there was more arch support as I am very flat footed. I can't wear in one pair of my sneakers because it squeaks very loud when I walk. Make sure you have extra space in your shoes as they will raise your feet towards the top of the shoe. Great product otherwise
5.0,They are fine.  They help alot.
4.0,Worked well
4.0,These orthotics are perfect for my medium pronation.  My feet feel comfortable and supported while walking.
5.0,So far I have had these for less than a week now.  They feel great.  And the size 14-15 fit perfectly in my shoes (sketchers 14 4e).
5.0,"Bought these as a replacement for some older Superfeet. They are very comparable and seem to fit very well. They offer great arch support with very good comfort.

The price is very competitive, and I will likely get these again."
5.0,"These are awesome inserts.  My podiatrist recommend them and for the price, I've purchased several pair.  Was glad to see that Amazon carried them so now I can order when needed.  I pretty much replace every shoe liner I have with these inserts.  Helps with my pronating and gives me lift to keep my plantar fasciatis at bay."
5.0,"Perfect,  ridged enough for support,  but not hard and uncomfortable."
5.0,WOW!! Painful plantar faciitis reduced to dull ache after a week(with ice & stretching) Good arch support and cushioned heel cup.
5.0,This is my second purchase of this product . They are very comfortable. I love them!
5.0,"My husband has been having trouble with his feet going numb inside his shoes, so we tried a pair of these insoles.  He is feeling much more comfortable now! They are lifting up his arches and he is able to walk around in his shoes all day now."
2.0,Well my arch feels much better but have developed bilateral hip pain since wearing.  So guess it is back to the drawing board.
4.0,not to bad
5.0,"Just what I was looking for to help with my high arch. Yes, arch, singular which is where my problem comes in. I have a high arch on my right foot which results in metatarsal pain after running. This orthotic most definitely helped, however, I don't have a high arch on my left foot and so wearuing this in that shoe results in pain in that foot. If I leave the orthotic out, and just use the shoes insert I am running unevenly. I need a neutral insert to raise my left foot so that it is equal to the right foot with the orthotic. It would be nice if they sold these individually so that I could buy one for my right foot and another neutral insert for my left foot. Great for high arches, comfortable and fit like a glove. Just be warned that if you do not have issues with both feet, using this with the foot that does not require it may cause issues."
5.0,Helps my feet ... keeps my legs from fatigue
5.0,"Since I started using this brand of insoles in all my shoes, my plantar fasciitis has been non-existent.  Before I found Powerstep, I was miserable with the pain in my feet.  I am so thankful for these!"
5.0,Great insoles! They are stiff at first but the heel stability is incredible and it has alleviated some of the knee pains I get when continuously walking at work! I'm flatfooted and have these insoles in my size 9.5 converse all star hi-tops!
2.0,"Too bulky, I am afraid it will stretch my shoes due to it being too large and bulky."
5.0,The heel pain that I was having almost completely went away after I inserted the insoles. This is my third pair of insoles in the last 5 years. The second pair lasted much longer than they should have. I highly recommend these insoles for ANYONE dealing with heel pain of any kind.
5.0,I didn't want to buy another custom orthotic.  These were a good alternative and so far have worked well.
5.0,This is the second pair that I purchased and they work great for me.
5.0,Worked as needed.  Very supportive!
5.0,Perfect amount of cushioning and arch support! Fixes over pronation!
5.0,"Gives great arch support and realigns my foot perfectly! I always buy 4 at a time and use them in my everyday shoes, too."
2.0,"Will NOT be supportive for high arch, does not offer comfortable or sufficient padding. Very narrow, is not wide enough and I feel the edge around my toes. I returned unused, for prompt refund."
5.0,Great product! Great service!
5.0,Works ver well. Just a bit larger than expected and had to be trimmed.
5.0,The best over the counter insoles
5.0,Bought many different insoles that seemed to work well for a short time but wore out and needed replacement. These are the best in comfort so far and seem to be made to last much longer.
1.0,"So far, after one day - a failure.  Walked around Cosxco and a grocery store and feet were killing me.  A little too wide for my shoes with the insole out.  Looks like a possible good product.  Disappointed in my experience.  Will possibly give it another chance, but my Vionic shoes and Altra's feel great so far so if they fail, I won't be so hard on this product.  Fit perfect in my size 13 shoe."
5.0,awesome
5.0,LOVE IT !!
5.0,These are great products.  They really helped my feet and hold up well.
5.0,Well worth the money. They are better than any other insoles I have used in the past.
5.0,I've worn these insoles for years but this is the first time I've bought them on Amazon.  They fit just like the store bought and have not disappointed me.
5.0,Perfect fit for my sneakers. Relieves heel and foot pain. Good arch.
5.0,These insoles provide great support. My legs felt less tired after a day at work. They also helped relieve pain in my hip. I will be buying another pair.
5.0,Great price on an awesome product!
5.0,Excellent fit!
5.0,Wonderful helps the plantar faciatis
5.0,I have used this product for several years. They work very well for me.
2.0,"As much as I wanted these to work, they did not.  The heel height is too tall, and I constantly felt as though I was leaning forward.  I tried leaning back to compensate, but that didn't work and hurt my back.  They are made well, but simply didn't fit well."
5.0,"I had tried the harder powersteps and they need some break in period, but these were great immediately.  I have flat feet, and plantar fasciitis and these are comfortable and alleviate much of the discomfort with no break in."
4.0,"So far so good...
I have rheumatoid arthritis in my feet and (to me) it feels like the others' descriptions of plantar fasciitis.  The arch support in these insoles feel pretty good and I don't have the pain that I have been experiencing."
5.0,These things are seriously great. Very supportive and durable.
5.0,Third pair of these!!!! I love these insoles they support my arches and just make my size 14 feet feel so much better after being on my feet all day. I highly recommend thse
5.0,Made my back stop hurting good product.
5.0,"Perfect!
I've worn this insert for years and am very excited to find them available at a much lower price!"
5.0,just worn them a couple of times while playing tennis.  excellent support and comfortable.
5.0,"These insoles are great! The feel nice and cushiony, and they support my arches without overdoing it. Very comfortable. I don't know how much of an impact they're having on my plantar fasciitis, which for some reason began to improve just before I got them; but I'm hoping they'll help prevent reinjury."
5.0,"Have been using for years. Fit as expected, Last a long time and I'm on my feet 7am until 9pm with full time job (nursing) and family! Very happy with this product!"
5.0,Most comfortable insoles for work boots I have found.
5.0,"As long as I remember to buy these every 3 to 4 months I can keep my Plantar Fasciitis pain pretty much at bay. I have custom orthotics that I wear in my main shoes, but I keep these in my slippers, my gardening clogs, and other shoes. Considering shoe stores around here sell them for $60, I can afford to buy these when I need them from Amazon. They really help my knee and back pain, too."
5.0,Excellent! Better than my $300 custom orthotics.
1.0,"These are great with helping my heels spurs, BUT they only last about a month or less.  Then the layers peel apart and they're left unusable.  I wonder if they're a fake or if that's just what happens because other reviewers stated the same thing.  Either way, they're much too expensive to come apart so easily."
5.0,These offer excellent support.  Best I've tried yet.
4.0,Fits nicely
5.0,"I've had planters faciatis and these inserts along with prescribed home therapy have eliminated the pain. Also, there is no discomfort in my shoes. Good product."
5.0,They work great!!
5.0,good product
4.0,Great for my feet
4.0,These are pretty good inserts. They fit the bottom of my shoe well although they do cause my shoe to fit tighter as they are a bit bulky in my opinion.
4.0,Very comfortable.
4.0,"They fit my shoes perfectly (size 9.5). I have arthritis in my feet and while these help, I personally have better comfort with the Dr Scholls inserts for arthritis. But these are pretty comfortable for those who don't suffer from arthritis."
5.0,Third pair I have purchased.  They transform ill fitting shoes into something very comfortable to ware.
5.0,This is an excellent product. I plan to buy it again.
4.0,Good insoles. I have had them for 1 month and they stand up well to 12-hour shifts running about at the hospital. I have them in my plastic/composite shoes that i just wipe down when necessary; it's nice to be able to get insoles that are better for my feet in a convenient shoe.
5.0,"Just as described, very satisfied"
5.0,"Have purchased these in the past, good product for arch support."
4.0,Good productt
5.0,Worked as advertised. Helped my feet!
5.0,Fast service & great product!
5.0,My podiatrist turned me on to these. No more heel pain! Save your money for custom pieces until you try these first. I have four pairs and rotate them. You need to remove the foot pads from your shoes before you insert these.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for...perfect fit and adds a lot of comfort for exercising?
5.0,Great for plantar fasciitis!
5.0,I have bought about 5 pairs of these. I use them in all my shoes. Love that my feet don't hurt at work and I have used these in boots and dressy shoes as well.
5.0,"Great price,very good quality."
4.0,Put some pep in my step.
5.0,Comfy.
5.0,installed and fit fine (been using for years successfully)
5.0,"My husband is very happy with these. He put them in his tennis shoes and just like the other reviews said, they hurt his feet a bit at first. He only wore them two hours a day at first and then gradually worked up to all day in them. When he wears these he doesn't wake up with his feet hurting when he stands up them during the night. If he doesn't wear them, he is back to being in pain with his plantar fasciitas. Be sure to follow the instructions and you will have good results with these. We hope to get another pair soon for his other shoes."
5.0,I've purchased these before and they help my feet.
5.0,We've used this before. Wore the last ones out so I got a new pair. Excellent product!!
4.0,Worth the money
5.0,Put these in some work shoes and...ahhhhhh....comfortable!
5.0,the best
3.0,Box looked like it had already been open. Intruction were missing.
5.0,These feel great!!
4.0,Pretty good. Would have liked a higher arch support. Don't see any details of the search support among the different product models.
5.0,Fits well. Comfortable. Wear it for basketball and don't even notice it's there anymore.
5.0,Love these! Great comfort
4.0,I took the old insoles out of my shoes since they were worn so badly and put these in there.  They fit into my shoes perfectly and they are incredibly comfortable.  I spend a lot of my workday on my feet and with the previous insoles my feet would start to get tired and sore.  With these insoles that isn't the case.  This is a fantastic product.  Highly recommended.
5.0,Just throw then on today and they fit perfectly. Now let's see how good they work.....
5.0,very comfy wellmade too ty
5.0,I'm a very active person and have been wearing them for a week.  I have a flat foot and not much arch.  Totally took away the ache I was experiencing in my feet
5.0,"I have tried many different insoles, so far, these are the best,  Will purchase again when needed."
4.0,The fit well and look just like the originals.  I am deducting one star because they came in a plastic bag and not the original box.  What's up with that?  That always makes me a little suspicious.
5.0,Just as expected.
5.0,Very nice and definitely superior to the ones include even in higher end hiking or work boots that take a physical beating every day in the field.  Luv it!
5.0,"Excellent product
Works like a $450 orthopedic insoles"
3.0,Low quality but sometimes you get what you pay for.
5.0,My 'go-to' inserts. Love 'em
5.0,I absolutely love these. They fit to my shoe almost perfectly. The right one is slightly slightly smaller. Other than that they're amazing. They've helped so much.
5.0,"My feet were killing me after work every day. Bought these and my feet started to feel much better after just one day of using them. There's practically no pain after standing and walking around for seven to eight hours, and whatever pains or aches I do have feel better before the day is over. Great product, I hope it lasts a good, long while. Five stars from me."
5.0,Great inserts! Help my feet not hurt so much after long shifts!
3.0,I have one flat foot.... so I can only wear these for half a day.... my foot hurts too much.. The right foot is fine but when your job is standing for 8  hours a day....with just a 1/2 lunch ... my foot hurts when I have to stand in the same spot for hours.
4.0,Comfortable fit.
5.0,The insoles work great in my dog walking shoes.
5.0,My feet no longer hurt after 1 month - enough said - buy it!
4.0,They work! Not my first time purchasing these.
3.0,"Didn't fit or feel right in shoes, had to cut to fit but didn't want to do that. Sent back, did not get an exchange."
5.0,these are the best
4.0,"I recently purchased these orthotics on the recommendation of my podiatrist. I have plantar fasciitis and have been experiencing more foot pain lately, especially in my heels. I've only worn them for about a week, but have noticed a difference already. My foot feels more supported and my pain is a little less. I especially like the deeper heel on these orthotics. I'm hopeful that they will continue to relieve my pain with continued wear. I plan to purchase one or two more pairs, so I don't have to keep moving them from shoe to shoe. I think they're quite affordable."
5.0,These were recommended by my podiatrist & have really helped my arthritis pain.
4.0,"Helps with my heel pain, put these in my house slippers."
5.0,I don't go anywhere without them!
4.0,I originally purchased these for dress shoes but they are a little more bulky than expected. They fit perfectly in my sneakers!
4.0,"Only recently purchased, so can only address initial impressions. Fit if as expected and the insoles are comfortable, but I'd prefer some additional cushioning for the ball of the foot."
5.0,perfect
5.0,Quality product at a great price.
5.0,Love these 
5.0,Helping my husband's planter fasciitis
5.0,"Fit perfectly in my flat sneakers, but they are wider than a dress sho would be...the length was perfect.  Bought these for plantar fasciatis and received immediate relief..."
5.0,These are the best insoles I have found for plantar fasciitis.  Highly recommend and nice that they come in sizes and don't need to be cut to the appropriate length.
5.0,These make my tennis shoes the most supportive shoes I own.
1.0,Didn't work for me.
5.0,Fits perfectly and cheaper than the Doctors offices
5.0,"Buy these, don't go to the Good Feet Store.  Much less expensive and just as good to help your feet.  My podiatrist recommended them and they work."
1.0,Arch felt too far back
5.0,Used these for years. I have had heel spurs and they eventually have stopped the pain. I use them now out of habit.
5.0,perfect
5.0,These are the same that my podiatrist prescribed me...only a little cheaper & easier to get without paying for an office visit. I work 12 hour shifts & these orthotics are a must for my flat feet.
5.0,Love these insoles.  I work 12 hour shifts and these are saving my feet.  I've been having issues with pain in my heels and arches.  I found these are supportive and not to hard.  Amazon has the cheapest price I could find.
5.0,Great fit in any shoe and makes the day much more comfortable if you have flat feet.
5.0,perfect
3.0,"I was hoping these would add some good cushion to my shoes but they are very hard. Though I appreciate the arch support, they don't actually fit in any of my shoes without making them too tight. You would need a pretty large shoe to make these work."
5.0,good arch support--firm but not stiff
5.0,These really help to improve comfort and even the fit of my shoes
5.0,I wear 10 x-wide and this size fits perfect.  I have used these for years.  I have trouble with planters facetious.  I have tried others but these work best for me.
4.0,Good quality flexible Orthotic that fits as expected and provides moderate support and lots of coushion/comfort.
3.0,Very very hard. Thought they would be more cushion than hard. I was wrong. I have worn regular pro step inserts for years and thought I'd try these. I thought they would just be cushier versions of the regular inserts. I was wrong. Return was easy.
5.0,"These insoles are great in my work shoes! They also cost much less here ,rather than the shoe store where I'very been purchasing them!"
5.0,"The best there is, last for a ling time"
5.0,Got my new balance 1260's perfectly. Provides very noticeable support especially at my arches. I feel much more stable when using my does. They feel and look well made especially for the price paid.
5.0,It gives good arch support the arch does not give weight is firm I do use it in my sneakers and some boots. I would definitely buy this one again
5.0,"These inserts are just what I wanted. I use them to provide support for the boiled wool slippers I purchased in Norway and that I love. I sometimes wear the slippers all day (now that I am retired); While they are so comfortable the slippers lacked the needed support. With the inserts, they are now perfect! Thank you again Amazon--what would I do without you!"
5.0,Love them.
4.0,So far they work well. This is what should be used as an insole for expensive shoes to begin with.
5.0,The 7-7.5 fit my 7.5 athletic shoes great. I have had no problem moving from shoe to shoe. They do provide much better arch support for my high arches.
5.0,Great product that helps these flat feet of mine. Much cheaper here than at the local store I originally purchased these from.
4.0,Cut to size
5.0,"Worn for a week, and getting used to them. The molded in arches are tall, and absolutely relieve the heel from a lot of shock walking on concrete. Overall, I feel positive effects from using these, such as reduced ankle pain, and back pain."
5.0,"Good orthotics, adds cushion and arch support to shoes."
5.0,"Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics was recommended by a podiatrist to relieve pain in the base of my big toe.  She suggested I get them at a local ""Running Store"".  I went to the store and tried a pair to see what they felt like.  It felt strange and the salesperson gave me an explanation of how this corrects the way your foot is out of alignment.  I purchased a pair at the ""Doctor's discounted rate"" of $38.  When I got home, I went on Amazon and found the same thing for about $22.  I ordered them and returned the ones I had purchased in the store.  After the break-in period suggested by the salesperson (one hour the first day, two the second...until you reach four, and then you can wear them all the time) I found that it not only relieved the pain in my foot, but also helped with the bursitis in my hip.  Win, win!.  I just ordered a second pair so I can leave one pair in my work shoes and switch the second pair among my casual shoes.  Huge difference and well worth the price!"
5.0,I have flat feet and heel pain for walking too much and for my weight. This helps me a lot and it did alleviate the pain.
5.0,These have stopped the pain I was having on the ball of my foot.
5.0,Bought these for my husband. Happy they were the same as he buys at the pharmacy. Cheaper then the pharmacy. Happy with the product.
5.0,This are great....especially if you have plantar fasciatis.
5.0,These make a big difference!
5.0,"Out of all the insoles that I've purchased these are by far the best without have them custom made.  I have
tried SEVERAL brands with great disappointment.  I will continue to purchase the Power step.  They not only give
me the support that I need for may arch they also provide me with stability so my foot is stable.
They also have the cushion I need for my heel.  I will truly order these again."
5.0,very good arch support....take inserts out that come with shoes....make sure you get size for the shoe but it does fit just fine
3.0,These were way to long for my sz 6 foot. I had to cut over an inch off. They are also hard to place in the shoes I bought them for so as of yet I have not used.
5.0,"I've had them in use for over a year almost everyday. I weigh over 200lb to boot. These helped get rid of my plantar fasciitis. Every shoe, sandal, or slipper I put these in, make the fit and support perfect!  I will get these again.
Frank"
5.0,Fits perfectly in my winter boots. The support is exactly where it need it.
5.0,"The podiatrist was soaking me for $45 for a pair of these. Fit great, feel great!"
5.0,Have ordered these before and will again.  Very nice insoles.  Suggested by foot doctor years ago and have used and ordered from Amazon for years.
5.0,"Great support, right fit"
5.0,Would recommend these before orthotics.
4.0,It fits v well. My feet feel better.
2.0,The heel on these is way too low so I feel like I am standing back on my heels.  Very uncomfortable so I had to return them.  Amazon handled the return beautifully.
4.0,"I still use these everyday for work and love them. As with all insoles, you have to replace them after a while."
5.0,I play lots of tennis.  I have a pr. of Powersteps in all of my shoes.  I have had heel trouble in the past and don't ever want it again!
5.0,"I have been buying these insoles for years.  Ever since I started using them, I have not had any foot pain."
5.0,My husband works for an apartment management company as a special projects maintenance professional. He is on his feet for many hours a day in steel toe work boots. He like many others has a flat foot issue that was not to the point of  plantar fasciitis but still painful. The doctor recommended these to me for my plantar fasciitis and they helped me so much so we ordered some for him. He can wear them for up to a about 9 months before the wear it too much. The pictures show 1 year of wear.
5.0,this fits my women's size 10.5 PERFECTLY.
2.0,dont help very much
4.0,I have used this brand of insole for years and it has helped my knee and foot health.  I walked several miles every day.
4.0,"They are great except that even when I cut them a little shorter they still made my shoes tighter. Will have to cut them again I guess, but it will work out OK."
2.0,Let me start by saying that although these fit just a smidgen small I initially liked them for their support and comfort.  I wear them in my tennis shoes for arch support primarily. I do not run or exercise frequently and wear a suit and oxford's to my job so I actually only we were these on the weekends to basically walk around  or go to the mall.  In less than nine months of light use the right foot pad has completely worn out and these are now useless.  I have Superfeet  insoles in other shoes that are eight years old that have never worn out.  I spoke with Powersteps Customer Service dept and they told me that normal lifetime of these insoles is 6 to 12 months.  With these only lasting nine months of light use I cannot recommend them even though they're comfortable.
5.0,"Fits perfect, good quality, very strong arch support. My doctor recommended these, and I liked the first set so much I ordered another pair for my work shoes. I have used Doctor-Shoals (I think that's the name) in the past, they don't compare to these.."
5.0,"Second pair purchased. This brand was recommended by my podiatrist and were a better sea here on Amazon. I have plantar fasciitis in both feet and I overpronate, so that's insoles have helped with heel pain and foot fatigue from standing or walking!"
5.0,These make my shoes much more comfortable and I haven't had plantar fasciitis since I started using them. I got my original pair from a podiatrist. These are the same thing and much less expensive!
5.0,"Nice, I like them!"
5.0,"These orthotics fit my need perfectly. They are comfortable and supportive, so I purchased a second pair so I would not be forced to move them to my alternate pair of shoes."
5.0,So far I like them really well.
5.0,"I developed plantar fasciitis many years ago, and my podiatrist recommended these. Within two days, my feet were back to normal, and I have not had a recurrence. They are now in all my shoes. Everyone is different, but these did the trick for me. I highly recommend them."
5.0,"Very Comfortable! They took a little getting used-to, but after a few weeks I felt a noticeable difference in the way my back felt after a long serving shift. Definitely recommend to people in the restaurant business, but you probably need to get your work shoes a half size bigger if you plan to use these inserts as they can make shoes feel too tight."
5.0,I bought the same item at a Podiatrist office last year and paid $85 a pair for them.  They really helped my feet issues.
5.0,I wear these in all my shoes and boots. My feet are a wreck from abuse. These make everything better. Pain free when I have these in. Thanks.
5.0,Great fit super support for plantar fasciitis
5.0,These orthotics sre great.  My feet haven't felt this good in months.  The size is just right and the arch support is too.  I can wear them in both my work oxfords as well as tennis shoes.  Great job.
5.0,The best insert around.
5.0,"I'm delighted with these. I've bought several pairs. Comfortable and very easy to insert in any of my shoes. I'm so relieved to find these. I had been buying a product from my podiatrist office, and they closed up. I couldn't find that brand anywhere on the Internet or locally. I can get 3 of these, for what I paid for one pair from the podiatrist, and they are better made. Yeah!"
5.0,Went right into my shoes and felt great.
3.0,it was smaler than expected. wish I can get one size larger
5.0,Fantastic !  Stopped my heal pain a most have for work boots.
3.0,Helps with my plantar fasciitis.
2.0,"This is my 6th pair and they are the best thing ever for my plantar fasciitis and resultant neuromas. Unfortunately, the ones I ordered from SmartDestination must be seconds as they kill my feet. The hard plastic insert rubs on the outside edges of my feet. I am unable to exchange them as I waited one day too late to use them in my walking shoes."
5.0,I bought these for my wife. She finds them better than the $600 set that she got from her podiatrist. Excellent quality product. I have ordered a second pair
5.0,The Powerstep insoles were forty percent less on amazon than at an local retailer that I shopped at. I am very pleased with the purchase. John
5.0,Enabled me to walk pain free again.  I have been quail hunting with them and they have been great. Recently ordered a second set and have recommended them to a friend.
5.0,"These insoles are fabulous! My feet used to hurt so bad after standing most of my day, now my feet hurt less and same with my lower back! I've gotten many pairs over the last 3 years for all my sneakers and boots."
5.0,Been using these for years.  My cheap ass hasn't bought new shoes in a long time because these make old new again!
5.0,Love this product feel great and I wil re order more
5.0,Really gives my feet the help they need!  Support is great & my feet feel much better at the end of the day.  They are a little pricey but worth every penny!
5.0,Some of the best arch supports I have used yet.  Good cushioning and fit well in shoe.  My go to pair.
5.0,perfect and awesome!
1.0,"These were so uncomfortable, were too high so that my foot hardly fit into my boot anymore, the arch was too far back. I bought these for a trip to Japan where I walked an average of 23,000 steps a day. Wound up not wearing the boots that I was planning to wear at all because these insoles were so uncomfortable. I'd want a refund."
5.0,These are amazing. I just came off a 24-hour rotation and my feet never felt tired. I need these in ALL my shoes!
5.0,I've been using this product for years in my walking/running shoes to help support my feet.  They work well.
5.0,I purchased these to put in my Dansko clogs. The fit was perfect and they are more comfortable than the XP inserts that were originally in the shoes. Will definitely buy again when these wear out
5.0,Feel good on the feet
5.0,Great
5.0,Perfect. Love it!
4.0,good
5.0,"I have some good New Balance running shoes that still looked good.  However, my feel always hurt when running.  I tried to salvage my shoes a little by buying some new insoles.  I must say, it's like I have brand new shoes!  In fact, it even feels better!  The arch support is amazing and my feet don't hurt when i'm done.  I only run about 2 or 3 miles, but with these, maybe I can run a few more.  Nahh......."
5.0,My favorite of all insoles and I've tried them all!
5.0,Very good insoles
5.0,I tore a tendon in my ankle and these have helped provide arch support and keep the ankle properly aligned. I have 3 pairs.
5.0,"I was suffering from heal pain, Doctor suggested to use for insoles. I did some research and brought this product. With in two days I could see lot of difference in my heal. Regularly started using this insoles. After a month I don't see any pain in my heal. Thanks for good reviews"
5.0,My wife suffers from bunions because of her flat feet and these are helping her pains a lot. She had surgery for her bunions but one of her feet is starting to be painful again as the doctor tat did he surgery for that foot didn't remove enough bone excess. But these insoles are perfect for her. She has a set made by prescription and they are absolute garbage compared to these.
5.0,After trying many different kinds of insoles I finally found one that works for me.
5.0,Helped ease my plantar fasciitis.
5.0,Very comfortable and excellent fit. My size is narrow and it helps stabilize my foot in shoes. Great for over-pronators.
5.0,Love the wonderful arch support these insoles offer my shoes.
5.0,This is my third pair. They are great
5.0,My Dr recommemded them for my hip problem. They certainly make staying on my feet all day more comfortable!
5.0,Way better than the standard units
5.0,Love these.  They have saved my feet from plantar fasciitis pain.  I bought 2 pairs.
4.0,"The arch is quite firm, and it takes some getting used to until they are broken in. I have to loosen up my laces to get them to fit more comfortably, and this is after removing the old insoles - as stated in the directions. So, they are noticeably thick and cushy. I am getting some relief from a heel spur by using these insoles.

I average about 2-3 miles a day on concrete, walking only to and from work, and manage to wear out insoles within a year, where good shoes last me 2-3 years if I can replace the insoles periodically. These are some of the better insoles I have found."
5.0,Great orthotics would recommend! Thank you
3.0,Aggressive arch support.
5.0,I bought these for around the house support in my crocks and they are terrific !!
5.0,Just what I needed.
5.0,These really work. My feet use to ach all the time after work. Not anymore. I recommend this to anyone having arch and tendon pain.
5.0,I'm going to get some more.
5.0,I have flat feet and these orthotics have really helped. They have replaced the old insoles in my NewBalance shoes and I can definitely feel the extra arch support.
5.0,I've used these insoles for years and they make it possible for me to keep walking.
5.0,"Love these, my doctor recommended I get them and my foot pain is so much better"
5.0,"This is a great orthodic! The arch support is ideal and makes walking around and standing so much more bearable. I think it's also helped me with my lower back pain, if that's possible. If I walked around for too long I would get back pain but lately it's gone away. I don't know if it's these orthotics that's releaving the pain, either way they're great."
5.0,Fantastic support for the arches and with great cushioning. I use it in my daily walking shoes.
5.0,Buy these instead of those in the store.
5.0,"Love them, so comfy"
5.0,Transformed my day at the ski hill!
5.0,Delivered as promised.
5.0,feel good inserts
5.0,These orthotic insoles are the best. I have them in several pairs of my shoes.
5.0,"I have ordered several products from this company, and have gotten enormous relief. Thank You Pinnacle Powerstep ."
5.0,My feet feel so much better with these insoles!  Makes walking pain free!
5.0,These were recommended by a podiatrist that I work with and they are phenomenal. Using them for plantar fasciitis
5.0,These are the best for any type of foot problems.  I remove the insoles from even my most expensive running/walking shoes and replace them with these.  My feet and legs do not tire as much when using them.
5.0,these are the best orthotics for the money
3.0,not great not bad. eh.
5.0,"Great product! I can not believe I was so foolish to purchase $400 custom inserts from my podiatrist for my plantar fasciitis. These are just as good for 1/20th of the cost and I don't have to worry about trying to wear them to the ground, just buy a new pair once these show a sign of wear."
5.0,Great for plantar fasciitis
5.0,Arch support has been answer for several of us with woes such as plantar fasciitis and painful knees.
5.0,Very good! Helped my feet feel much better
5.0,Excellent for support
5.0,Great shoe inserts!
5.0,My podiatrist prescribed these for me to help with healing my plantar fascitis.  They're very comfortable and a great price.
5.0,outstanding.  great support.  really happy.  made an old pair of shoes feel like new again.
5.0,"V.A. Pediatrist recommended these when I told him that my feet were hurting after tennis matches on hard courts.
Got a pair for my tennis shoes and tried them for a few weeks and the foot pain went away. Was so pleased that I bought more pairs and now wear them in virtually every pair of shoes. You have to remove the thin original shoe insoles so the shoes don't get to tight from using these.  Also great for use at trade shows where standing on hard floors all day. I told a friend with planters fasciytis and he found them being sold at a local running shoe store. The store told him that they won't sell running shoes without a pair of these insoles. He bought a pair and tried them and is back playing competition tennis again."
5.0,These help my feet tremendously. The best 'over the counter' orthotic I've ever used.
5.0,As Expected.  Second time buying them.
5.0,"I have tried many, many orthotic inserts, trying to find a replacement for the custom molded ones that my insurance no longer pays for.  These are the best so far, ... by a good measure!  They take care of the plantar fascia issues just like the custom molded inserts.  Love them, and plan to buy more so I can have them in all my shoes.  For about $25 they accomplish what a $400-500 insert does - for me anyway.  The arch on these is quite high and firm, with good cushioning all around, and a comfortable surface material.  Good quality."
5.0,"They provide good support, feel good - Love them!"
5.0,I put these in a pair of boots that had zero cushion and were unwearable after two hours. These made a world of difference! I can now wear the boots all day long. They provide all the support and cushion that the boots were lacking.
5.0,"If you suffer low back pain or knee pain I recommend giving these a try. I own 6 pair and leave them in my shoes or swap around. These changed my life. I suffered from low back pain my whole life. After an injury a podiatrist recommended these to me because of my natural high arch in my feet. That was in 2011, I started putting these in all my shoes and I haven't had back pain since. Give it a shot. Your comfort is worth the minimal price."
5.0,These are good insoles
5.0,Excellent orthotic. Not too severe yet supports feet well. Might take a while to get used to if you have not worn them before.
4.0,Seem to fit correctly and provide missing support.
5.0,"These Orthotics reallywork.  Had a heal spur and since using these, have not had any recurrence of it."
1.0,"Hospital work shoes. 3/ 12 hour shift per week. Not worn any other time. Bought March 29, 2016 . Today December 14, 2016 look at the photo"
5.0,I have just replaced all of my old boots and shoes with larger sizes that will fit these orthotics. I purchased two of them and may buy more. It has nearly solved my foot/arch pain. :)
5.0,Fast shipping and these are the most comfortable insoles I've ever had. Thanks
4.0,I've bought these before for ankle pronation. These seem to help tremendously. You may need to buy shoes a size bigger.
5.0,"Have been wearing this insole for 2 weeks, it really minimizes my plantar fasciitis, good relief for my feet."
5.0,Really help my feet. Love them.
5.0,these inserts are very good.
5.0,I've used these inserts for several years now; they hold up well with everyday use. I wear a size 6.5 shoe and the 6-6.5 inserts fit perfectly.
5.0,Fast delivery and great product.
4.0,"I like the texture, but a little to thight with shoes. I will order the same brand but the 3/4."
5.0,perfect
5.0,"I have plantar fasciitis and have trouble finding good shoes in my town.  I wanted some good supports I could interchange in my shoes.  I read a lot of reviews, and settled on these supports.  They are as described!  They fit in my tennis shoes, but not in my dress shoes.  They are very comfortable.  I wear wide width shoes, and these are just a tad narrow for my shoes, not my feet, but I read someone secured theirs with sticky back velcro, so I gave that a shot, and it works beautifully keeping the inserts in place.  These are budget friendly and a great product."
4.0,Highly recommend!
5.0,Help feet feel good even after s long day
4.0,I believe that only time or surgery will cure plantar faciitis. But these inserts have relieved quite a bit of the pain.
1.0,There is not warranty to try the product. You don't know if they'll help you or not. They are expensive and it didn't help me. Think twice before you get them.
5.0,My 4th or so pair over the last 7+ years.  They last about 2 years.
5.0,I purchased these as a gift as the receiver liked them.
5.0,"This was my second pair, they could be a little more durable but they do help with plantar fasciitis pain."
5.0,I have removed the existing insoles on my most commonly used shoes and replaced them with Powerstep Orthotics.  These insoles plus regular stretching and exercises have eliminated my foot problems.
5.0,So far so good.  Seems to be helping after four days of use.
1.0,"after a few hours using these, my feet were killing me. would never buy again"
4.0,helps get rid of plantar fasciitis
5.0,Awesome
3.0,I don't feel they are better than other inserts for the same price.
5.0,I've been using these for several years and get a pair for each new pair of shoes I buy. I have high arches and these really make a difference.
5.0,Great orthotics! Helps my knee pain.
4.0,My son liked them.  They helped quite a bit.
5.0,I love these insoles
4.0,They are helping with my issues so great.
1.0,"These insoles felt really comfortable, the size was perfect (I'm a size 9 women's), and it could probably fit in almost any shoe. The problem is when I stepped on the insole, the arch fell completely flat. I couldn't believe it- zero arch support. I have what's called a flexible flat foot so I bought it for the arch support. These insoles did absolutely nothing for me, so I sent them back. The search continues. Hope this helps."
5.0,They work - they keep pressure on the arch which has improved things over several days to the point that everything feels completely normal. Also check out exercises for plantar facilitis  which include some stretching of feet and some calf stretches and raises. They all complement one another. I will keep using as a means of maintaining the situation. It's easy to change from shoe to shoe or get a couple more for shoe rotation.
5.0,Very happy
5.0,Fit perfectly in my sneakers extending the wear.
5.0,These inserts are wonderful. I'm on my feet all day and they make my walking and standing much more comfortable. No more sore feet. I even purchased some for my daughter who is also on her feet all day.
5.0,Love these
5.0,great product
5.0,Excellent help for sore feet/flat feet/ arches
5.0,These inserts have helped my plantar fasciitis pain
4.0,I have used this brand and they are very good.
5.0,Great fit and support. Only ones i buy and i buy a new one with every new shoe.
3.0,"Great for the first month I had them, but after that I had worn them out. I had to go buy a different pair within 45 days of ordering these insoles."
5.0,These are the only inserts that work for my feet. I work retail and am pounding the concrete for eight hours a day! My feet have been much better after getting these.
5.0,"These are a Christmas gift for my husband and I have heard great things about them, so I expect them to be perfectly fine all the way around."
5.0,These work great!  They do alleviate the very painful symptoms of Plantar Facitis and that is why I needed to get them!!  Was in so much pain!! Must rip out Insoles to use. Use in my tennis shoes. Thanks!!
4.0,"I bought these not quite a year ago and have been pleased with them except that they are getting worn out. I have them in a pair of shoes that I wear about 1/4 of the time. They are still doing their job but both insoles have large wear holes were my big toes touch them. One of the heels also has a wear hole. The instep portion of one insole is starting to break down. The insoles are still serviceable but probably for not much longer.
I do like these insoles, I just wish they would hold up better. I have custom made leather insoles I bought 20 years ago and they have years of life left. Perhaps I am expecting too much. Any comments on that would be appreciated."
5.0,Awesome!! Put these in my work shoes and I love them
5.0,I wear these in all of my shoes.
5.0,I love them!
5.0,had to trim a bit
5.0,Have used these for several years now and still happy with them and the price on Amazon is unbeatable.
3.0,"I guess I wasn't planning on how thick they are... took up too much of my shoe, pushed my foot up too high inside and made it too tight to wear... I gave mine away to someone that had too sloppy and large of a work boot... {{sigh}}"
5.0,No more sore feet!  Great product
5.0,Very impressed. Quickly recovered from painful plantar fascitis when I started wearing these.
4.0,"I buy these for my son, because his feet turn in.  They are great."
5.0,"Really provided comfort for my feet. Insoles didn't fit into all my shoes,otherwise it was easy to walk  once I wore them.
 Good support all day."
5.0,"I'm going to buy these again!!!  For those with higher arches like me, these are right on.  And, they ship fast.  Thanks!!!"
4.0,Very supportive but a bit big in my size 12 wide shoe.
5.0,"These really help the comfort of my shoes.  I first tried them when I went into a good quality shoe store and they did an analysis of my feet and how I walk to determine which inserts would be best for me.  These are the ones and they are the perfect fit.  I think I cut down the sides on my last pairs because they are lower than these new ones, but they seem to be comfortable without being trimmed, so I won't do that again.  I had that pair for about 8 years and they finally got little holes in the heel.  Remember to remove your original insoles from your shoes before putting these in.  They are designed as a replacement sole, not to go on top of what is in there.  Maybe certain types of shoes you could do that with, but not tennis shoes."
5.0,Great product as usual!
4.0,"Nice fit, good cushioning effect, very comfortable."
5.0,"After seeing a podiatrist I was told I had a falling arch, but after reviewing x-rays an insert might be all I need for the time being. I was recommended the Powerstep Pinnacle and was told it would take getting to. After a few days of noticing the insert I hardly notice it and am no longer having foot pain."
5.0,"LOVE this product. Good-bye foot-pain!
Gonna get more for all my shoes!"
5.0,"My feet love me right know ,need to get more for all my shoes."
5.0,good product.
5.0,These were recommended by my foot doctor.  They are great!!! The best arch support and for all of my shoes.
5.0,"I have a fused ankle that puts tons of pressure on the ball, middle and behind my little toe of my foot. Theses have helped so much! They provide tons of cushion to relieve pain while still allowing my foot to have breathing room in my shoe. You will love theses! Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Easy to purchase, fit as expected.  Holding up well."
5.0,Great product!  Have several pairs.
5.0,My husband loves them and helps his heel pain.  Thank you for a great product!
5.0,"These have worked well for my plantar fasciitis. It's not cured, but has helped. I wish they had a higher arch, but they are doing what they are intended to do. Some others have complained about the durability. I've had them for about 5 months, and they are just fine. I would expect they will easily last past 1 year of ownership (and I wear them every single day).
Minus 1 star because I wish the arch was a little higher, but that's personal preference.
*Update*
I have now used these insoles for about 1.5 years. When I buy a pair of shoes, I throw away the insoles and use only these; so I have literally worn them every day for 1.5 years, and they are still going strong. I assume I'll have to purchase a new set in 6 months or so as I am seeing some signs of wear. Overall, I am very happy with these. Of note, my plantar fasciitis is gone. what a wonderful thing that is too because it made it difficult to walk for several months."
5.0,"great product, as advertised."
5.0,"These orthotics help my plantar fasciitis and fit perfectly in my shoes. My feet do not feel fatigued after standing all day. I highly recommend them. I have several pair, put them in all my shoes, and I will continue to order them as needed."
5.0,Better than the cheaper insoles I have bought in stores. Hold up over time.
4.0,Saved my feet after countless hours as a server
5.0,These are really great...they make your feet smile!
5.0,"Best non-custom orthotics on the market.  Very durable.  I have flat feet, bone spurs and periodically suffer from plantar fasciitis.  The arch is in the perfect location, offers amazing support, and the heel has just the right amount of cushioning.  They are the reason I can walk any distance without aching feet."
5.0,worked as described. Took pressure off arch
4.0,"These FINALLY have relieved my plantar fasciitis and heel pain better than anything else - other orthotics, doctor visits, injections, taping, boots, etc. It says they're for ""mild pronation"" - I have a fairly high arch and normally wear neutral running shoes, but I found even with liners out most ""neutral"" orthotics were pushing my foot too far to the outside. These are working well for me. Padding is excellent, arch support is adequate, and the heel cup keeps the heel from getting further irritated by moving around.."
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,"My favorite shoes are a pair of vintage Frye boots (from 1980 to be exact!).  However, they are not always the most comfortable for long wearing periods.  The sole, being leather, is a bit on the hard side and provides no cushioning or support.  I have tried a few inserts through the years and was generally unimpressed.

These though, dang!  When I put my foot in my boot with these I could tell that this was something special.  I need a little metatarsel support in the form of a bit of lifted arch support on the inner side of my food.  I have custom inserts but they never quite work with these boots.  These work in the way that I wish my $200 custom orthotics did with these boots.

The boots in question have a 1 3/4 inch heel.  While my orthotics work sublimely in flat shoes but just not in my coveted Frye boots.  This worked with my heeled Frye boots and I could not be any more pleased with them."
4.0,4 stars
5.0,Great product. I paid triple the price on an insole for PF at a foot/shoe specialty store and this one is excellent. I recommend this product highly.
5.0,"Just so y'all know, I'm not inclined to rate 5 stars on anything I buy here.  At the time I bought this product I also bought 5 other types.  My  feet were really hurting and I could hardly walk!!  Make a long story short, I tried them all and this bad boy was by far the best of them all.  Fact is, it almost cured my Planter's condition!!  Now when I get up in the morning my feet still hurt but at least I can still walk to the rest room!  And when I put my shoes on, wow, no more pain.  I wear them in my sneakers and other soft sole shoes - did not try them on hard sole business shoes. Also I don't wear thick socks with them - I wear shoe liners or very thin socks.  At lunch time I go walking for about a mile and they work great.  Also I walk at the Flea Market for hours. This morning I ordered another 2 pairs for my other shoes.  I ordered the first pair early Sept and now its late Nov and they are wearing great.  Funny thing is, I tried these last!!  I used the other types up until a month ago by random selection.  Also, I don't tape my feet or do foot exercises and the gadget I bought to relieve Planter's is now under my coffee table collecting dust. Best advise I can give is to buy several type shoe inserts to find the one that works for you and you can start with this one."
5.0,Fixed my planter fasciitis immediately!
5.0,My foot doctor recommended these arch supports. I am pleased with the fit in my walking shoes.
5.0,Very comfortable!
5.0,"Just had them for a week, so far so good. I do feel a difference now,them seem to he working and my feet don't hurt as much."
5.0,"Support and great construction.  Took a while to get use to. My back actually feels better after wearing them.
Simple effective solution !"
5.0,My first time trying these inserts.  I have $500. inserts from my doctor that I hate.  These powerstep orthotics (blue) are perfect.  They fit my shoe  exactly.  I stand on my feet all day at work and it just got easier!
5.0,"I bought these for a co worker after noticing his feet hurting while he walked. I was told he had no insoles and could no afford any extra expence so after I found out the size he needed I decided to surprize him with this gift. Wow, he couldn 't thank me enough. By the end of the day he was smiling something he hasn't done in some time.
Very satified with Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics, the smile in his face says it all."
4.0,My morning heal pain has been dissipating since I started using these.
5.0,"Great shoe inserts.  Takes a few days to ""break them in"" but the time is well spent.  During the break in period the insoles are rathe still but after about a week of everyday wear, they and your feet have become one with one another and the wear experience is pure joy.

I will buy again when these wear out."
5.0,"They are great but I cut them. I thought that you cut them to your size. HA!  HA!
Yes now I can't use them because the arch part in the middle is now almost to my big toe.  So just in case your as smart as I am ,read before you buy something and make sure your wide awake. 
Other than that they are very comfortable. I usually buy super feet and these just may be more comfortable."
4.0,Apparently my arches are not symmetrical so I only wear one in my right shoe - but it solved my foot ache problem when I run.
5.0,I like them
5.0,"Excellent product recommended by my podiatrist.  The inserts have improved my life so much. I have gotten relief from constant heel pain (spurs, tendinitis and planter fasciitis) it's a miracle for my feet.  These Pinnacles are a bit less money and a bit less cushioned than the Powerstep Pro but I got these Pinnacles for a pair of shoes I wear around the house. The Pros cushioning made that shoe too snug.  I buy the Pros for walking, shopping etc.  I have always had foot problems and wore custom made orthotics for about 20 years but finally gave up on them.  I was reluctant to try another orthotic, but so delighted I did.  Prior to using Powerstep I was so discouraged and thinking I would need surgery.  Powerstep has been a blessing to me."
4.0,Excellent product for flat feet
5.0,Man these things are good.  I put them in an older pair of Sperry shoes and they feel incredible.  These will make your dress shoes feel like tennis shoes.
5.0,"For my plantar fasciitis these are the best.  And the least expensive!  I purchased these for about $23 and just noticed as I'm trying to order more the price has increased. Of course!  I've tried super feet green and orthaheel relief full size, both pricey.  These feel like I have a bit more arch support from front to back.  And the heel is a bit more cushiony.  I compared them while wearing one of each."
2.0,"Not sure about other styles offered, but this style made all of my shoes too snug to fit comfortably - especially in the toe area. I plan to return these and try a different model."
5.0,I think these have really helped with my heel pain.  I have a high arch and the support with these insoles is great.  Plus the extra cushioning helps.
5.0,"My foot pain actually disappeared the instant I put my shoes back on, new inserts in place. I could not believe how long and intensely I suffered, only to discover I never had to."
5.0,So far they have been effective and comfortable for a heel spur
5.0,Immediate relief on the .bottom of my foot.
4.0,"I purchased these to help with a neuroma I have in my foot (basically a bundle of nerves in my toes that get really, really sore from wearing closed toed shoes or walking a lot). They were AMAZING for this and I had absolutely zero neuroma pain after walking about 8 hours on cobblestone streets in Florence. However, they are a little bit thick and I did have a ton of pain from the multiple gigantic blisters that resulted from my feet rubbing against the tops of my shoes, an issue I have never had with the shoes I was wearing before. I don't think these are any thicker than most insoles, so it may be a bit unfair to dock a star for this, but I ended up pulling them out discreetly on a side street when I could barely walk from the blisters and tossed them in a garbage can."
4.0,Definitely helping my foot pain. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it's too early to tell how durable they will be.
5.0,The Powerstep line of insoles is top notch. One has to understand what type of issues they are having with their feet so they can choose which product to buy. I have mild pronation and ordered these Orthotics-U Blue and they have corrected the metatarsal pain issues in my feet very well. I started out with the basic style years ago and liked their solid construction and feel. They were to correct plantar pain and did the job. Never had to replace them in many many years.
5.0,These inserts fit my foot perfectly and give me much needed comfortable arch support.
1.0,The arches are to high so it made my heels hurt more.
5.0,"I got these at the recommendation of my foot doctor for my foot pain, they work great."
1.0,Returned as these were very large...did not help with supination actually felt like they would increase my issue
5.0,Great for the feet!
5.0,The insoles fit great! A very Nice relief for my feet
1.0,"This item was a terrible insert. It was too large to come even close to fitting into any of my shoes. Yet, it was rated as suitable for ""athletic"" shoes. When I went to ""trim"" it as the instructions recommended, the process revealed a white plastic insert that would eventually shred my foot. I do not recommend this insert unless you have a cobbler on hand and want to place these into combat boots."
5.0,My husbands feet felt so much better after 2 days. Great support. Will def reorder.
5.0,I have been buying this brand for over 6 years. A+
5.0,"Very good, comfortable with plenty of support."
4.0,So far so good!  Though they do squeak when you walk.
5.0,Great support
5.0,"I was able to slip these right into my sneakers with no problem. I noticed a difference right away.
Comfort and arch support are important to me because I have Planters fascitis  and these are great.
My feet don't hurt after I take a walk. I love them and would buy them again."
5.0,Fit good. Feel great.
5.0,Great product at a great price
5.0,"I got these to play indoor tennis over winter on hard courts.  They are great!  My feet don't hurt after playing, as well as my back.  Normally playing on hard courts would wreck my back and also stir up my plantar fasciitus, but not with these inserts. Get them!"
5.0,really comfortable!
3.0,Arches were too high for my feet. Very uncomfortable.
3.0,It feels like there is a big lump of something under my arch. It is hard to get used to it having that big lump feeling. I am searching for an alternate.
5.0,"great fit,  i work in a restaurant, so i'm on my feet all day, and these seriously help with my feet!!!"
5.0,"Great product and a great price. Local places that sell these are more expensive. Since these are an everyday accessory, getting the product we need  for a great price is so nice."
5.0,"Perfect for my golf shoes, walking shoes and loafers.  Helped me get past my plantar facilities.  Have four pair.  Keep them in all of my enclosed shoes."
1.0,Can't insert in shoes. Too large
4.0,use these all the time
5.0,"I am a long-time wearer of Powerstep Pinnacle orthotics, so wearing them all day every day is not an issue for me.  I replace my orthotics about once a year or as needed. They work well for me."
5.0,"I work retail, on my feet all day. These insoles help a lot. I will buy more."
5.0,They  are wonderful
5.0,They feel very good and make my feet feel much better.
5.0,"Must have, these are great for your feet."
4.0,So far they are fairly new but I do like the feel and they do tighten up  a loose fitting pair of shoes and make them feel good.
5.0,"I ordered these Powerstep Pinnacle insoles for arch support.  They arrived quickly.  I ripped out the insoles of a pair of walking shoes, then easily slipped the Powerstep insoles in place.  They work like a charm providing all day comfort when previously my feet would start barking after a couple hours.  I will order these for every pair of shoes which need them.  Why mess around with foot pain?"
5.0,Been using for some time.  Have a pair for all my shoes.  If you have plantar fasciitis or a pronation problem then these are what you need
5.0,"I started using these years ago when diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and got great relief.  I found I had to start slowly, one or two hours each day, but now use them all day.  And my foot problems are gone.  This particular pair is for my husband.  He uses them in his work boots.  He found his feet have felt much better at the end of the day.  Good product."
5.0,These are great and last a long time!
5.0,These are the best orthotics I've ever used (and I've tried many) and you can't beat this price.
3.0,"Good for mild arch support, but not for plantar fascitous."
5.0,"get it if your feet hurt, helped me a lot"
5.0,These Powerstep pinnacle orthotics provide the arch support needed.  Will buy again.  Highly recommend.
4.0,"I'm pleased with the orthotic & have it in my athletic shoes. I can feel the difference in walking, but I believe they would even be better in shoes with a deeper heel cup."
4.0,I put them in my golf shoes so I only have them on for 4 to 5 hours.  They seem to work fine.
5.0,These orthotics are about the only thing that keep my feet from hurting.
4.0,have been using these for several years. They keep me out of surgery for plantar faciitis for the time being.
5.0,I'm very happy with these they work well for me. I recommend them.
2.0,"I was very disappointed with these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics as they were very uncomfortable in my shoes.  They raised my toes up so high that they rubbed against my shoe and it was quite painful.  I only kept them on about 2 hours as that is all I could stand.  Unfortunately,  they are going back.  Oh well, the search is still on...."
5.0,I have terrible arches.  My feet hurt if I don't wear these.  I've tried several others and these are the ones.  I'm on my feet all day and these work.  I've tried the extreme ones (red) and they weren't as comfortable.  I have 4 or 5 pairs that I rotate.
5.0,By using these inserts in all my shoes I have eliminated the heel pain I was experiencing when walking
5.0,Great insoles
1.0,Too uncomfortable to wear with any shoes. I don't know how people wear these. We really wanted them to work.
5.0,Great fit! Exactly what I needed for work due to my prolonged standing and walking. Foot pain and back pain went away once I started wearing these insoles.
5.0,Excellent products at a fair price and quick delivery.
5.0,"Perfect fit, hope it help my plantar fasciitis."
4.0,Took away foot pain
5.0,"These are by far the most comfortable inserts I have used! I have flat feet and plantar faciitis, as well as posterior tibial tendinitis. These inserts have helped with the pain more than even custom orthotics. I highly recommend these inserts."
5.0,Works as advertized. Helping to lessen pain related to planters Fasciitis.
5.0,The Powerstep inserts sure help my feet from aching after a long day in construction!
4.0,"The Pinnacle version of Powerstep is really comfortable.  I also have the Powerstep Journey and while the Pinnacle doesn't have as much arch support, the do feel more comfortable when wearing them all day.  The one flaw with these insoles is the have a horrible squeak when I walk.  It's really noticeable when its quite or I'm in my house. When your out and about it's less noticeable because of background noise, but it's still there.  The other versions of Powerstep do not squeak, so I think it's just the material of the Pinnacle version."
5.0,"I wish they weren't so expensive, but I'm not sure I can ever go back to Dr Scholls again. Best support I've found so far for my Plantar Fasciitis condition."
5.0,"Excellent insert, supportive and long- lasting."
5.0,These insoles saved me this summer! I searched for shoes that I could walk miles a day in at work and could find anything for a couple years. I bought these insoles and some crock-type clog shoes and my feet pain from years went away. I put them in any shoe it fits and they are wonderful.
5.0,Been using these for years and love them!
5.0,I had to cut them down to fit my shoes but they are the best arch support insoles ever.
5.0,"Can't run without these, I have a high arch and they are a life saver"
5.0,Excellent product and value!
5.0,"I've spent a lot of money on others, but have found myself always going back to ""Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics""!"
5.0,Only way I can walk for long periods.
5.0,"These are my second pair! I love the great support from arch to heel, with a little cushion for the entire foot."
5.0,I have a heel spur so I purchased this Powerstep Insoles and the heel pain is alleviating.
4.0,They fit and give me heel support but feels like walking on a big marble. Arch support
5.0,I had a bout of plantar fasciitis a few years ago. I did physical therapy and stretches at home and started wearing these inserts in my shoes. Eventually the issue went away but I still wear these everyday in my shoes and have not had any pain return.
4.0,Great product!
5.0,We have used these inserts for years.  They provide great support.
3.0,I find them to thick for my shoes.  I am  trying them in an old pair of running shoes since they are to clunky for all of my other shoes.  I hope I will get to like them better!
2.0,"I have purchased several pairs of these over the years and loved them.  My most recent pair wore out in 27 days, probably a defect.  Note: I am a 60 year old walker.  I contacted Powerstep and they did not really care... just deal with wherever you purchased them.  Now I am dealing with a return (just made the 30 day window) and looking for a better product..  The pair on the left were 6 months old, on the right only 27 days.  Being diabetic, there is no way I could have walked with a rock in my shoe."
5.0,LOVE these! they have helped my foot pain within the first day of wearing them
5.0,Excellent fit !  Will buy again!
5.0,A solution to my plantar fasciitis. This is the fourth pair I have bought. I'm a hiker and I wear them out and just keep replacing them. Your mileage may vary.
5.0,I have worn these for over a year now. I purchased them on the advise of a podiatrist. I can't get along without them. The price I Amazon beat the sporting goods store by almost $30! Thanks.
4.0,"Great pair of soles! Usually when I am working my feet start to hurt around the 5 hour mark with my old soles, but today I put in these ones and I am not limping when I get home."
5.0,"I was given my first pair of Powerstep insoles by my podiatrist. They almost instantly helped my arch and heel pain. When they began to show signs of wear, I found them on Amazon for half as much as my Dr. was charging. I have them in all my shoes. They do a fantastic job of relieving foot pain and fatigue."
5.0,Great
5.0,Very good product and delivered quickly
5.0,"The product arrived quickly & in excellent (new) condition
 It fits perfectly-true to size-and works great with my shoes!"
5.0,Love these in my sneaker  was using 3/4 length but I move with these definitely will purchase again
3.0,"I bought this since I bought some from my foot doctor. They help a lot with plantar fasciitis. However, although these are powerstep, the quality is really subpar compared to the powerstep protech l had before. It's only been two months and the material on top of it is peeling. Disappointed with it."
5.0,These fit perfect!  My feet felt wonderful compared to before!
5.0,Great inserts. First got them at a running store. If you have a pronation problem-these are the answer.
5.0,Love them feel better already!
5.0,I wear them in all my shoes.
5.0,Makes standing and walking a lot smoother...
5.0,"These are the best on the market!  Even the podiatrist couldn't get the right fit for me, but all I did was order these and they fit!!!"
5.0,Fits great.
5.0,Would buy again
5.0,Great
2.0,"My feet didn't feel any better than what I started with and for the price I paid, they should have done something. Dr. Scholls are $2 more and feel much better."
5.0,"These worked wonders for me! They lasted nearly a whole year before I had to break down and buy another pair. I am on my feet 40+ hours a week and developed plantar fasciitis. These relieved my pain completely. When they started to wear down, my feet were back to aching. I could barely walk when I took my shoes off. These save my feet. I will be ordering these every time."
5.0,"This product healed me. I recommended this product to many coworkers- all from hotel industry who are walking a minimum of 17000steps/shift. Everyone swears by this product. Great arch support, it takes few hours to get used to, doesn't make your shoes feel cushy, rather feels funny at first., but arch support reliefs pain in a heal, ankles and knees and the funny feel goes away very fast as your feet adjust to it."
5.0,So far I think they will do the trick. I'm just having to convince my feet they should not pronate so much.  So I wear them for about 10 minutes of my jog then switch once my feet get used too I think they will be awesome. Fit perfectly in my shoes
5.0,Love them!
5.0,"Purchased these for my daughter as recommended by her chiropractor. No foot pain after wearing them day one! Already purchased more. Works like a charm, beats buying expensive custom supports, which she quickly outgrew."
5.0,great product great price you'll pay triple retail at a running store great for heal spurs.
5.0,"My husband works on his feet 10-12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. He was having a lot of pain. I came to Amazon and found these. After looking at reviews and the fact that these are very reasonably priced, we decided to go with these.

My husband has been wearing them for months now and he has so much relief now. They started helping him right away. He is so happy to have found relief. When at home, he wears compression socks and wears them to sleep as well. This combination has made the pain reduce to a very minimal amount. But these inserts are really what did it for him."
5.0,I exchanged the soles in my running shoes. Very nice........
5.0,These inserts fit well and feel good. I'm able to walk longer distances with less pain during and after the walks. My only warning is to those with flat feet. You need a well-pronounced arch for these to fit properly.
5.0,Good support. I wear those in my office shoes every day.
5.0,Powerstep Pinacles are slightly thicker than the standard Powerstep due to their added cushioning but not so much to be an issue.  They provide the same excellent arch support as the standard.
5.0,"they work good,"
5.0,"For me these insoles are the best!
I am in my 60's, I have flat feet, and for years have tried many insoles including one prescribed by a foot doctor without satisfaction.
These were so comfortable that I even forget that I've been wearing them all day long."
1.0,"No size specified...why did I order these? Returned.
<sigh>"
4.0,Have been wearing these for years but usually get them in pediatrist's office. I put them in  all my enclosed shoes.  They are a foot saver. I really can't say anything bad about these.
5.0,It really help with my Plantar Fasciitis . I walk all day at work. Great product.
5.0,"These are awesome and will really help with foot pain but as a waiter I walk so much that I need to replace at around 3 months, I don't think people in other occupations will need to buy so quickly.  I recommend this item"
4.0,"I wear a D width shoe, but can easily buy mainstream shoes by New Balance, Easy Spirit, Aerosoles in a D width. I thought these would be the perfect thing to help add support to my work shoes (flats, low heeled shoes). These orthotics are made for legit orthotic shoes that you have to order specially made. The orthotics were so thick that I couldn't fit my shoes on my foot. I will be returning and trying the Powerstep SlimFit 3/4 length."
5.0,Excellent cushion and support for periodic flareups of Plantar Fasc.
1.0,It takes way to long to get this order
4.0,I have had the old insoles for about 5 years and they are starting to break down on support.  How often should I replace them?
5.0,"This is the first insert that has fit my arch. Next time I will get the one that has the most padding though, I have very tender feet."
1.0,To small
5.0,These are the best orthotics I've tried and I've tried quite a few. They have great arch support and heel cushioning. Good for plantar fasciitis.
5.0,Very good support and fit is excellent.
5.0,love this inserts for my walking
4.0,It supportive... I still ache but they are supportive and firm.
4.0,"decent arch support.  I wish there was more padding under the toes, but that might just be my requirement.  I use for running and agility training."
4.0,I used to buy these at the podiatrist office...this is cheaper and easier!
3.0,"If you are thinking of purchasing these insoles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerstep-Pinnacle-Orthotics-U-Blue-Blue-Men-s-10-10-5-Women-s-12-12-5/dp/B000KPKMX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics-U, Blue/Blue, Men's 10 - 10.5 / Women's 12 - 12.5</a>&nbsp;I'd strongly recommend you're buying a half size bigger than your shoe size. You can always trim them down to fit but what I discovered was that they were somewhat short and therefore did not comfortably fit for my feet. The arch support and cushioned sole, however, are very good."
5.0,"Have used these for years for my wife and my shoes. The right amount of support, cushioning and flex for great comfort. The MAX version is a bit stiffer and has a slight outward tilt in the heel to help pronation, if you need it."
5.0,Very nice. Lot better than Dr Scholls. They fit in my moccasins well. My only suggestion is to buy two sizes because I was able to use a 7 and 8 in different shoes. Both worked well and I will buy more in the future.
5.0,Good fit and helps with arch support.
5.0,"I'd previously used Powerstep Orthotics that I received at my Podiatrist's office and wondered if these would be as good. Trust me, you won't know the difference. Very comfortable, and provide the support for people with foot issues such as myself. I use custom orthotics while I'm at work, but for work around the house and golf these provide plenty of support."
5.0,Very comfortable and improve walking distance.
3.0,Ok
5.0,Just what the foot DR. ordered.
4.0,good orthotics
4.0,"This is a clear example that going for better products is a wise choice. I bought these insoles along with a pair of cheaper ones and definitely love these ones. My plantar fasciitis issues have decreased and I feel heel support as well. From now on, this will be my brand to get."
4.0,"They are better than most insoles, but my feet still hurt at work after 5 or 6 hours straight."
5.0,I love these  insoles . Help a lot walking on  concrete all day .
5.0,good fit
5.0,"I was having bad foot pain and it was probably plantar fasciitis and this helped save my feet. No pain anymore and they are so comfortable to wear. I am not saying they are miracle insoles but they helped me tremendously. Also, I have been using them for a few months and they have held up well."
5.0,thank you
5.0,Best product ever!  I have had Plantars Fascitis  and these are helping a lot.
4.0,"Same product I paid double for at a custom shoe store.  They give awesome high arch support in normal shoes, boots and tennis shoes.  Helps my back a lot to wear them.  I recommend these for high arch people."
5.0,Perfect
4.0,fit well and arrived on time
4.0,"I am having problems with heel pain.  It appears there is one product level higher with more cushioning in them.  If I were to reorder, I would order the ones with more cushioning."
5.0,good
5.0,Have been buying this exact insole for years. Can't beat it.
5.0,"Everything I ever wanted in a generic insole. I put these in my hiking boots and they instantly turned a reasonably comfortable pair of new boots into something I could trek in all day comfortably. With generic insoles, I have found it hard to find just the right amount of arch support for my relatively high arches. Even though I need a good amount of support, too much can cause even worse pain. These are perfect and provide just enough cushioning without taking up so much space that the boot becomes unwearable.

-----

UPDATE NOV 2106

Because my health insurance covered custom orthotics I had some made. Suffice to say, I much prefer these Powerstep insoles to the ones custom made for my feet. Will be buying several pairs."
5.0,"These are the best insoles for plantar fasciitis!  I have had them for over 4. years and are beginning to replace
Great product"
5.0,A+++++
2.0,These are just too thick to fit inside any of my shoes without creating the kind of friction that causes bunions. I can't really use these.
5.0,Great arch support
5.0,"I'm on my feet all day, on rocky paths, up and down, and these feel great for the whole time. Highly recommended."
5.0,Work great for relieving foot pain.
5.0,My husband and I have foot issues and must wear orthotics. We have had the expensive ones from the podiatrist and these work just as well. We walked all over Europe with them and our feet fared very well. Comfortable.
5.0,Fit great with so much cushion.
4.0,"I think the perameters of the insole was 12-13.5, and my size is 13"
5.0,"I have had very expensive custom made orthotics before.  While I would not say these are as good as my best custom made orthotic, they are VERY close!  And how cool is that for being a fraction of the cost?  Great inserts.  Don't mull over this decision - just get them."
1.0,"Terribly disapponired...they seem to have been
thrown in the mailing bag, box was not sealed
and they are less cushioned than the Dr. Scholls
brand one that I already have! Need to return but
no paperwork was enclosed!"
5.0,"I have never used insert before so I didn't know what to expect.  I love them.  I wear them at work all day and for 2 more hours at the gym.  My feet do not hurt.  They do make your shoes feel a little tight, I had to loosen my shoe strings to allow some room so the top of my foot wasn't so squished.  I will re-order these in the future."
5.0,Great feel and provides excellant cushion for my hill.
5.0,"Does exactly what i needed it to do inside my regular but far too flat shoes! Awesome, will be ordering more!"
5.0,These shoe inserts fit perfectly and they are comfortable to wear and are very supportive for my feet. They help provide the support I needed to help with my daily foot pain.
1.0,This is the worst insult I have ever purchased it's like walking on concrete waste of money definitely going to ask for a refund after two days of trying it out my feet are killing me
5.0,Thanks
5.0,the item is good arch support. it's my shoes don't have the arch support. i like this item.
5.0,"They are arch supports - I can't answer questions about shoes!
They are fine, very comfortable with Nikes."
5.0,Great insoles at a good price !
5.0,"The podiatrist recommended this specific product for my husband. They last for a year or 2 so I have bought these before. Amazon has the best price out there & believe me, I search and compare thoroughly before I buy. I have been an Amazon customer since 1999 so I can say with confidence: thank you Amazon!"
1.0,Arch support goes flat once you put your weight on it
5.0,Price and comfort
5.0,I have had many pairs of the arch supports and will have many more. They replaced the high priced ones from the doctor.
5.0,My podiatrist recommended these for my walking shoes.  They are very comfortable and provide great arch support.
5.0,excellent transaction - highly recommend this product
5.0,Love these!
5.0,Excellent for work boots when you are standing all day.
5.0,"Foot quit hurting immediately!
Amazing."
5.0,I do a lot of walking for recreation and these help a lot.  I also wear boots all day at work and they great for that also.
5.0,Has really helped with my plantar fasciitis
4.0,"THEY WERE PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR FOR LIGAMENT STRESS...SO FAR, SO GOOD!"
5.0,I have had to buy orthotics for years. These are by far the absolute best. They give me much needed arch support yet have mega cushion in them. Price is great at Amason.
5.0,It was recommended I buy orthotics from podiatrist and I ordered these in a womens 8-1/2 - they fit in my shoes but work best with wide or roomy shoes. Not so well with pointed toe shoes. I adjusted to them very well and my feet feel so much better! So much cheaper than custom made by Dr and much better than lower quality and priced orthotics.
5.0,These orthotics are really comfortable and add some good arch support throughout the day.
4.0,I had heel spurs pretty badly and this was a great relief on my feet.  I especially love using them in my Zumba shoes.  I am a Zumba Instructor and teaching so often can be hard on your feet and these offered extra support.  The only thing is that they wear out quickly.  The upper layer starts to separate from the bottom layer and they become unusable.  This happens too quickly and they are expensive.
3.0,"after feeling a YOW pain repeatedly in my foot, which sent me to the doctor I saw that my options included granny shoes or inserts.  I am NOT giving up my collection of ankle boots.  So inserts it is!  I've now tried very expensive customs inserts, these powerstep jobbies and $10cvs brand inserts.
My favorites are the cvs arch supports .  the $35 power steps may last longer, but they don't work any better.
go figure.
I'm on my feel a LOT and walk a LOT"
5.0,Helps keep my Plantar Faciatis at bay.
5.0,I put these in all my shoes. A bit pricey but very worth it for the extra arch comfort they provide. Check the different color power step inserts for different levels of support depending on your feet. For me the Blue are perfect!
5.0,"great product, keep several pairs for all shoes!!!"
5.0,"Love these for my ""Adult Acquired Flat Foot"". My DPM friend gave me my first couple when he first diagnosed me. I run, hike, golf, walk and work in these. I use them in most of my shoes and boots."
5.0,Works great!!
5.0,"I have been experiencing severe heel pain.  The evenings and mornings are excrutiating.  I believe that I need custom orthotics.  I decided to try this product first and, much to my surprise, I feel very little foot pain after the first day of use.  Durability is unknown but I will post an update if I become dissatisfied.  For now, this product deserves a 5 star rating as I haven't had this much pain relief in a very long time."
5.0,Fit and feel great. Did take out the liners in my shoes as recommended.
5.0,Use these all the time.
5.0,"Beat inserts I've ever had,  don't you waste your money on superfeet, Way too expensive and so stick with the pinnacle inserts, good for sore feet for high arches"
5.0,"Excellent fit, and they provide wonderful comfort and support!"
5.0,I love them. I am 43 and am on my feet all day. I was having some pretty serious heel pain and one of my coworkers suggested these. I figured I'd give it a shot before making a trip to the doctor and he was right. After a couple days my heel pain faded and my feet feel much better after 10 hours on them.
4.0,"Nice cushioning, moderate arch support. Fits well in my size 10 women's shoes."
4.0,"I use these as insoles for my boots.  I can wear them all day, but sometimes i want to stand at my desk, in which case, i can probably do an hour before i get slightly sore.  A good combination might be these for arch support, and then a gel insole for comfort"
5.0,Great insoles!
2.0,"I tried, did not work for me.  After trying these in several different shoes."
4.0,Great insoles with excellent arch support that I use in multiple shoes for multiple activities. They lasted me a little under a year before I had to replace them but I work on my feet and am moving around a lot so they might last others longer. You might have to trim them a little depending on the shoe you're wearing them with but that's easy to do with a good pair of scissors.
4.0,HELPS A LOT  VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
3.0,Acceptable quality. No issues
5.0,I love these . The are the only inserts that work for me!!!
5.0,"Wore them all day walking at Disneyland from 10am to 10pm, really saved my feet!"
3.0,"As an orthotic, I think the quality is fair. They offer more support and are more comfortable than other low-cost orthotics I've tried. But they are too large for most of my shoes and make me feel as if my heels are slipping out of my shoes as I walk.  They also did not offer enough heel cushion for me."
5.0,My Podiatrist recommended these several years ago and I have worn them ever since. I had planters facetious and was in a lot of discomfort. The doctor recommended that I use these inserts and change my work shoes every 3 months. He said no matter how much you pay for shoes the support breaks down after 3 months. Best advice I've ever received. I change my shoes every 3 months (only pay about $35 a pair now instead of $100 a pair ) and I use these inserts and change them every 6 months. My Podiatrist charges $35 a pair for these inserts so this is a great price at amazon at $22.50.
4.0,I've had these before.  Bought them from a sporting shoe store.  Paid more.  This was good buy.
4.0,Product is decent. I prefer the brand Aetrex but they cost twice as much so these are a good value.
3.0,This version of Powerstep is great for the arch but the heel portion is not cupped enough and a firmer orthodic bed is what I should have purchased. Every foot is different.
4.0,"I marked an all day wear but I only wear them 8 to 10 hours at work 5 to 6 days a week in my work boots. I work in a metal shop so I wear steel toe shoes & boots & walk upwards of 5 miles a day there. The bottoms of my feet are more comfortable than they ever have been in my boots, however this put my feet up higher (I wear 2 different types of shoes) which now cause's the heel of my foot to sit up higher making the heel rub against an un-padded section of my boot. so I've ordered a padded heel insert to correct the problem with my boots. Since I'm a supervisor I have a set on nice black shoes to wear for business functions, audits & what not & I work as I said in a Metal Shop so my shoes are steel toed these inserts push my feet up to high to where I can't wear the shoes at all.
These inserts are well made & have a look that they will last a long time the issue with insert raising my feet up are in no way the inserts fault I wouldn't need them in the shoes were made better, so I don't know what you want to take from that."
5.0,Great product.
5.0,I am using these inserts with a sneaker that already has some arch support but I felt that I needed more.  Got these based on another reviewers recommendation.  Thus far I am satisfied with these inserts.  I have however not tried any other insoles for similar purposes so can not compare withother brands.  Although I am happy with this one.
5.0,"really helped- i only wear them in my shoes now.  i have two pair.  on one pair, i had to trim the top slightly to fit in a shoe, but generally, they fit well.  also, for some of my shoes, i had to take out their soles, otherwise it was too tight.  which in some case involved tearing them out- but not to worry- these insoles do a fantastic job of replacing them.  i wear them regularly and have held their form for now 3 years.  however, after the first year, some of the cushion has gone away.

it takes a little getting used to at first.  it's a different feel, and there is a bit of sliding, so for active sports, you may notice more of a difference, and they may not be best for that.  but for everyday use, it just takes a day or two to get used to them.  also, in those first 2 days, i would only wear them for about half the day, because the arch of your foot my get a little sore being at a new angle."
5.0,Perfect stabilization for my planter facetious.
5.0,Excellent??
5.0,"I'm a long-time fan of this insole.  Pinnacle model is a bit softer.  Good, solid arch support.  And they last as long as the shoes."
4.0,makes my 6 mile walks more comfortable
2.0,Bought two pairs to save on shipping.  First pair fell apart after one week.  Second pair holding up so far.  Heel seems to breakdown quick.
4.0,"These orthotics work well.  In fact, I now have 4 sets.  So, yes, I would recommend them."
5.0,These are great. I have Plantar Fasciitis and nerve damage at the bottom of my feet. I've tried quite a few different inserts and these seem to work well. I wore them on vacation at least 7 hours each day. I will buy more for my other shoes.
4.0,love it
5.0,This is the third pair I have purchased and they support my foot beautifully.  I have high arches and I need the protection these orthotics provide!
5.0,Good product
5.0,Felt the difference these made after 3 days
5.0,"2 second review:
These are great inserts that are comfortable and provide great arch support. Get them!

In Depth review:
I suffer from some foot problems. Suffer is a strong word but pretty accurate. Details are here, or just jump to the next paragraph because you probably don't actually care about my feet.
I have flat feet with barely any arch in them. I also have bunions which make my toes angle about 15 degrees inward (and judging by my father they will be at 45 degrees in the next 15 years). My flat feet creates adduction (rotating inward) in my step, worsening the bunion issue and increasing the tension in my feet. In any case, all these things make my feet hurt frequently. Not necessarily every day, and not necessarily ""pain"" where it is sharp an unbearable. Think what sore muscles feel like, as a deep inside dull pain - sometimes throbbing - and just constantly there. That is as close as I can describe it. So anyways - that is my situation.
I have always looked at arch supports and cushioning to attempt to help with my situation. I have never been happy with any of the products or results. So I basically stopped looking figuring nothing off the shelf would ever help. My mom went to a podiatrist for some of her issues and she got inserts that cost $400 and even then she wasn't happy with them. I pretty much just gave up and accepted my lot in life.

An extended family member mentioned she wore these and loved them, just in a passing comment, so I looked them up and decided to give them a try. Honestly, I bought a pair for my wife first since she works on her feet. When they arrived I looked at them and stood on them (without shoes) just to get an idea on what they are like. They seemed good, and my wife confirmed she liked them so I pulled the trigger and bought myself a pair.

I have worn these for about a week now and love them. Are they the best thing out there? Probably not. Are they the solution for everybody? Probably not. But I do think they are probably the best over the counter item that you can buy and will probably help 90% of the people out there. All for a reasonable price.

Support -
These supports add a good amount of support, and hold my feet in a position that doesn't allow them to move in a way that will hurt my feet or ankles. They are very comfortable, and my lower back pain is lessened from the improved step.
I would probably comment that I do feel them pressing on my arches, since I am flat footed. This can be uncomfortable after a while, but not worse than the typical foot pain I have without them, so the benefits far outweigh this issue. I would suspect if my arches were slightly higher (or the supports slightly lower) I wouldn't feel this at all.

Sizing -
I bought the Men's 10-10.5 sizing. I wear 10 or 10.5 depending on the cut of the shoe.
Ironically, I just bought a paid of 11s just because the cut tapered in at the tip (which isn't good for my bunions) but in the 11 it fit well around my toes and the extra space in front doesn't alter my standing or stepping.
The Pinnacles fit the size 11 shoes exactly.comparing the removed insoles to the Pinnacle they were a dead on match in size.
That surprised me since I wouldn't have imagined that much extra material would be used, but at the end of the day it is a good thing, because they are pretty much guaranteed to fit your shoes - but also very likely you will need to trim them to fit.
I will also comment that with the full length insert they recommend you remove the shoes existing insert first. This is a must as otherwise the shoe is too tight and cramped and just trades one problem for another. But actually replacing the insole is like converting your shoe into something new and better.

I don't switch between shoes very often, but I can definitely see me buying a couple pairs of these and cutting them to fit ever shoe I own.
It is well worth the investment."
5.0,The only brand that helps with my plantar fasciitis.  Worth the $.
4.0,Pleased with product
5.0,these are for my husband. They really work great for his arches. The price was great and fast delivery.
3.0,"These offer arch support and nice cushioning but are not right for me. They are a bit too thick for my Ghost 8's.

The main problem is that the arch is too high and very uncomfortable for me. Same thing with Powerstep original. I believe I have low arches and only need a little support.

Superfeet blue and black were also too high, and too hard feeling.

If Powerstep made a ""low arch"" version that was only HALF the arch height of the original or Pinnacle that might work. I need to return them."
4.0,"While these inserts are good, but they lack some of the support I need.  I'm flat footed and have a wide foot.
I've worn these for a full work week; 5 days. I'm a 66 years-old, male who substitutes in public schools and I walk about 6 hours a day on concrete floors.
I've put them in my Justin work boots and walking shoes. I have a 4-E width and though these inserts don't cover my whole foot, they do the job. I sure wish they were more sturdy.
My feet are tired at the end of the day, but they don't hurt. This is an improvement from the ones I from Sofsole. The Sofsole inserts provided the support and my feet didn't hurt. But I can't find them at Amazon anymore."
5.0,Very pleased. Surprisingly comfortable and good value.  Good support and cushioning.
5.0,I suffer from planter fasciitis and these have been the only thing that has helped to reduce the pain.
5.0,These are great and cheaper than shoe store
5.0,very happy with these.
5.0,"I started working at a bar and quickly learned after one shift that i needed something for my boots. My heels felt like they were on fire all night.

I found these and immediately slipped them into my shoes and walked around. It did make the boot more snug but fortunately i had enough room and it helped my heel from rubbing. Although these aren't going to make up for an 8 hr shift on your feet and make them feel pedicure-fresh, they helped immensely. I feel less fatigue and it gives me the support in my high arch that i needed. The only critique i can give is that i would like the toe area could be a little more gel textured if possible.

Still, i am happy with my purchase. I paid FULL price and my review is truly unbiased. I'm just thankful these exist and that i found them on my first try in the quest for great insoles!"
5.0,Happy with my purchase
5.0,very good insoles for my Peripheral neuropathy
5.0,These are really helping my feet! I have had plantar Fasciitis and have had no relief from the hard plastic type orthotics.
3.0,"I was hoping these insoles would help with my plantar fasciitis and lessen my foot pains.  However, I developed hip pains the first day wearing these and walking for about an hour.  My hip pains went away a couple of days after I stopped using these.  I am afraid to wear these again."
5.0,"Solves my plantar fasciitis problem.  Tried others, they don't work.  I just wish the heel material wouldn't wear out, I wouldn't have to replace them as often."
5.0,Read a lot of positive reviews.  I like them and will buy again.
5.0,A+
5.0,A shoe salesman recommended these for my condition. They work better than the custom orthodics I had made for $300. Completely satisfied!
5.0,They are great! I love them!
5.0,I absolutely LOVE these shoe inserts!  I have planter fascia and tarsal tunnel and cant go without my shoes.  These inserts provide outstanding support for my feet.  I have purchased these 6 different times and will purchase more!  I like them in all my shoes and they last for about 3-4 months for me.  However I do a lot of walking and working.
5.0,Provided what I needed.
3.0,"Not as supportave as the Maxx, and yet still thicker than the competing superfeet offerings.  I ended up returning them."
5.0,Been wearing them for years. Top notch insert.
5.0,These have become my husbands favorite orthotics.  He stands all day on a cement floor and these help him tremendously.  He can always tell when it's time for them to be replaced because his back starts hurting.  He puts in a new pair and the back pain goes away. Because of how much they help him we always keep a spare pair in the closet.
5.0,"Very comfortable, recommended by my Doctor."
5.0,I couldn't walk in my sneakers without these. They work extremely well and I have a pair in every pair of sneakers. I bit too big for dress shoes though.
5.0,great
5.0,As described.  Great service
5.0,I love these and wear them always. This is a great price.
5.0,Very comfortable
4.0,Met expectations
5.0,"i bought this for my sister - good product, recommended by her podiatrist."
5.0,"I had sever metatarsal pain, but with my power step insoles, I have noticed a significant improvement, and notable pain decrease. Love them!"
4.0,Excellent for plantar problems. I've used these for many years and they are comfortable wearing all day.
5.0,"These are every bit as good, if not better, than the Archcrafters 'custom' shoe inserts I've gotten a few times after using their foot measuring foam thing. I require a good amount of arch support, and these deliver them in spades. As someone who wears those Archcrafters, and then Birkenstocks around the house due to their great arch support and stable heel cup, I didn't find these stiff or cumbersome. I found them soft but supportive. And the 11-11.5 size I got fit right into multiple 11 size shoes. 3 of these is the price of one Archcrafters. No brainer."
5.0,My doctor gave me these insoles for my foot that suffers from arthritis.  I have used them for 6 months and just love them.  I needed more insoles because I didn't want to keep changing them out with all my shoes.  I ended up buying two more.
5.0,Gives support and cushion
5.0,Pinnacle is wonderful - couldn't imagine my gym/walking shoes without them.
5.0,"Superior arch support that was well worth the money.
My orthopedist recommended this product after I injured my arch using a cheaper support.
It supported my injury during healing, and I continue to use it.

I should think it would be all purpose for guys.
I just move them to whatever lady's non-dress shoe I'm wearing that day.  I buy a new set when the current set starts to look worn.
(It's very difficult to find a product that's both subtle and functional for lady's dress shoes.)

They're about the same thickness as a standard sneaker insert - so they swap well with exercise or hiking shoes.
Wear/take the inserts (and socks of appropriate thickness) with you when buying dress shoes or other shoes that don't come with removable inserts, as they will take up additional space.
Fabulous product."
1.0,"Any shoe I put these in they roll my ankle too far to the outside, that they are unwearable."
5.0,Best arch support insoles I have found.
5.0,Love the power step insert have these in another pair of shoes just what the dr. Ordered my  feet loves them
5.0,I've bought this product before and liked it. Amazon offered it cheaper
5.0,Best product out there
5.0,"Pinnacle seems to have more cushioning so my husband likes them better. He's tried all the other Powerstep inserts as well as other brands. This is his must have insert. He is 6'3"" and weighs 257lbs with bone spurs (plantar fasciitis) and a high instep. He is very active and wears these in all his shoes. His bone spurs rarely bother him any more. Remember to replace them every 3 months if you wear them every day, especially if you weigh more than average and/or run."
5.0,The minute I buy my running shoes I rip out the insole that comes with the shoe and replace them with this insole.  They bring many more miles to my running shoe.  I ran a half marathon without them and ended up with plantar fascitis.  From that point on I have never run without these insoles.  They fit as expected and feel wonderful.  I have worn mine for years.
5.0,"Been using doctor scholls for years with no real relief from my heel spur. Theses suckers however not only helped my heel but my ankle pain and all other foot pains I was having. Going to buy these for every shoe/boot I have.
Took about 2 days to get used to now I won't live without them."
5.0,They fit great and feel great as well
1.0,"Does not really offer support seems to make feet hurt even more they are not bendable, very stiff. Didn't work for me"
5.0,Best inserts I have found.
5.0,These inserts are terrific. They have immediately relieved a huge percentage of my foot pain. Better than I could have imagined! Highly recommend them.
4.0,Seems to be helping my ankle (Achilles Tendonitus).
5.0,Have used for some time successfully.  Time for a new pair.
5.0,I have plantar fasciitis and these are an absolute must!  I have these in several of my shoes now so I don't have to trade them out.  I can wear my tennis shoes all day long with these inserts.  I will definitely continue to buy these as they wear out and continue using them in my shoes.  They are amazing!  I purchased the expensive custom made inserts from a podiatrist and I actually like these better.  These are much cheaper and make my feet feel better than any other insert.
5.0,These things are great!.  Feel more comfortable than what I was using I think bc of a little extra cushioning. I've been wearing arch supports for a few years bc they really help with discomfort for my condition.
5.0,"I have tried a few orthotics ..never custom made but I've been through about every brand available in stores.  I like the powerstep pinnacle because it supportive without feeling like I'm walking on a board ... I have very high arches and when they aren't supported I suffer big time. I could probably use a little more arch support and may consider trying the pinnacle max.  I love these insoles, they do the job while still providing cushion and they do not cause my feet to sweat like some others and I've been wearing these for a few weeks with no smell ... my previous pair lasted a good 7 or 8 months of everyday wear."
5.0,Great support and comfort at a moderate price.
5.0,Comfy in my running shoes.
5.0,Great
5.0,Love these orthotics.  I've worn them before and knew exactly what I wanted to get again. Price on amazon.com is much better than in stores in town.
5.0,Have had in past . So far so good
5.0,"There is no comparison for these life savers.  I have been wearing these Powerstep Pinnacle inserts for 10 years. I wear them a few months, buy a new pair, take the pair from my work boots and rotate them over to my other shoes. I have a stack of factory inserts from all my other shoes.  I keep a pair of the Power Pinnacle is every shoe I have by this rotating method. Sure they wear out, but I try to catch them before.  Those of you that still suffer pain, I recommend getting the sock to wear at night. It has a strap to slightly stretch your foot just past 90 back towards your knee.  This stretches the muscle that causes most of your pain. Wear it once in a while and no more morning pain when you get out of bed.  Then slip into your Powerstep Pinnacle lined shoe and you are good to go for the day! Hope this helps!!!"
5.0,Have used this product before they do the job for my surgically repaired feet.
5.0,"Best orthotics hands down.  Have used probably a dozen other brands over the years, spent thousands on podiatrist visits and special shoes, and these help my poor aching feet better than anything else.  I am a nurse and on my feet for many many hours a day."
5.0,I like this product
3.0,"Not enough room between shoe bottom and laces, press down on the top of my foot. Width and length just fine"
5.0,These inserts are the best and last forever!!! Relieve my arch and plantar pain; never go without them in my walking/exercise shoes
5.0,I have issues with one of my feet due to an accident. My Powerstep Pinnacles take most of the pain away.
5.0,Great support
5.0,Have worn these for 5 years. I am positive there are other very good insoles but for the money these are great.
5.0,Changed my running for the better. Fantastic arch support.
5.0,"Worked great for my 12 hour shifts at the hospital. Now I may not need to go back to the foot doctor for injections in my heel. Awesome product, with perfect arch support that is firm and does not bend  or flatten out when you walk on them. Not much cushion for the ball of the foot, but excellent arch support.  Trish in Ocala, Fl."
5.0,Great orthotics.
5.0,Very comfortable
5.0,Awesome!!
5.0,"I have several sets of these orthotics and have worn them for years. They are durable, comfortable, and have solved my problems with heel spurs and aching feet."
5.0,"This is my third pair. I love them. They last, comfortable & fit just perfect."
5.0,"Reliable, durable, and increases the comfort of my sneakers."
5.0,Fit great and last a long time. I have had custom inserts and these are just as good at a fraction of the cost.
5.0,"After my other insoles wore out, I foolishly went without any for a number of months.  Only after my feet started severely hurting did I start looking for replacements.  These are insoles are awesome.  As someone who's on his feet for 8+ hours a day, these insoles have me coming home without any sore feet (even after an extremely long day).  I would recommend Powerstep products to everybody that is experiencing  foot pain."
5.0,"I use these inserts in all of my shoes and have been for years.  Makes any shoe much more comfortable and helps eliminate or minimize foot, knee and lower back pain."
5.0,Best orthotic inserts in the market.
5.0,Does the job and good quality.
5.0,great for foot support on  most types of shoes. not too soft so its built more for support than  just comfort.
4.0,These were originally recommended by a foot doctor because of my plantar facadiasce. I've used them continuously for many years with good results.
5.0,"I read many of the reviews of this insole before buying. My brother swears by them, so, with plantar fasciitis, I gave them a try. Now, a week or so later, I have no pain from PF while wearing these insoles. When I awake in the morning, the pain is still there until I put on my shoes with the PowerSteps. Seems like a remarkable ""cure"" that's very much welcome."
5.0,Super comfortable. Very happy with the arch support. I am going to buy more for other shoes. Very good support and stability
5.0,Fit great !
5.0,"I had a new pair of boots that were just a bit too large. I put these in and now the boots fit perfectly, and the insole is extremely comfortable. The sizing was also very good."
4.0,"work as designed. It takes a few days to get used to it.  Once you are used to it then it feel nice.  But my heel still hurts at times, not as much before like with the default insoles that came along with the shoes. I use it with my running shoes but I do mostly walking with them."
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he can definitely notice a difference!
2.0,"Bought these for my tendinitis. Wore them for a few months during cycling and walking to/from the car while letting my foot heal. After two months, took them with me on a trip to DC and my tendinitis flared up pretty badly after just one day of walking around. Also, don't expect to wear them with Toms or Converse. They won't fit."
5.0,Excellent product
5.0,"Without these I would be in pain all day long. I've worn these for probably close to 10 years. Cute/trendy ""fashion"" shoes with no support become wearable all day long with these inserts put in.

I have to replace them every 2-3 years but that's OK with me, I honestly don't know where I'd be without them!"
5.0,"I've had issues with plantar fasciitis and heel pain, and had gone to a podiatrist for alcohol injections to dull the nerves.  The doctor visits did nothing but hit me for a bunch of money, so I got these in desperation.  Initially they didn't seem to do much but they felt better than the stock insoles.  Then after a few weeks, the pain gradually went away.  In my case, it helped cure an ailment I've been dealing with for months, so I put these in every pair of shoes I could.  Obviously your experience will probably vary and this shouldn't be a substitute for a doctor consultation.

If for no other reason, these make standing and walking for longer periods of time much more tolerable.  Keep in mind that if your shoe is already tight, these are thick and will make them feel even tighter.  If you have the option to, use a slightly larger shoe or loosen the laces a bit to allow for the extra cushioning space."
2.0,These inserts didn't do it for me.  The arch support is too light. They help a bit but not much.
5.0,"Have worn almost daily for the past year.  First pair about finished, am now ordering two more pair.  Relieved my foot pain.  No further issues.  Very good product."
4.0,Feels good.  Hope it will eventually relieve the pain of the plantar fasciitis.
4.0,I bought these for my husband.  He is only 35 and works on his feet all day-really long days.  One day he started to complain how bad his feet hurt.  We made an appointment for a foot doctor but before we went to the appointment I bought him these to just try.  While he did say they helped-they didn't resolve the issue.  HOWEVER he does feel that these were just as good as the $545.00 custom pair from the foot doctor.  Worth a shot.
5.0,"Powerstep Pinnacle Premium Orthotic Shoe Insoles, Flexible Cushioning, Perfect For Alleviating Foot Pain
I have flat feet and over pronate, much more on the right than the left.  As I've aged, the usual problems developed; painful great toe joint (right foot), pinky toe corn (right foot), easily twisted, weak ankles, etc. I gave up high heels when I was 40 years old which helped a bit (now 65).  About ten years ago, a podiatrist made me custom orthotics ($600!!).  I tried wearing them for a couple of months but didn't find them at all comfortable.  I've been stumbling along until very recently,  when I decided to try non-prescription inserts. Amazon offered free returns so figured I had nothing to lose.  These Powerstep inserts have been amazing.  I wear them in my Clark Wave Trek shoes, size 8.5 wide.  It took me a few days to get used to them; they didn't hurt or bother me, but I was aware of them.  Now, they feel perfectly natural.  I can't wait to try them out on our 14 day trip through Israel and Jordan next month- lots and lots of walking."
5.0,excellent transactionw
1.0,"I've work these insoles for over 10 years. In the last year, I've noticed I have to replace them more often. The final straw was that I bought a pair in the middle of June, and they had a hole in them by the end of July--I got one month out of them. This is absurd. I'm looking for another brand now."
5.0,They are very good.
5.0,"This is my second pair of these orthotics that I own.  The first pair I bought at a local company here in Boston (and paid considerably more), and these were recommended to my by my podiatrist.

My medical problem is most likely not the same as yours.  I'm missing some cartilage in an ankle, which, due to the pain, was causing me to alter the way I walk which in turn was causing pain in a different part of my foot.  When my doctor told me I needed to start wearing orthotics to help get me walking normally I was a little skeptical that they could actually help.  But...  here I am, getting my second pair.

These are comfortable and fit a 10.5 Men's shoe perfectly.  I can't recommend these enough."
5.0,"I routinely purchase these shoe inserts as they wear out.  My feet do not hurt, but after a long day of walking around and stuff they feel wore out.  Since using these my feet have never felt wore out.  When I first started wearing them my felt like they were now on pillows.  Whatever these inserts have done corrected something in how I walk.  I don't plan to stop using them anytime soon."
4.0,"I am happy with the performance, but I wish they would hold up a little longer."
5.0,"After losing a lot of weight and exercising more, I injured my ankle and learned it's because my ankles are unstable.  Dr suggested podiatrist & custom orthotics.  My budget suggested I research first.  After reading a gazillion reviews on different shoe inserts and orthotics, I decided to invest $35 and try these.  Other reviews indicated results in one day.  I did not expect that to hold true for me...I was willing to give it a couple of weeks.  After wearing these at work for ONE DAY, my ankles and feet felt at least 75% better!  After 2 days, I noticed that my knees also felt better.  And I'm walking again, and I'm not sore the next day.  It's amazing...my legs feel less tight and sore, and low back stress is gone.  I'm getting a couple more of these immediately!
UPDATED: Last week, my massage therapist said she could see ""a big improvement"" in my alignment and muscles being less stressed--she was very surprised that this was after only a little over 2 weeks of daily wearing these orthotics.  THANK YOU, POWERSTEP!!"
5.0,I have planters fascitis and these help a lot.i have fitted orthotics at $400 a pair and these I put in my gym shoes and are a close 2nd. This way I don't have to take them out
5.0,Very good product
5.0,"These only work good with a wider shoe. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product in a Chuck Taylor, Puma suede, or Adidas shell toe. Maybe in a work boot or basketball shoe."
5.0,Helped my plantar fascitis as soon as i put them in my shoes. I really like these. I'm always on the hunt for them cheap to put in my other shoes.
4.0,"After searching for the perfect Dr Scholl's inserts for more running shoes (when the original inside wore through), I decided to settle on a  pair designated for work shoes. I then read reviews on multiple sites and realized they were probably not even worth the $7 I was about to pay for them with a coupon. I found information about most recommended ""over the counter"" inserts for shoes and determined Powerstep was one of the most recommended and used. Since I needed to replace the actual shoe insert, I needed a full length quality insole and decided to try the Original Powerstep; however, after reading reviews on Amazon and talked to someone directly with Powerstep, I chose to try the more supportive and cushioned Pinnacle for about the same price as the Original. I am very pleased with my choice. Since my shoes are quite stretched out, these fit with plenty of room to move my toes around. I removed my old, torn up insert and placed in the size 9-9.5 insoles in my size 9 shoe. It fit perfectly, without any need to trim/cut, and even had more room. I switched to a more cushioned sock and it is great with plenty of room still, but not so much that my shoe feels like it would slip off. Make sure to get the size appropriate for the shoe, not your foot size. I usually wear size 8.5 in shoes, except for athletic shoes I wear a size 9 and was concerned the insole would be too big and not line up with arches okay. Well my reservations were unnecessary thank goodness. The heel is cradled perfectly with this premium insole. The arch support is the best part of the whole insole and makes me smile wearing my shoes since it is so supportive of my feet. This is much better than any insole I have tried and I really hope they last a long time. What's great is also being able to easily move them from shoe to shoe. If these outlive my athletic shoes, I truly believe they will extend the life of any future pairs, wearing the bottoms down at a much slower pace. I would definitely recommend the Pinnacle Powerstep insole for lots of cushioned support, unless you need something ultra slim throughout and in that case, try the Original Powerstep for sure. My only complaint was I was hoping to get more cushion and support at the ball of my foot, which is pretty thin, but still helpful. I have considered looking for the ball of foot cushions made by Powerstep and adding it on top, but have not decided yet. Everything arrived in tact, well packed and secure. With Prime shipping, it arrived in a little over a day. The insoles are in official packaging from Powerstep like they were pulled right off a rack and include a guide to all the different types of Powerstep insoles. I may update my review in a few months, after determining how fast they are wearing down and a projected last-ability. One last note: Some people mentioned how the insoles needed to be eased into, by only wearing a couple of hours at a time. This may vary from person to person, based on your feet, foot issues you are trying to fix, the type of shoe you are placing the insoles inside of, and the type of movement (running, walking, etc) you are making while wearing these. For me personally, I needed no time to ease into the feel of the insoles and had no foot fatigued or discomfort of any time initially, or after wearing nearly every day for a week so far. I hope everyone else has as good of luck as me and to Powerstep: Please add a tiny bit more ball of foot cushion to the Pinnacle!"
5.0,Great insoles.
5.0,Great support for running shoes!
4.0,"I have arthritis in my feet and a big cyst on the top of one foot.  I work all day on concrete floors and up & down ladders.
No time to worry about foot pain. The inserts help, but by the end of the day I am more than ready to get my shoes off.
I had a pair of better inserts from the foot Dr. , but can't afford those every 6 months. So I am giving yours a try.  So far
I've been happy with them.  Next time I'd like to order a pair that's a little stiffer maybe. Otherwise it's THUMBS UP from me.
Thanks for asking."
5.0,"Completely honest review.  I have plantar fasciitis.  I am overweight with tiny feet(size 5.5 in womens).  I work retail so I have to be on my feet for hours in a day, at least 40 hours a week.  Upon developing plantar fasciitis, I found that even the slightest amount of walking, I had to take copious amounts of pain pills.  This went on for a while, until I began getting very concerned with the amount of aleve, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen I was consuming.  After days of research, I finally decided to invest in Asics Gel Kayano 19s and purchase these Powerstep Pinnacle inserts.  Day one, my feet still hurt, but not as much.  I didn't find myself coming home and walking like a 120 year old man.  These inserts have saved me.  They have saved my job, they have saved my sanity, and they have helped me reach a healthier weight because I can finally move again!  Not only do I buy them at least once a year(as I'm on my feet so often), I have purchased them for others who have told me about their foot pain so they could try them.  These people have been just as amazed as I was, something so small can make such a huge difference in one's quality of life.  I will never go without these inserts!"
5.0,Great product
5.0,"Finally, an insert that relieves pain caused by plantar fasciitis.  Far and away the best insert I have found.  The price is definitely worth the comfort."
5.0,"Super fast shipment, perfect fit! Thank you"
5.0,Helps with my foot problems and makes walking more comfortable.
5.0,top top product
5.0,Great! My foot doctor recommended these and they are helping.  I had pain in my arch and behind my toes---pretty much gone!
3.0,"At first I thought ""these are great"" but then after awhile they started bothering the outer right side of my foot so I took them out. It feels at times like I am walking with a small golf ball under my foot in the middle to the outer right side.
I will try and get use to them since the Podiatrist recommended them."
5.0,Powe steps always fit and perform as expected. Fast shipping.
5.0,I need high arch support and these work terrifically well for me.
3.0,Did not help heel pain.
5.0,"My Physical Therapist said I have fallen arches and suggested these insoles.  As some suggested in the reviews, I wore them for several hours the first two days and then started to wear them all the time.  They have helped the pain I have had in my heal and balls of my feet.  Price was good and the delivery as promised."
4.0,I like this product a lot
5.0,"These are a little tough to rate in my case as my Plantar Fasciitis is one of the more severe cases.  I wore these for a couple of hours in my new KURU orthotic shoes.  There WAS some relief.  Great arch support and the heel is kept in place.  I will give them another try one the inflammations have subsided a little.  No matter what, these are GREAT insoles."
5.0,"Did not realize how bad my flat feet were.
My feet have no pain now, I feel like I walk and stand better too. It's a little wide in the shoe but all good!!!"
5.0,These are my second pair and will probably buy them again.
4.0,"These were purchased in hopes of putting off hip replacement surgery.  That didn't work, but I still wear them in my shoes."
5.0,"Wow, my mom has been talking about arch support and orthotics for years but not till I got these did I realize how right she was. It is life changing feeling the difference in your body and posture and balance. Love these ,great price, easy to cut and size when not using for sneakers."
4.0,I just put them in my shoes and felt almost instant relief.
4.0,"so far so good, only had them about 1 week"
4.0,"Good product, serves the purpose. Initially could not wear them but for 10 minutes and tried Samurai brand first for two weeks to get my arches acquainted, and then switched to this brand, and have kept them on my sneakers ever since. Great support."
5.0,These were recommended by my podiatrist for my flat feet. It took a couple of days to get used to. I have been wearing a pair every weekend while working in the yard and they have helped relieve my pain in the left ankle where I have bone spurs and osteoarthritis. They have been a tremendous help. I just bought a second pair for my dress shoes that I will use when I am standing for long periods.
5.0,great product at a great price.
5.0,"These have totally turned around my plantars fasciitis. Granted I have made some other changes to my shoe routine (for example, no longer where cutsie sandals or flip flops with no support), I use these in my workout shoes and have seen tremendous improvement to the pain I was having."
5.0,Love em.  Totally help with my flat feet.  A new pair is like walking on clouds.
5.0,Worked great. I have used power steps for several years.
5.0,"I have flattening feet due to aging.  My podiatrist recommended these, and they work great.  No more pain."
5.0,"They didn't cure my plantar fascitis,  but they do relieve a lot of pain."
4.0,"I put these in each pair of shoes that I wear, both tennis shoes and dress shoes."
5.0,very comfortable
5.0,highly recommend this product. Podiatrist recommended the orthotics for my walking shoes and they are comfortable and hold up well.
4.0,Fine
5.0,very comfortable to use at least 12 hours
5.0,Does a great job supporting my flat feet
5.0,Really helped my husband's foot problem.
5.0,Powerstep has saved my feet. They give me the support needed to make it through the day and not have pain in my feet.
5.0,Great for high arches/plantar fasciitsis!
5.0,"Always buy these, next best thing to custom."
5.0,I don't wear shoes without these.
5.0,"I started using these about 5 years ago.  I that time my feet were in so much pain, I could hardly walk.  I got immediate relief and I will never be without."
3.0,"I originally bought these for better support wearing my casual shoes (Clarks/superstars). However, even with the soles taken out, they raise my feet way too high within the shoes! It either constricts my feet or has my heels almost falling out the back of the shoes.

The saving grace was that they worked fine in my basketball shoes. However, I would think twice before getting these for your regular, casual shoes."
4.0,"These worked temporarily for me, and fit perfectly.  Unfortunately, the arch support wasn't quite enough.  After about a month of wearing them, my feet started pressing inward again, and I began to have pain in my large toes."
1.0,I liked the fit and feel but the toe wore out in just two months.  I got a blister on my toe from this.  See photo.
5.0,"These are great. I bought a second pair so that I have one for my work shoes and one for my running shoes. I have bought another model of Powerstep orthotic that lasted me several years, and I have no reason to think this also will not last several years."
5.0,These pinnacles have helped me tremendously with my heel pain! Thank you!
5.0,"These are by far the best inserts I have found for my chronic plantar fasciitis. My foot doctor recommended these inserts, and I was happy to find that they are at a far lower price on Amazon than my foot doctor sells them for. I have a couple of pairs, and slip them into almost every pair of shoes I wear."
4.0,"Wore them for four days, it's hard to make a review and only wearing a couple days.  I believe it is helping my feet."
5.0,Working so far.
5.0,"Better than custom and sooooooo much cheaper, wish I would have tried these before I wasted money on custom!!"
5.0,"These are wonderful! We originally had my husband fit for these at the Bone store but now buy them from here. The fit is perfect and true to size. They give arch support and make wearing boots all day standing, comfortable."
4.0,just a little thicker than previous ones so I can only wear with limited shoes at hand.
5.0,Very good arch support.  Only problem is can only be worn in walking shoes or athletic shoes.  Too wide for ladies dress shoes.  Powerstip makes a 3/4 size that's thinner for dresser shoes.
1.0,"So flimsy. I have the worst fallen arches, These did nothing for support."
5.0,Product arrived as expected. Love these orthotics.
5.0,Been using for years!  Solved my plantar fasciitis problem!
5.0,It provides extra support for my high arches.  I have used these for a few years now.  The Amazon price is the best!
5.0,"Without these inserts, my feet have terrible pain within a few hours of standing."
5.0,Extremely good support. All day comfort.
5.0,Works great.
5.0,My son has flat feet and he says these are very supportive and comfortable for him. He had no problem adjusting to them.
5.0,Best things ever. Our 5th pair.
5.0,Insoles solved my aching feet. Could not make it without them. Best foot product ever.
4.0,Great for replacing worn out insoles when you need extra support.
4.0,so far so good.
5.0,"This is only an initial impression, but after using the Powerstep Pinnacle insoles for a day, a lingering callus did not feel irritated. Some people have said, they don't want arch support that makes each arch feel over a barrel. I was willing to give it a try. A couple of years ago, a doctor removed a couple of calluses and said I had flat feet. Since then I developed another callus, and have tried to work with it on my own. I learned to sand away most of it, and cushion it, but it kept feeling irritated as I walked, and trying to grow back. If I had flat feet, maybe my insoles didn't lift them enough. Like I said, one day wearing Powerstep Pinnacle insoles, plus cushioning with moleskin, and the callus was quiet."
5.0,"Great arch, very comfortable in my golf shoes."
5.0,Very nice. Work great. Recommended  by my foot doctor.
5.0,"Fit well, great support, good price"
5.0,"Nice product,helps my 70 year old feet."
4.0,"I am recovering from a severe injury and have run through quite a few orthotic brands. I can only wear one specific shoe at the moment, but the original insole was too flat-footed, hence the custom insoles. I have very high arches and was afraid these wouldn't be enough support. Others I have tried have provided more arch support. these are very soft and cushy, but so far, they have held up my arches pretty well. I severely injured my ankle, so if the arches are not held up, my ankles turn and hurt, so although I can tell these are not quite as firm as others, they are doing the job!!! And my arches are very high! My other issue is a cracked heel bone, and that's where these beat all the others. The extra softness lets me actually walk. (Bone technically healed, but the lingering pain will be going on for a while....)"
4.0,"Was told by my podiatrist to purchase this product, and it seems to help my issue with my Achilles."
5.0,Much cheaper than buying at doctor office. Will buy again!
5.0,I had chronic foot issues from too much tennis and power steps are lifesavers. I can't play without them. They also last a really long time!
5.0,I highly recommend these inserts. They are my second pair. Great price on Amazon 
5.0,Perfect for running.
5.0,I'm always happy with power step insoles. My mom was suffering with planter fasciitis and as soon as she put these soles in her shoes it went away almost immediately. She couldn't be happier and she is now part of the  power step family.
5.0,LOVE AND NEED THESE - PLEASE KEEP CARRYING THEM!!
5.0,Best insoles you can buy! All my shoes have a set.
5.0,"My husband is on his feet all day. These work for him. Happy feet, happy back."
4.0,For cushioning with mild arch support.
5.0,"I've used Powerstep orthotics for over 8 years.  I never use my $375.00 prescription orthotics, because they're not as comfortable."
5.0,"If you have any foot issues, give it a try. You won't regret it"
4.0,"Not magic, but very helpful for plantar fasciitis.  I checked that they can be worn comfortably all day, but that's after wearing them for a few hours each day to get used to them - not recommended to jump right into all day wear if you haven't already been wearing these or something similar.  The price on Amazon was about half what a local retailer charges."
5.0,"Arrived on time, packed and shipped properly. Perfect fit, a must recommend if your on your feet all day."
5.0,One of the best thing I've ever done for my two feet since putting on shoes!!
5.0,Perfect. Just like the ones my wife was finally replacing at a great price.  She's happy so I'm happy!
5.0,Like them a lot.
4.0,Very satisfied with my powerstep insoles
4.0,Recommended by my podiatrist. Time will tell if they provide any relief.
4.0,As advertised
5.0,"At first I found these insoles to be stiff and I wondered how they would work for my very intense heel pain and foot fatigue. I could feel them large and bulky under my feet. But then I wore them on long walks, wore them at the mall and I noticed that at the end of the day my feet did not hurt. What a surprise! I feel like they put my feet in the correct position. I tested these out in a major way recently with a close family member being in the hospital. I did lots and lots of walking and standing. Fast walking, slow walking, you name it. I don't think I could have survived without them. They've held up well. No separating of materials or fraying."
5.0,Comfort
5.0,They work perfectly in my sneakers. I'm on my feet all day and they make my feet feel great! I would never be without them.
5.0,"Very good product, price is right"
5.0,Sort of fits too tight in some shoes but very good for those who have planter fasciitis
5.0,Well made and comfortable.
3.0,Could be a little stiffer.  Not sure they'll last too long being worn every day.
5.0,"I work on my feet all day, walking around on concrete. My feet would hurt so bad while I walked that I had to find something. First I put wedges under my insoles to bow my feet, thinking that was the issue. I tried those Dr. Scholls inserts that don't work and finally found these wonderful insoles! They pretty much cured my foot pain overnight. I combine them with hiking shoes that have hard plastic support under the arches. Besides having tired feet at the end of the day, no foot pain!"
5.0,"I have been wearing them in my running shoes for over 10 years.  I have slight pronation in both feet and these add the support I need to help with this problem.  I run about 3 days a week or a total of about 18 miles.  I buy new running shoes about once a year, however others may prefer to buy shoes more often in this mileage category.  When replacing my running shoes I look into the need to replace the orthotics as well but only do so if I don't like the way they are wearing.  I have gotten more than 1 shoe change out of them (1 year) but you need to be careful to inspect them at least annually due to the fact that once they decide to give out (usually in the arch where the seam of hard plastic meets the softer front piece) they go fast.  I missed a small crack in the area outlined and about 4 miles into an 8 mile run the hard plastic broke through the soft padding and caused a nasty blister on my arch that took a long time to heal."
5.0,"I've used these for years,,, won't go without them,,"
5.0,I have been using these inserts for several years. Still doing their job well.
5.0,"Bought these as a second pair of shoes after receiving a previous set of insoles as a gift. They're insanely comfortable and convert tough shoes into all-day shoes. They fit as expected in every shoe I've tried (the same size fits in all of my shoes) and I can be on my feet in desert boots for 8 hours at a time without worry. If your shoes don't have built in support, you've got to get Powerstep insoles! The price sounds a little steep at first, but they hold up great. I've been wearing the first set for over a year with barely any signs of wear. They're still just as comfortable and are holding together well. There's nothing negative to say about these insoles -- I wish I had started wearing them earlier and I think everyone would benefit from having them in almost any shoe.

Also, if the shoe feels very tight against the top of your foot after putting in the insole, don't worry. It'll take a little time for the shoe to stretch out to accommodate, but every pair of shoes has. Don't worry that your shoes will be uncomfortable forever. It probably takes about a day or so to get stretched out and then they'll be fine from then on."
5.0,Fits as expected and feels great when walking.
5.0,I'm a nurse on my feet for 13 hours a day and these have amazing support! My podiatrist has recommended these to me because of low arches and plantar fascitis and these have saved my feet!
5.0,These have great arch support woke still being flexible enough for comfort during running and hiking.
4.0,"Bought these  for someone else, but they seem to be satisfied."
4.0,Perfect so far
4.0,Very helpful for walking.
1.0,Uncomfortable.
5.0,Got these before and they really helped my feet.
5.0,Great product! My plantar fasciitis felt better almost immediately after putting these insoles in my work boots. Much better than super feet! Super feet feels as though you are walking on concrete.
5.0,Great product first recommended by foot doctor.
5.0,It is an excellent insert! It was recommended by my Dr.
3.0,"Be careful not to trim too much. The insert should have a line for each size , so you can trim accurately and does not ! I trimmed my inserts a little too short !"
5.0,Like the stability of the insole in the arch.  Seems like a great product for the price right out of the gates.
5.0,Great arch support and heel cushioning!  I've purchased enough of them to replace the inserts in all of my athletic shoes. They've been particularly helpful in relieving some of my bunion pain.
2.0,"Very little padding. Very firm. A lot of arch support, but will hurt your feet if you have a flat foot. Quality is not good. Loosing upper fabric layer at some places after a few times of wear."
5.0,Recommended by my foot doctor.
5.0,"I have plantar fasciitis and these work perfectly. The only problem I have is that you don't know when they have lost their effectiveness. I know when I start experiencing pain, I wish they were made of hard plastic and lasted longer. I have a pair in every pair of shoes I own. They last with continued use 8-12 months."
5.0,"I have been wearing these for years and they provide good arch support and relieve my plantar fasciitis. That being said, it is necessary to replace them periodically because they wear out. I usually replace them every 6 months or so. This is still a better deal than having a ""permanent"" pair done by a podiatrist. I use these in two pairs of tennis shoes and my hiking boots."
4.0,"These inserts helped out my shoes enough that I can wear them again.  l had given up wearing two pairs of shoes that had originally been great, but after a year of wearing them, they had lost their support and cushioning, even though the rest of the shoe is still holding up great.  With these inserts, the shoes are wearable again. Inserts are certainly cheaper than a new pair of athletic shoes!"
5.0,"I have plantar fasciitis in both feet and have been using prescription orthotics for several years.  These have been a great substitute for me, I've been using the Powersteps for well over five years now with no return of the pain induced by plantar fasciitis, even considering I spend all day at work walking around on concrete.  Depending on the shoe, I use the full length or the 3/4 length version, both perform equally well for me.  I can heartily recommend them!"
5.0,"The difference this made for my feet while at work (on my feet for hours, concrete floors) is staggering. My feet don't ache anymore after a long shift. These are great!"
5.0,fit good
5.0,My husband has plantar fasciitis.  He always gets a pair of the Powerstep Pinnacle inserts when he purchases a new pair of tennis shoes.  They are great support and keep his feet from hurting due to his condition.
5.0,fits great came on time
5.0,I have had these insoles before they are just what I need for work since I have calluses on the balls of my feet and 2  morons neuroma surgeries. I am a bartender and could not work without these insoles!!!!!
5.0,I have worn Powerstep inserts in my shoes since I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis several years ago. They make a huge difference in the comfort of my shoes - & my feet.  I seldom go anywhere without them.
1.0,"The problem with these inserts is that they lifted my heel up and changed the way my shoes fit. Shoes that used to be fine no longer fit right and gave me blisters. This was one of those ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" things that really did not work out."
5.0,My foot is in between 11 and 12 and these size 12 insoles fit perfectly into my shoe
5.0,"I use these in my running shoes.  I put in about 15-30 miles a week, and race mostly half marathons or less.  They have helped with chronic foot pain, shin splints, and hip problems just by fixing my gait.  My shoes last 4-6 months, and these usually last a year.  In some of my other shoes, even longer because of the lighter wear.  The layers have never separated like some other inserts I have tried.  In all my years of wearing these (this is the first pair I bought on Amazon), I have only ever had one pair that had a funny spot that gave me a blister after a few miles.  Most people probably would never notice if they were using them for lighter wear.  I also use them in my metatarsal-plate work boots; full disclosure: I typically only wear them for a day at a time, weeks or months apart.  They greatly helped making those bearable."
5.0,I have purchased four pairs of these.  They do the job as well as my custom-made orthotics for my plantar fasciitis pain.
5.0,They where perfect love them.
5.0,makes my feet feel much better
5.0,Better than expected! Thanks!!!!
5.0,Second pair!
4.0,Litel too hard
1.0,Don't waste your money
5.0,Great product. Highly recommend.
5.0,great
5.0,I've used this brand for years and have no plans to change.
5.0,I love these and can't say enough about them.  I purchase a couple of these every year because of wear and tear (I teach group fitness classes and am very physically active).
5.0,Great
5.0,"I was convinced that comfortable arc support insoles for my plantar fasciitis didn't exist, but luckily I was wrong. These Powersteps are amazing! They are firm and fit perfectly into every size 13 shoe I own. I can't even wear shoes without them anymore...I'm not sure how I was able to walk before I bought these!"
5.0,Very comfortable. I have plantar fasciitis and these insoles help a lot. I recommend taking the insolesout that came in your shoes and replacing them with these. Otherwise your shoes might be too tight.
5.0,"I'm very happy with this product, and will by them again."
5.0,Can't run without them.
4.0,"Actually, these women's 11-11.5 (men's 9-9.5) fit like women's 10-10.5. I have found that whenever one buys unisex sizing, the difference is 1 size bigger for women than for men. I submerged my misgivings and went by the Powerstep size guide and their women's 10-10.5 were too small, necessitating an exchange.  Be aware these orthotics raise one's heels sufficiently that in some lo-rise shoes, when you remove the insole and replace with these, your heel may be elevated enough to start slipping.  I am going to use these in 2 pairs of high-top boots that I have, where it doesn't matter."
5.0,Good support for someone who has suffered with Plantar Fasciitis.
4.0,"These are sturdy and well made. However I have a rather small style of running shoe and these make my heel sit awkwardly for now. Maybe once I use them enough to wear them down a little they'll be okay. I bought them due to high arches and metatarsal pain. They fixed the pain from that, but they're causing my heels to hurt a little. I think that it's just the shape of my foot and the way I had been walking previously, and not the actual insoles. I can tell they're fixing my gait and posture. But I have some aches from it. Hopefully I'll adjust. I'll update again after a few weeks"
5.0,These are very comfortable and provide good support
5.0,Yes
5.0,Only have used for a week. The support seems very good and comfortable. Just as good as the orthotics designed for me from my podiatrist and definitely less expensive.
5.0,Felt good on my feet.  Easy to insert as well.
3.0,Expressed hope that the model name on the packaging.
5.0,"My podiatrist recommended these for plantar fasciaitis, I bought a pair from him and they certainly made a difference but at 40$.  Much cheaper here which makes it easier to replace them as needed about 9 months for me.  I do wear them at work where am on my feet most of the time even if my pf isn't acting up because they simply feel good."
5.0,Powerstep works and feels great on your feet.
5.0,"My husband loves these insoles.  He has had plantar fasciitis (heel spurs) twice and his last podiatrist recommended these.  He has a set in every pair of his shoes and swears by them.  These insoles are not the soft gel type, but more the molded arch support type which he likes.  The heel is held in place by the cupped area and with the arch support it helps to keep the feet from moving around too much.  I hope they keep making these because it beats the idea of foot surgery!"
5.0,Helps my feet a lot.  Will continue to use and buy them.  Went from always being in pain after walking or running to being back to normal.
3.0,Purchased for someone else
5.0,Comfort and support are superior
5.0,Great product for a reasonable price.
1.0,Not worth the money. Hasn't helped my feet one bit and they don't fit properly according to their size chart.
5.0,Eliminated pain caused by cist on bone.
5.0,Great insole!
5.0,Awwome
5.0,Planning to buy another pair. GREAT
5.0,What I expected
5.0,"Being using this product for years,  No Planters fasitis any more"
5.0,Great support
5.0,They are wonderful
5.0,OMG!!! Couldn't believe how comfortable they are...It supported my feet without any getting used to..This was recommended by my Podiatrist...
5.0,"I got these for my husband who has plantar fascistic.  when we visited the shoe store that helps fit you with correct insoles and shoes they recommended these insole.  I bought him a pair from them but the price was crazy so when he asked me to get him a second pair I went straight to Amazon to order them. Since he has been using these insoles in his work boots and the shoes he wears any other time, he no longer has the pain in his foot."
5.0,"I love these orthotics! I used to use Lynco orthotics. These are just as good, if not better (I've heard that Lynco's quality has gone down and haven't purchased them in a few years). These are much cheaper, too."
5.0,One of the best inserts I have owned.  Help greatly with heel issues.
5.0,purchased these for my mother who is 80 and these are the only ones she will wear-feel so good!!
5.0,They were perfect!
5.0,"Fits well, provides immediate comfort."
4.0,Good
5.0,Good inserts for pronation.  My podiatrist recommended them and she was right on.
4.0,I like these a lot for my foot- which has high arches.  Would buy again and probably will.
5.0,"Just wish they were thinner so not to raise your foot in the shoe as much.  I always need to take out the original shoe insole when possible if the shoe fits too snugly with insole in.  These are the same insoles my podiatrist's sells in his office, the first two times I pd. him $50 for them....never again, Amazon has best pricing.  I also buy the pinnacle max insoles which cost a little more.  I wear them daily, all day long and they last at least 6-8 months before I get ""wear holes"" in a few spots where my big toe and ball of foot put the most pressure I guess.  Wish I could wear them in a sandal/flip-flop type shoe.  Had plantar ficiitis surgery on both feet and these provide good arch support."
5.0,"If you have flat feet these are great.  Been using these for years.  Make sure you get the newer ones that say pinnacle, as the older versions do not and are not as cushioned."
5.0,"The insole is comfortable.  I expected the arch support to be harder, but it is fine as is.  I liked that I didn't need to trim it."
5.0,I've used these for a few years. They are terrific! Sturdy and long-lasting.
5.0,works great for my feet! a better alternative for those who cannot tolerate superfeet.
5.0,I have a very wide foot. It works..Have bought orthodontics for years spent $1000s this product works
5.0,"Love these inserts! My feet, especially my heels, do not hurt. Will continue to buy this for all
my shoes."
5.0,These are the only inserts I use. My plantar fasciitis went away and I no longer have foot pain.
5.0,Great product!  A++
5.0,"Great orthotics. I was first given these (a similar model of Powerstep) by my Podiatrist like 10 years ago. I don't really need orthotics but often replace the inserts of shoes/sneakers and it's like getting a new outer sole. I don't always wear them but definitely put them in sneakers when they begin to wear down and it really helps support and cushioning. I had other orthotics and they fit worse, so this fits better than others (my feet are slightly wide and arch is slightly low and I don't need orthotics but these help when you need to spend 8-9 hours on your feet."
5.0,"I was introduced to these insoles by my shoe store. The gentleman who owns it has been fitting people for 50 years and these are what he swears by. My only problem is he is expensive. I found these on line and bought a pair to replace a worn out pair. I wear a size 13 and did not have to modify them in any way. I am 6'3"", 335 lbs. and am on my feet for 12 hours a day in my work boots. I walk, climb, drive, push, and pull all day long putting a great deal of wear on my feet. Under MY circumstances I get about 4 months out of a set of these before the padding begins to pull away from the sole. Not a bad life expectancy considering my size and my occupation as warehouser."
5.0,This order was a replacement for my previous pair of this same brand which had started to wear out after approximately 250 miles walking.
5.0,Great product. Much cheaper than Superfeet.
5.0,I have used the Powerstop Pinncale Orthotics for years and these really support my arches and help reduce my foot pain. Aging is wonderful thing but it means decreased fat around the pads of the foot and these arches have done a good job in keeping my feet feeling happy.
5.0,"Powersteps are the Best in my mind,they make a pair for every foot condition:)"
4.0,work well and easy to trim to correct size
5.0,These work well for me.  I have a high arch and they give me just the right amount of support.  I trim them to fit my shoes - they are easy to trim - but they are very durable.
5.0,"Right now, I could not walk without them.  These insoles put just enough pressure on my arch to relieve a lot of the pain I'd feel in my heel were they not there."
5.0,Old feet still walking.  Help greatly!
5.0,met all my expectations
5.0,I am extremely satisfied with my Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics for provide excellent support for my shoes and I would highly recommend them to anyone.
4.0,Thumbs up
5.0,Great in steel toe work boots!
5.0,As expected.
2.0,"They hurt my feet, i had to return them."
5.0,"Use these in all my shoes, and have used them for years since they control plantar fasciitis well (for me)."
5.0,I have plantar fasciitis and I usually buy Superfeet insoles that are pretty pricey. I took a chance and bought this less expensive brand. It takes a couple of days to get used to the arch but after that they are great. I don't think I will  be going back to Superfeet!
5.0,good product and helpful for arch support
4.0,god fit
5.0,I had purchased these insoles many years ago when my podiatrist recommended them.  They worked for me then and they still work.  Hopefully it will clear up my problem completely.  My feet do feel better just in the few days I have been wearing them.
5.0,"Great inserts, buy yourself some!"
4.0,These are great for my plantar issues. They stay sturdy and supportive. I own 3 pairs of these and buy them when purchasing new shoes. I would recommend them for those suffering from flat  feet and runners who need the extra support.
5.0,"Very useful
I like them"
5.0,I am very pleased with the fit in my New Balance shoes. I walk 2 miles almost daily and wanted more support.
5.0,Excellent insert.
5.0,Work just as advertised
5.0,"Even my foot doctor recommends these,"
5.0,Comfortable. I will buy more.
5.0,"The insoles immediately relieved my foot pain, and significantly reduced my knee pain too.  I am flat-footed, and had stress fracture to the cuboid bone, with an injury to the same cuboid.  Anyhow, my foot was in constant pain and my doctor (G.P.) recommended these for some relief.  They've done so well that I ordered another set for shoes that I wear regularly.  The only downside it that they use up a significant amount of depth within the shoe."
5.0,I've been using them in my walking shoes for several years.  They were recommended to me by my podiatrist
5.0,Comfortable over the counter orthotics with cushion.  Think superfeet with cushion.
4.0,I have low arches and use custom orthotics. I expected a little more pronounced arch support. Still they do a pretty good job.
5.0,"Was having a problem with flat feet and was told to find shoes with an arch.  Well I thought, what about the shoes I already have and this was the answer."
5.0,Good fit and feel comfortable
3.0,"These are OK.  I have a posterior tibial tendonitis in my left foot that causes it to overpronate and my arch has started falling.  I was looking for arch support insoles that didn't try to do too much in other areas-- I didn't want a lot of heel cushioning or pads on the ball of the foot.  These are pretty comfortable. The arch is in the right spot (although the arch is a little low for me) and the heel cup doesn't lift my heels up too high, but they're WAY too wide.  They are trimmable, but I don't think that applies to the sides.  If they had a narrow option, they'd be great."
5.0,Only insert my husband will wear
5.0,I have purchased these before.  I have them in both my work shoes and walking shoes. Will buy again!
5.0,This is my third pair they are great .... My dog has eaten two pair .... so I guess they taste  good also :-)
5.0,These are really nice and fit as expected. Price was a lot lower than the shoe stores. So comfy!
5.0,I tend to roll my feet inward when walking. These really helped correct my step. These are the best insoles I have ever used. Firm support yet comfortable. Work 12 hour shifts wearing safety toe shoes and on my feet at least 11 hours of the shift.
5.0,I suffer from planter fascia and tarsel tunnel.  These have been an absolute lifesaver and fit great in all my shoes providing me with great act and foot support.  My podiatrist ordered me the first pair through a Medical supply company and I loved them so much I ordered three more pairs here on Amazon so I don't have to keep switching them out in my shoes.  I won't wear a pair of shoes anymore without them!
5.0,Well done. All the bumps seem to be in all the right places.
3.0,OKAY
5.0,"These orthotics work beautifully for me. They fit my shoes really well, and provide the support necessary to keep pain from my plantar fasciitis and tendinitis under control. I'm really enjoying using them. Price is very reasonable for pain relief."
5.0,Comfortable
5.0,"There is a break-in period with the insoles. Start a couple of hours the first day and add an hour each day until you have all-day comfort with support. I am transitioning from a set of insoles that are over a year old and showing their wear.  I am on my feet eight hours a day, five days a week, so I really appreciate the support these insoles provide.
I usually rotate three pairs of shoes each week.  It keeps the insoles, and the shoes fresher, longer."
4.0,"The Powerstep Pinnacle Premium Orthotic Shoe Insoles in size ""Mens 11-11.5"" are a perfect fit for my Red Wing 5608 Afton Casual Shoes in size 10 EE, they are literally almost an exact match, being the same width, and only 1/4"" longer than the original worn out insoles. These have restored to life a favorite old pair of shoes."
5.0,"Great insoles, they seem to work very well, recommended by my podiatrist."
5.0,good fit and comfortable
5.0,"Sizing is accurate. Very comfortable to wear, provides the necessary arch support. Love them."
5.0,Fantastic relief for my feet.
5.0,"I suffered from plantar fasciitis until I tried these orthotics a couple of years ago. Now I buy a pair and install them whenever I get a new pair of shoes. They are far superior, in my opinion, to all the cheap insoles one finds easily, and they have banished my foot pain. I love them!"
5.0,Adds the arch support needed to all footwear in a cost effective way.
5.0,I put this in my favorite shoes and made them even better.  I highly recommend this for excellent all day support.
5.0,Great support! Replaced the inserts in my Dr Martins
5.0,Wonderful support Just ordered another pair!
5.0,Love it.  Great arch support.
5.0,"Great Orthotics, Excellent Support"
3.0,Its Ok. Not very sturdy arch support. i think I would like to go with a different version that has more arch support. These I believe are not really aggressive as I'd like to have had. A lot better than anything your average shoe comes with.
5.0,Great support.  Works great.  Recommended.
4.0,Very good for the price.  I like that it has an arch. Seems to fit into all of my athletic shoes.  The fit seems to match exactly how it is stated by the company.  Would buy again
5.0,AAAAA+++++
5.0,These are very comfortable inserts!  Wonderful arch support too.
5.0,"FOOT DOCTOR REQUEST--THAT I USE THEM.  THEY  DO HELP ,"
5.0,Best insole I've ever owned
5.0,Fit was great. Best insoles ever.
5.0,Great relief for my high arches!
5.0,I bought two here for the price I paid for one at the podiatrist's office. They work great and last about a year wearing them everyday.
5.0,"Love these! They turn any shoe, with a removable insole, into a comfortable walking shoe. I have flat and arthritic feet, and these make a world of difference for me"
5.0,"The king of the inserts. I have very high, rigid arches, and narrow feet. These make all shoes better. I'm also a fan of the High Arch Sof Sole Fit Series, the but Powersteps are a lot cheaper. I recommend a little foam or something between the shoe and the arch to prevent your shoes from either pronating or supinating, depending on your alignment. I'm a slight supinator, so having an arch support that touches my foot really helps me to pressure down through the arch, and not just on the outside of my foot.

P.S. I've had a couple of pairs of these for years. They look pretty beat up, but they have really held their shape. These will long outlast your shoes. Don't throw them out! Reuse reuse reuse."
5.0,Use these every day in different shoes after my specialist recommended them. My feet have felt hugely better & I walked for miles on cobblestones in  Rome for a week & didn't have any problems; while my husband in his walking shoes & gel insoles was in pain & got a blister. So glad I use them.
4.0,Good basic insole. Not as supportive as my Vionic.
5.0,the best for PF
5.0,Great product. Exact fit as described
5.0,Who knew that an over the counter orthotic could be more comfortable than my custom fit pair. I like the way these fit so I bought a second pair so that I don't have to move them in and out of my shoes and sneakers.
1.0,Very disappointed. I shopped around online a lot and based my purchase on the reviews. This we're a great disappointment. Did not offer the cushion or support I was looking for.
5.0,"Hands down THE BEST insoles I have ever tried. I have been working 12 hour shifts, standing on concrete, for 10 years now. I have tried so many different insoles to alleviate some of the pain associated with my job. $40 Timberlands. $50 Dr. Scholls. You name it. None of them can even touch these. They were referred to me by a family member, because she had foot issues, and her doc told her to try these. Well i had to give it a shot, and I am so glad I did. I can literally work a 12 hour shift with just the slightest foot ache. And when I say slight, I mean slight! Did not have to cut to size. It fit my boot perfectly. I will be ordering at least one back up pair, in case this product becomes discontinued."
5.0,"I have been using these inserts for years, they have essentially eliminated the issues I was having with planter fasciitis. I wear them in all my dress, casual, tennis, work and sport boots."
5.0,My podiatrist recommended these years ago. I have worked standing on concrete for 40 tears. These inserts have saved my feet and legs. I love them. No more foot pain for me!
5.0,Love these things.  I am trying to not have bad feet when I get older!  These are perfect for high arch feet!
4.0,"Great product,  I hate that I have to wear them but my foot demands it.  They fit very well in my Asics tennis shoes, almost could keep the orginal insert in .  I bought 2 pair this time so I don't procrastinate as much when needing to purchase another pair."
5.0,I've used these for several years.  Very good for me.
4.0,"I bought these to prevent future running injuries. They were recommended by my orthopedic doctor. I believe they have helped to prevent injuries in the last couple of months I've had them, but they do not prevent injuries entirely. I only ran a mile yesterday in them and I think I've torn a tendon in my leg. They help but they don't work miracles!"
5.0,"Helped w/ plantar, walk about 8-10 miles a day , work boots on concrete and gravel"
1.0,Bought these because of the stellar reviews and had high hopes for sore feet relief. Unfortunately my feet hurt more after using these. I gave them an extra couple of days in case they needed to break in--to no avail.
4.0,"It reduced 40 percent of my discomfort  heels
That make me got the 2nd pair"
5.0,"Bought these with the noene invisible for my wife to get rid of her arch pain. The pain disappeared immediately and hasn't returned. She's still using them months later, and their still holding up unlike her shoes, she's on to another pair with the same insoles."
5.0,"I bought these for my husband, he uses them in his running shoes and swears by them."
5.0,"I have a few pair of these orthotics and use them in all my shoes. I also use them in my ski boots.

They really provide good arch support and were instrumental in recovering from plantar fasciitis which I developed last spring after a relatively short jog. They also have prevented the re-occurrence of plantar fasciitis, even though I'm jogging more often and farther than when I developed the condition.

They are worth the money."
5.0,"I love these!  I have tried several other pairs, from the cheap ones you buy at Walmart to the ones the doctor recommended thru a medical supplier.  These are very affordable and work wonderfully.

I had Plantar Fasciitis and was struggling at work.  I am up and down all day and most days I walk 15 or more miles.  I was in near constant pain.  In combination with the right exercise for my condition, no more flat shoes and these inserts I no longer have any issues at all.

I have these in my work boots and when I am off for several days wearing my other shoes, I can tell a difference.  I will be ordering these again.  I have also given the product info to many of the people I work with and they have ordered them."
5.0,Fit is true to size and easy to use right out of the box. Very good performance so far!
4.0,This is the second pair I have bought. They really do help support my feet and relieve the discomfort of plantar fasciitis.
4.0,Same fit. Good for high arch
5.0,My planter fasciitis has not bothered me since I started using these in all my shoes.
4.0,"I've only worn them a few days now but they seem to be working great.  I have plantar fasciitis and walking has been tough after a few hours,  with these in my shoes my feet feel good enough that I can keep working.  I ordered another pair for a second set of shoes.  Time will tell how well they last but they seem to be of pretty good quality."
5.0,"I've used these same inserts for years.  A must if you're going to wear shoes for an extended period of time.  I even put the ""retired"" pair in my house shoes."
5.0,Very happy so far. I had very painful arch pain and now its gone. I've tried others and this worked.
5.0,Good
5.0,My second pair. My first pair were from the foot doctor.  These feel great and were a lot cheaper. Also received them a day earlier than expected
5.0,Really seem to help
5.0,I bought these for my son who has over pronation. They are comfortable and help with plantar facitis too.
1.0,"I've been wearing Powerstep for over a decade because I used to have Plantar Fasciitis.  The heal of my left foot started to become sore again so I decided to replace my Powerstep insoles because they were old.  I thought this pair would be great because there was extra padding.  Long story short; Plantar Fasciitis back in both feet & tore the Plantar Fascia in right foot due to the added cushion.  II wish that I would have replaced them with the same exact Powerstep without padding.  I've been on a leave of absence from work & I have been in PT for over a month.  I switched inserts to Superfeet with maximum heal support & Plantar Fasciitis is slowly getting better.  I do like Powerstep, but this particular one caused a lot of problems for me.  So in closing, if it's not broke don't fix it!  I should have stuck with original Powerstep inserts & none of this would have happened.  Hope this helps.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerstep-Unisex-Pinnacle-Insole-Blue-Blue-6-6-5-M-US-Women-4-4-5-M-US-Men/dp/B000KPML3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerstep Unisex Pinnacle Insole ,Blue/Blue,6-6.5 M US Women/4-4.5 M US Men</a>"
5.0,Bought 2 pairs & love them.  They fit well and help tremendously with my low back problems and foot problems.  Would definitely buy these again!!
4.0,My 7th pair
5.0,I don't have flat feet or high arches but I am on my feet a lot and they have started to hurt recently. These insoles provide support and cushioning. I have had no foot pain since wearing them.
5.0,I got these on the suggestion from my Physical Therapist for my Plantar Fasciitis. I am a school nurse and wear them all day. Has really helped. I would suggest to any one.
5.0,"I'm going to buy more of these!!! They work great for me...work shoes, boots, and my wife is going to try them too!!"
3.0,"These insoles helped in my boots. Not as wide as expected.  While these help, I need an insole with more padding at the ball of my foot."
5.0,Excellent insole with good support.
5.0,For a guy with bad flat feet this really works well.  This product was recommended by my podiatrist .  bought it on Amazon it was much cheaper than the Doctors office
5.0,Good product!
4.0,"Excellent arch support with ample cushioning.  The longer shape of the arch support is more comfortable than Superfeet.  However, the heel cup was way too wide so I had to return them."
5.0,"I was just diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, which is painful and annoying. These insoles help me not feel pain when i walk or when sitting at work. A life saver!!!"
4.0,Thanks
4.0,Don't fit in any of my flat dress shoes but they do fit in my tennis shoes which is why I bought them.
5.0,"So far so good. I was a bit skeptical at first, but this seemed a low cost solution over doing what I have done before: nothing.
I have worn these for a few days now and they definitely make a difference. My feet no longer hurt when I get up in the morning, and I can now walk and stand all day long without pain. I would certainly recommend trying these over spending $$$$$$$$ at the Good Feet Store.
."
5.0,Very comfortable in the initial wearing.  Good price when I bought.
4.0,I have these in all my shoes now.  If I don't my feet start to hurt as my arch begins to flatten out.  Great insoles at a reasonable price.
1.0,"*Update*
I was initially quite happy with these. I had even given them 5 stars for a good fit and comfort. However, after only two months of use they have developed holes in the heel area. I spend alot of time walking at work but two months is ridiculous. The picture was taken just 65 days after they were delivered to my door. They are already being thrown away."
4.0,Real good insoles
5.0,These have been a great help with the plantar fascitis I have dealt with for 2 years. They actually helped more than the cortisone shot in my heel.
4.0,"Great support,I spend 8-11 hours a day on my feet the entire time. Could feel the difference the first day."
5.0,I have very flat feet which has caused ankle pain and plantar fasciitis.  These are amazing.  After wearing them just one time I could tell a huge difference.  The pain wasn't completely gone but it was greatly improved.  I have worn them for over a week now and have continued to see improvement.  I feel like I can walk like a normal person again with no limping.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with similar issues.
5.0,"Serious changed my life. A foot doctor told me to use these in my shoes because I have a hammer toe.  Pain gone.  They're cheaper here than in his office, and they last for more than a year, even with changing them from shoe to shoe."
5.0,excellent orthopedic inserts prescribed by my doctor.
5.0,"These are amazing! I have plantar fasciitis and these are incredibly helpful. The arch is high and firm and the heel cup is comfy. I use these in all my gym shoes (take out their insoles first) and won't wear shoes without them. You can't fit them into most shoes outside of gym shoes, as they are not streamlined/slim."
5.0,"I have ordered these inserts for my husband for at least 5 years. He has plantar fasciitis and the Powerstep Pinnacle inserts make being on his feet a lot easier. He wears them everyday and they last about 6-9 months before he tells me to order more. He has tried other inserts but they don't hold up nor give the support that these do. I highly recommend these for anyone that needs extra support for their feet, especially for plantar fasciitis."
5.0,"After trying many cures and remedies, these got rid of my plantar fasciitis!
I play tennis 5 times a week but had to stop for a while due to severe pain. After a week using these, I was able to get back on the court.
The are not magic, I still had to ice my feet and not play too much. But they helped a great deal."
5.0,Great product. Wear well
4.0,"Good support for a while but, wears out after walk about 5 months if worn everyday"
5.0,Brand recommended by my podiatrist.  Feel great!
5.0,like it
5.0,This is the best I have ever had my podiatrist recommend these to me
5.0,Great for plantar faciatis!
5.0,I've used these for years. They are the best insoles I've used.
5.0,"I have had plantar fasciitis for several years and have tried many footwear inserts. These inserts are the most comfortable I have found, the arch support sitting as desired. With other products the arch support typically sits too close to the heel of the foot and is extremely uncomfortable.  I highly recommend giving these a try"
2.0,"I wore these for a couple of months, hoping they would work as a cheaper alternative to the ones I had used for years, however in the end I went back and purchased the more expensive ones.  These were okay, although they definitely have more lift than I personally wanted, they gave me a slight pain in my arch that went away after a short time wearing them. One surprise side-effect that I originally attributed to my shoes was the pain on the top of my foot that I had while wearing these.  It seemed I couldn't tie my shoe loosely enough for my foot to not hurt unless it felt like it was about to fall off. After I replaced these I realized my shoes were not to blame, but these orthodics were.  However, what really drove me to replace them was the fact that I managed to wear a hole through them underneath the ball of my foot within 2-3 months of getting them.  My old footbeds lasted for years (embarrassing as it should probably be that I used them that long) and when they did start to wear out I didn't even realize at first because it didn't really affect the performance much, when these went it was very obvious when I wore them and slightly uncomfortable.  I do lead an active life, usually playing racquetball or running on a treadmill or going for a hike every day, and walking anywhere from 12000-20000 steps a day, but I still expected these to hold up longer than they did."
5.0,"I've been wearing Powersteps for several years now, and I'm very happy with them.  I keep a pair in my running shoes and my daily shoes.  While I may someday switch to a custom-made orthotic, these are very cost effective and tolerate both the daily use and running activities nicely."
5.0,These orthotic are very comfortable yet supportive as well. They fit well in the shoes and do not slide around under my foot. Would recommend these to anyone with plantar fasciitis.
5.0,I love my inserts. My feet feel great after standing on them for 12 hrs.
5.0,I used these for years and they never disappoint
5.0,"They work very well for me without trimming, Good product."
3.0,gives better support to your foot.
1.0,Not what I expected
5.0,Has helped so much with my plantar fasciitis. I could tell right away when I put these on the arch was higher. Love them!!
5.0,"I wear prescribed orthotic shoes with custom inserts,  since the shoes are  hiking and walking shoes,  they did not work well with Tennis,  Racquetball, or Bike riding.  I purchased these to go into my Tennis, RBall, and Biking Shoes.  Give a great arch support and feel wonderful.  The Powerstep Pinnacles was recommend by my Foot Doctor."
5.0,Went right inside women's hiking boots.
4.0,"While these do provide great arch support, they have not helped to heal my plantar fasciitis."
5.0,These were recommended by my podiatrist years ago for plantar fasciitis and worked.  Years later another podiatrist recommended for my foot that had been broken and has arthritis.  They provide tremendous support for the feet and even helps my back.
5.0,"Great product, highly recommend. If feet and ankles hurt this is an inexpensive way to go. I'm not saying they are cheap but they are a lot cheaper than going to a podiatrist and you get a great product. I am totally satisfied and I have been to a podiatrist. Thank You for the support."
5.0,"I'm 26. Not an old man. Suffering with Plantar Fasciitis for a year. These insoles were the best $25 I've ever spent. Finally some relief! All this time I thought that I needed more cushion in my heel but what I really needed was proper arch support. Will probably continue to wear these even after my plantar fasciitis heels.

They're a little awkward to wear at first but they did start helping the pain instantly. They aren't necessarily ""cushiony"" or ""comfortable."" They're thin, firm, stiff and contoured to provide proper arch support and heel isolation. Highly recommend."
5.0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerstep-Unisex-Pinnacle-Insole-Blue-Blue-8-8-5-M-US-Women-6-6-5-M-US-Men/dp/B000KPOMZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerstep Unisex Pinnacle Insole ,Blue/Blue,8-8.5 M US Women/6-6.5 M US Men</a>Last year I developed tendonitis in the Achilles tendon on the back of my heal. Along with wearing a medical boot for 6 weeks the DR recommded this insole for wearing in my shoes from now on.  I must say it has made a difference in the comfort and support I need in my shoes, I have always needed good shoes with arch support but since this tendonitis I need major support and these insoles fill that need. I have bought several pairs so they are in all of my favorite pairs of shoes, If your foot tends to tip in when wearing shoes these insoles will help with that."
5.0,Finally my husband found insoles that WORKS!!!! They work so well we bought 3 pair. They provide good stability and provides good supportin all the right places. It seems to align my foot properly. These work better than any other foot bed including custom orthotics (for a lot less money). One pair were put in an older pair on tennis shoes....they worked so well. So we are excited to use the others in the new tennis shoes. These shoes and foot beds work so well we bought another set. When you find something that really works for your feet it is best to buy 2 pair. Thank you for this great product.
5.0,"I did have to do some trimming, which was expected. These will replace previous pairs purchased."
5.0,"If you have foot pain from arch problems, these may really help. They were a big help for me. They are not cheap, but it is better than limping around."
5.0,"My gosh these are great. Love them. I was at a conference where I am on my feet for 12 hours straight multiple days in a row. I will tell you my feet did not hurt at all. My sister is an ER nurse she swears by them.

They are a bit thick, but if you can get past that you are looking at some amazing inserts. Highest rating I am ever giving."
5.0,"I worked as a physical therapy technician while I was pregnant. In my third trimester, I started getting plantar fasciitis, and my feet burned ALL day. The PT I worked with recommended I order these and try them for a few hours a day, working up to a full day as my feet got used to them. I didn't have ANY foot pain for the rest of my pregnancy. After having my baby, I still wear them as arch supports when I exercise or walk long distances. Amazing product."
4.0,They fit like I'm not wearing them.
5.0,"This was the answer to my problem. I would suggest taking these along and buying shoes a half size larger. Buying in the bundle is a great savings, too!"
4.0,"While I have only used these twice so far, the support in the shoe is great.  I have only worn them with dress shoes and will try athletic shoes soon"
4.0,Performs as expected and fit size 13 work boots.
5.0,Doctor recommended.  They're doing the job. They're comfortable and provide arch support in my shoes that are more for style than long walks.
5.0,"I work in the restaurant industry.  12 hour days on my feet are normal.  I have tried Abedo, Superfeet and other inserts prior to these.  Powerstep work the best and at a reasonable price ."
5.0,"This Is exactly what I wanted. No problems here. Not much to say about it other than it fulfills the needs that I wanted for this product. I enjoyed using this I guess? Seems reliable and trustworthy, but only time will tell. I've owned it for about 3 weeks, and it has no problems but I will give an update in a couple more weeks to see how it goes.

Though I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my review, my opinions are my own, honest, and completely unbiased. Please use this information to assist you in purchasing the correct product for you needs!"
5.0,I find it uncomfortable and painful to wear shoes with good support and these insoles now a must for me.
5.0,"I love them! Hurt a little at first but once broke in, best inserts I have ever tried"
4.0,"VERY STRONG MATERIAL...
MET ALL EXPECTATIONS"
1.0,"Horrible product.....didn't help the pain....in fact, made it worse "
5.0,These were recommended to me after I underwent surgery for a subtalor fusion by my orthopedic surgeon.  They are so comfortable and have a great arch support.
5.0,Great
5.0,"Have needed arch support for several years, have found that Pinnacle works best for me.
Whenever I purchase a new pair of shoes one of the first things I do is remove the support added into the shoe replacing it with the Powerstep."
5.0,I like powerstep insoles. I have several pairs. They offer great support for my high arches.
5.0,"I have these in every pair of shoes I own. I run and these are the best I have ever used. I will continue to buy them, until I find something better and I started wearing these about 10 years ago."
5.0,I thought that I'd give these a try before buying a new pair of shoes.  They make my hike so much better.
5.0,"I have been using this brand of insert for 6 years now and I love them!!  I am flat footed and have tried maybe 5 different brands of insert, so I can honestly say I would recommend these : )"
5.0,As advertised.
5.0,These have really helped and all my tennis shoes work better with them
5.0,It Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics have solived my foot pain. Love them#
5.0,These inserts are a critical part of staving off any more bouts of plantar fasciitis. Once I started using these it made a big difference.
4.0,"These insoles provide really great padding for the bottoms of my feet. They fit very nicely inside all my shoes without having to remove the original insole. The only problem I have is that the arch support is kind of in a weird place on my foot. It supports the arch closer to the heel of my foot when I need support closer to front pad (I wish I knew foot anatomy better to be able to describe this). Overall they were fine. I probably wouldn't buy these again, but I don't regret buying them either."
5.0,"Great product. Makes a significant impact. Ankles, knees, and back stopped hurting shortly after getting them."
5.0,Fit great!!!
3.0,"Not high enough arch support. OK but 1/4"" to 1/2"" higher would be better since I have very high arches."
3.0,"For the price I expected more, these are decent for running but you need some space in your shoes already otherwise these will cramp your feet because your shoes will be too tight on your feet(more of a problem on my end than the insoles themselves). Had some difficulty standing in these all day but they provide support and do not 'mush' down like cheaper insoles."
5.0,I had purchased these insoles at a athletic store and was impressed with the results. Finding the very same product at a much better price was a nice bonus.
5.0,Excellent Insoles
4.0,These orthotics work great for me. I'm on my feet all day at the factory and these are quite comfortable.
5.0,Great insoles for high arches
5.0,great product
5.0,"These are FABULOUS!!  It took a few days for my feet to get used to having such good support, but now I never leave without them!  These are 100 times better than Dr. Scholls.  I will ever go back!"
5.0,Great deal and 19$ cheaper than at the running store!
5.0,Best ones!
5.0,Feel great
5.0,"Husband's first day wearing them after having plantar fasciitis, and he says his heels have no pain! Loves them so much he wants to order 2 more for other shoes."
3.0,"This is a good insole but I thought it was like the one I purchased from podiatrist. Evidently there is a different one for consumer as opposed to medical. The one I got from dr., although it was power step, was far superior to this one. Not sure how to get one short of paying for dr visit, in the meantime, this one is adequate"
5.0,"I have used these for years.  They helped me so much after a bout with plantar fasciitis, and now I wear them in most of my shoes regularly."
1.0,"Horrible quality, extremely overpriced, and useless after just a few weeks of using them in my walking shoes!!! I ordered these Powerstep inserts hoping they would be better than the Reebok ones in my shoes, and boy was I wrong! These Powerstep inserts are pretty much useless after just a few weeks of use; I can't believe I paid over $20 for these! After the first week, the liner started to come undone, which was really aggravating because I could feel it kinking up under my heel. Then a few weeks later, the actual foam started to break up and off. That's right!!! The foam that is supposed to provide all this great support started to break off near the front of my left foot insert near the toes. Horrible quality and build! I wouldn't even pay $5 for this useless product. And in case you are wondering, I walk only....no running! That's right, they can't even handle a few weeks of walking without breaking! I attached a picture of what they look like now...pathetic! I also ordered Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx inserts (for a whopping $26) at the same time, and they had the same issue; they also had the liner and foam go bad in just a few short weeks. So, I would recommend steering clear of Powerstep products, and try something else, unless you only need them to last 2-3 weeks. I'm looking for an alternative now."
4.0,"These are working decent in my boots... I'm a corrections officer in a county jail and I stay on my feet for hours on end. My arch has been killing me and I was hoping these would be higher and firmer... and stay firm. They feel like they have collapsed a little after a few months of use. I can still feel them supporting my arch, but not putting nice pressure on it like I hoped. These are still excellent quality and have helped a ton however. I will buy this brand again... I just may look for the high arch variety, or maybe even something plastic."
5.0,Wouldn't think of walking without my Powersteps. I've been wearing them for ten years or so. They cured my pronation problems.
4.0,Fit perfectly in my shoes without trimming.
4.0,"They are a bit wide and short...but other than that they are very good....i got them exclusively for running to replace Lynco insoles that i have used for years, but the company changed them drastically, to the point i find them useless :-( The price of the Powerstep insoles is much better than Lynco too"
5.0,Helps to keep my  plantar fasciitis at bay
5.0,I have a heel spur and these allow me to work on my feet all day pain-free!
5.0,"These work well, especially in my boots. They are sturdy."
5.0,These have worked better than the custom insoles I had made.  I have bought enough of these to have a pair for each pair of Tennis shoes I wear to work.
5.0,"These insoles are great! I have flat feet and they help tremendously. They hurt at first, had to get used to having arch support, but now I have them in all my shoes."
4.0,Fit good.
5.0,"I'm a cardio fitness instructor in my 40's, and use these for my workouts as to preserve the life of them.  I always air-dry them after a workout.  Terrific support, and fit my foot pretty well.  I was sized for them in a specialty store, but buy them on Amazon (better price, convenience of shopping, one less thing on the ""to do"" list)."
5.0,These work great. Have them in all my shoes.
5.0,Great product helps with my knee pain to keep my feet from turning in as well ..
5.0,Good foot support.  You may have to use them gradually until you become comfortable with them.  They take a little getting used to.  Then you won't ever wear shoes or boots without having them because they help your feet so much.  They don't fit cowboy boots without some trimming.  Good in shoes and work boots.  Long lasting and washable.
5.0,"I had a bad case of plantar fasciitis a few years ago. The doctors said I may want to look into custom orthotics but in my experience those weren't very comfortable (no cushion) so on the advice of an associate at a local running store I tried these Powerstep insoles and they are AMAZING!! I been able to keep running, working out and doing high impact activity!!! Now I have multiple pairs of these insoles and use them daily."
5.0,"After wearing these for a week, I will NEVER go back to the drugstore insoles.  These have great arch and heel support, and have already reduced the PF symptoms that used to flare by the end of a work day on my feet.  I like them so much, I just ordered two more pair."
5.0,I wear this item all the time. I can feel the difference right away. It does make the shoe a little tighter and higher so you will have to take your original sole out and put this in. But its a great insole.
5.0,"I couldn't find any relief with my Plantar fasciitis, I was able to walk again without any pain and it eventually healed wearing these. I have them in all my shoes!"
2.0,These are decent orthotics with adequate support/stiffness however these cane too narrow for my shoes. I can feel the edge if the insert against my big toe.  The insert should be a little wider.
5.0,"They are well worth the price, I don't walk too much typically but when I have to my feet don't hurt nearly as much as they did before I started using these."
5.0,"Comfortable/not hard surface. Felt the support at arch immediately. Wore in Sperry top sider shoes for a couple of hours and while I could feel that there were there, it did not in any way bother me. Next day I put them in Merrill hiking shoes for a walk, and I didn't even notice them. Have plantar fasciitis that comes and goes and was relieved that it didn't cause any discomfort during or afterwards.  They fit fine in running shoes (Brooks), hiking shoes as stated, Sperry boat shoes. They would not be suitable for high heels or dress shoes.  I think they are a great option for me for shoes that lack support, which I otherwise  could not wear. I have high arches and am wanting to wear Converse tennis shoes--we will see!"
3.0,"These insoles help my feet so much but this pair is already fraying around the edges.  Not sure why, but very frustrating!"
5.0,"I buy a pair of these with every new pair of running shoes. I have a job which requires me to spend hours at a time standing, and these work better than inserts costing a lot more."
4.0,Just as the doctor ordered for heel spurs and plantar fasciitis.
5.0,Always great!
5.0,I love these inserts. Glad to find them here for a little less :)
4.0,It help relief my arch and heel pain.  Before using this arch support I am in so much pain for standing and walking 10 hours working shift.  The pain is not completely go away yet but it did help.
5.0,"I suffer from flat feet and I bought this based on other reviews. It has good support all around and it is a true size, at least for me. I feel less pain on my feet while I stand for longer periods and I feel more stable to the ground. I use it nearly every day and the quality still remain in these soles. It took me 5 days to get used to them and after that you do not notice that you are wearing them at all."
5.0,great
5.0,They work as I expected them too. Have had before and they are the only ones that make the foot pain go away.
5.0,Great product. Cheaper on Amazon then in regular shoe store.
5.0,This is the only thing that saved me from surgery for my planters foot.
5.0,Works as well as the more expensive versions.
4.0,They are exactly what I need for my flat feet.
5.0,Very good product
5.0,I use these in my running shoes and they work really well.  I wear neutral cushioned running shoes and I have extremely high arches. These are the ONLY inserts that I've been able to find that work for me.  They provide good cushioning and the arch support I need.  Definitely recommend.
5.0,Comfortable fit. Size as expected.
5.0,Been using for 5 years.  I have them in every pair of shoes that I have.  gives my feet the support they need.  No more plantars faciitis. No problems to speak of.
5.0,Good for plantar fascitis
5.0,should have had them years ago .
5.0,This product has really helped the pain in my arches since being diagnosed with fallen arches! I have had no more pain ....I wear them in all my shoes!
5.0,great price!
4.0,Always love my Powersteps. Worn them for years. Received them very quickly.
5.0,Been using these for several years in work shoes and they are awesome
5.0,"Excellent, the best out there for arch support to help eliminate heel pain."
5.0,can't make it thru a day at work without these
5.0,This is my fourth pair. They really help make my shoes more comfortable.
5.0,I am on my feet all day. These are the only insoles that have ever worked for me.
5.0,Fit in shoe well.  Pain has decreased since I began using.
5.0,Works great for my plantar fasciitist. I won't wear shoes without these now. I will be buying more.
5.0,Great for my planter fasciitis.  Wear them all day in my dress shoes.
5.0,These helped my husband's foot pain very much.
5.0,Great support - these inserts elongate your arch.  They are very comfortable and support the entire foot.
5.0,"These insoles are great. They are so comfortable, I can work without all the pain. I will definitely buy these again."
5.0,These provide me with great arch support for not being a custom fitted orthotic insert. Use them when I'll be on my feet for long periods of time. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"Long lasting, I have a pair for all my shoes.
My podiatrist was thrilled that I had chosen this brand."
5.0,"Needed some support for my construction boots and these were great! I work asphalt and paving. On my feet all day, every day! These keep my feet from hurting and I love it!"
4.0,Great for plantar fasciitis. Love for tennis shoes and hiking shoes. Takes a couple days to break in but I cannot walk well without them.
5.0,"I put this in my Mizuno RX2 and RX3 shoes. I thought their sole wasn't that bad. They are top of the line volleyball shoes, as a Dick's store associate informed me. However, once I put these in I still noticed a big difference in the comfort of my feet, especially running and jumping. Now I don't wear the shoes without them!"
5.0,Very affordable option for replacements that offer a great deal of arch support.  I wear these often and they give good support and long wear comfort.
4.0,I thought the men's size would be too large because my size was out I was sent men's comparable size. But they were just like the women's size that I had previously ordered
5.0,These are great.  I have bought them for all my shoes.  They helped my plantar fasciatis instantly.  Great arch support.
5.0,"The pain from my plantar fasciitis disappeared when I put these in my size 10 shoes. I ordered another pair for another pair of shoes. The quality of the inserts looks excellent, and they're considerably less expensive than the high-quality label available at CVS. These were recommended to me by the podiatrist who diagnosed the pf. Very, very satisfied."
5.0,I have had several of these.  They help my planters facilities / arch problems.
5.0,great insole is you need arch support
5.0,Best cure for foot pain
5.0,I have been wearing this brand for years now and they are great! My podiatrist recommended them years ago and I have been wearing them since. Can not live without them.
5.0,I love these inserts.  Good support and cushion
5.0,"I have been wearing these a few weeks and I can't believe how well they have helped with my plantar fasciitis. I had bought several 'Dr. S' products, another similarly priced support that professed plantar help, but nothing worked until these. I was told by a podiatrist that I may need to wear them for six months or more before I am healed...regardless, what a relief!"
4.0,These are decent for the price.  The arch could be a bit higher for me but overall they do the trick.  I like how they absorb impact and that they fit the entire shoe.  No moving around under your foot and no need to pull your shoe off an readjust.throughout the day like those other supports.  I recommend them.
5.0,"These are wonderful. I had pretty severe plantar fasciitis. Couldn't even put weight on the foot at the start and spent 2+ months doing limping variations, despite putting my exercise program on hold, ice, and pain meds. I finally saw a podiatrist and he recommended Powerstep insoles. After doing daily stretches, wearing shoes whenever standing, and using these in all my shoes, I am all better. I was able to use the elliptical (with Powersteps in my Nikes) within 1-1.5 weeks of the treatment regimen, and I'm back to my full exercise program now. I can't recommend these enough. (I wear flip-flops without any insert while in the shower). Remember to remove the shoe's original insoles. These are intended to replace the original insoles."
5.0,I love these insoles!
5.0,"These supports are incredible for the price. As a Blackjack dealer, I'm on my feet all night and these keep my feet from hurting or feeling tired. I've used them for the past YEAR and I'm just now replacing them for 2016. I don't think I'll ever buy another insole as long as these are on the market. Way to go, Powerstep!!"
5.0,"I have been wearing the original Powerstep inserts for years and they've successfully managed my chronic plantar fasciitis. I recently went on a desperate search for the perfect everyday sneakers, and the best pair I found were woefully lacking in sole cushioning. I found the Pinnacle inserts online and figured it might compensate for the ""walking on plywood"" feeling. They did not disappoint. The moment I put weight on my feet it was like I was walking on a memory foam cloud used as a mattress by God himself. I am pleased."
1.0,"These inserts are WAY bigger than described! I ordered the ones for a women's shoe size of 7-7.5. My shoe size is 7, and it is impossible to fit these in my shoes because they are far larger than my shoes. In fact, the description indicates they should also fit a men's shoe of 5-5.5, but they fit perfectly in my husband's shoes - and his shoe size is a men's 10.5!"
5.0,These are better than my $300 pair from the foot doctor. Would buy again.
5.0,I was buying them from a shoe store for alot more money. These are good!
5.0,"Love these,  but not quite big enough to completely fill the toe area of my walking shoes.  Lots of cushion but I still need to wear my orthotics as the arch is not high enough"
2.0,too much depth to insole hope your shoes are too big
5.0,Great orthotic
5.0,2 pair I purchased works great
5.0,Perfect
5.0,these are now in my new winter boots UNDER the fur inserts. The boots were kind of cheap and these really help.
3.0,O.K.
3.0,The arches are too high for me.
4.0,"I purchased these orthotics at the recommendation of my podiatrist, who is treating me for plantar fasciitis.

These inserts work surprisingly well once you've gotten accustomed to having the extra support they provide. The package directions recommend using the inserts for a few hours to start, gradually progressing to all day wear. This is good advice. It's also advisable to remove any insoles in your shoes before putting in the orthotics.  Otherwise, the shoes are likely to be too tight in the instep.

I'm very pleased with the fact that my condition appears to be healing (pun intended) as a result of using the inserts in combination with shoes that don't flex excessively."
5.0,They work great.
5.0,Great for my Mountrail trail running shoes last two years.  I tried many others but these did the trick. However they are too much volume for some of my Nikes.  I would highly encourage you to try them. I have a high arch and somewhat high instep.
5.0,Very comfortable for all day support if you are on your feet all day.
5.0,I've purchased my second set of these. They have helped me get through 2 surgeries done to my feet and helped me to walk. I have had some made for me for $150 and they were horrible. These have changed my life for the better
5.0,"We love powerstep, highest arch support found in just the normal. You can get even higher support with the maxx. Best part is the arch is much better than superfeet, it includes more metatarsal. Super feet is more just an odd bump near the heel. I still use super feet for shoes with more support already included or need a lower profile."
5.0,My podiatrist recommended these inserts to alleviate foot pain -- they work great!  I'm on my feet 8-10 hours a day on a concrete floor and I can go home at the end of my shift and not be in pain.
5.0,These are the only thing that has helped my foot problems. The only problem is they only fit in one pair of shoes.
5.0,"Love these, I have bought multiple pairs."
5.0,"I have almost no arch and the factory made insoles in my running/work shoes (asiscs, brooks) do not provide enough arch support. If I do not switch out those insoles, my plantar fasciitis worsens. As a nurse, I am on my feet for 12-14 hours a day and cannot afford to be slowed down by aching arches. I have been using these insoles for 3 years and replace them every 6-8 months. Have delayed replacement longer than that with no ill effects."
4.0,good product
5.0,I have tried several insoles but my feet steal hiurt. I tried these insoles and they feel great! Would definitely recommend these insoles!
5.0,These inserts are the best thing going.  I started wearing them three years ago as a cure for plantar fasciitis.  They haven't disappointed and I'm on my third pair.  I'm on my feet a lot (8K-10K) steps a day with steel toe shoes so I have a lot to carry around.  I can tell when I wear other shoes that don't have these in them.  The rigid arch support can't be beat - but it takes a little bit of getting used to.  Now I can't go without them.  Highly recommended.
5.0,great
5.0,Miracle inserts! Recommended by my orthopedist and saved me from severe arch pain!
5.0,"More expensive than I'd prefer, but they're the only inserts I buy. I've had super flat feet all my life, but with these inserts I can walk for miles on city streets or over rough terrain with no discomfort.

I've owned several pairs, and the Men's 12-13.5 fit perfectly in every pair of size 13 shoes I own (once I remove any other inserts).

I have had a problem with wearing a hole in the foam with my right toe, which is the main reason I've had to replace them. I'm going to try a piece of duct tape on my new ones and see if that helps."
4.0,Stopped my Plantar pain almost immediately.
4.0,"Agree with other posters.. really good product but it does make shoes that come across the top of my foot a LOT tighter. I get around it making my toes squished by getting a size smaller than I would typically get. It still fits my foot and heel but it doesn't go to the end of my shoe, so the extra material from the insert does not make any significant difference for my toes' roominess."
5.0,"I've been wearing the powerstep brand for about ten years.  My podiatrist recommended I try these out before casting my feet and making expensive special supports.  These have been working great for me thus far, because I have little to no arch, heel pain, and sore knees.  I do a lot of walking and standing on my job and have to replace these supports every 3-4 months."
5.0,"this review is for powerstep pinnacle orthotics and superfeet insoles. I bought 2 of each, as my father and I need support. We used one of each for a week to see how they would fit. I was ready to send the superfeet back, cause the arches are to high for me and my father informed me he liked those better, so it was a win win. I recommend these for a person tat needs moderate support and the superfeet for those who need high arch support
I wear mine to work and i do a lot of walking 10hrs a day"
5.0,"So far so good. No foot pain, good support. Would have liked slightly more arch support, but gave 5 stars because they must be working if I don't have any pain after working on my feet all day."
5.0,must have if your on your feet all day
5.0,"Ordered these before, good quality, never disappointed!"
5.0,These inserts are a good value.
5.0,My Powerstep insoles have literally made my life better. They allow me to continue doing the sports I love without any pain. Who knew that overpronation was my problem? These insoles cannot be beat.
5.0,These are the best insoles I have had ever used.  They were recommended by my PT and I love them.  I have been using them for 2 plus years.
5.0,My husbands heel pain is greatly alleviated when he wears these!
4.0,"Too long, had to trim"
5.0,excellent
5.0,"These inserts are the most supportive and comfortable I have ever bought and used.  I wear top of the line athletic shoes, but the inserts that come with them are no where near as good as these."
4.0,Good and comfortable!
5.0,"If you need arch support in your shoes, this is a great solution if you don't want to spend the money on custom made."
5.0,Very comfortable.
5.0,"I bought a pair of these for every shoe I own. If my plantar fasciitis is acting up, my feet hurt while not wearing shoes, but stop hurting when I wear shoes with the inserts. I can't recommend these enough."
5.0,Always love these insoles.
5.0,I love these. They are in all of my shoes and they keep me pain free.
5.0,Offers good support for asics shoes.
4.0,"The top layer of fabric is peeling off, that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  Other than that, it's a great insole!"
5.0,"OMG, I love these inserts. I only need the right one, but it has helped tremendously with my planters fasciitis."
5.0,"Over time, these actually helped my plantar fasciitis. I don't even need to wear them all the time now."
5.0,I got fitted at a local running store.  They are great support and help my feet while running.
5.0,Very happy with fit & feel of theses shoe inserts.
5.0,"These orthotics were recommended by my podiatrist, specifically the blue ones. I have 2 pairs now, and I highly recommend them. I not only have plantar fasciitis, but also one flat foot, and one not. They did not cure my PF, but certainly helped with the pain. I work in a hospital, and am on my feet all day. These pinnacle inserts have made my feet a lot happier."
5.0,work perfectly
5.0,"This is my second pair for plantar fascitis, which I've had since February. They work better than Dr. Scholls, which I had tried first. I wear a size 5.5 to size 6 shoe, and these fit fine for my wide feet. My foot pain hasn't cured yet, but if I don't were these I really feel it."
1.0,"I wanted this to work so bad because of the pain in my feet, but they didn't do anything for me. I work on my feet all day and I wear steel toed shoes that don't have a comfortable foot bed. So I tried this product at an attempt to make my feet more comfortable and my friend recommended these. Unfortunately they worked for her, but they did not work for me. My feet would ache after using these, but I really wanted them to work and I tried them many many times to make sure that I fully gave them a chance. So I am still on the hunt for a comfortable insert, but this one was not for me."
3.0,Going to try another one
5.0,"As always, the best"
5.0,Great for chronic foot pain
1.0,didn'twork
5.0,"An excellent alternative to the MUCH more expensive custom orthotics for helping to reduce my foot and heal pain. Other people may have a different experience, but for me they work well."
5.0,These were recommended to me by a podiatrist and have been very helpful. No need for custom orthodics. Replace every 6 months.
5.0,These are great inserts.  I have bunions and pronate inward; these really help the problem.  They were delivered on time as expected.
4.0,"These are better than the Superfeet insoles I bought a few years ago that were supposed to help my feet. They were OK, but my problem with plantar fasciitis had progressed beyond their ability to help much. The Powerstep insoles haven't solved the problem, either, but they feel better."
5.0,Bought shoes that were a half size (maybe more) too big. These insoles solved that problem and offer amazing support
5.0,First pair lasted about 5 years and probably would have still been used but they were getting funky.  Really helped relieve my arch pain.  I would recommend them to anybody that has arch pain.
4.0,"Working well, buying more."
5.0,"I get frustrated with arch support products, and I've finally found my go-to with this product. I've purchased it many times over with each new pair of shoes I've purchased. I use them in everything from my Doc Martens to my running shoes. I will continue to use these until God gives me less aggravating feet."
4.0,"I purchased this Powerstep Pinnacle for a dress shoe, but the shoe became too shallow.  The heel of the insole has to much cushion so it brought my heel up too high.  I will use this insole in my athletic shoe.  Be very careful when ordering for dress shoes.  This insert has a firm arch support and the rest of the area is flexible.  Good for high-heels and probably one size larger in your shoe size.  I have ordered the Powerstep Original for my athletic shoes and hopefully this will work for my platform dress shoe.  The Powerstep Original is not flexible, but at the same time it is not quite rigid.

The descriptions for all Powerstep shoe inserts should be more clearly stated.  This Pinnacle insert did not state that it would affect the depth of the shoe."
5.0,These are a great choice if you cannot afford orthotics. They give a good support of arch.
5.0,"Saw online reference to these from a podiatrist, thought I'd try them. Absolutely AMAZING!
I have NO arch, very flat feet...and these are extremely comfortable. I'll be getting more pairs for other shoes now, and I might try the version with a little higher arch , although these are so very comfortable that I may just stick with them.
I've had prescription orthotics before, and these are high quality for the price. And you can obviously change them more often, if you're using in athletic shoes and they get smelly."
5.0,I have these in all my shoes.  no more heal problems
1.0,"I bought these for Planter Fasciitis in my right heel and for some arch support.  They really didn't do much to help these issues.  Also, they are too thick to wear in most shoes unless you remove the original sole from the shoe you want to wear.  I only used them a few times and don't bother with them anymore."
5.0,just as described
5.0,These are the only insoles that last for years and truly prevent heel pain and provide lasting arch support.  I recommend them to my family!
5.0,These were recommended by my doctor and have helped tremendously. I have purchased 4 pair so I don't have to change them in and out of different pair of shoes.
5.0,They work well for my plantar fasciitis.
5.0,my wife Plantar Facilities was helped with this insole
5.0,"Easily trimmable to fit, very comfortable, excellent value"
4.0,Best nonprescription option that I have found.
5.0,"Been buying these for years, love them!"
5.0,Met all my expectations.
4.0,"I have plantar fasciitis and wanted to try commercial orthotics before shelling out for custom ones. These work really well. The problem is, they only fit in my casual gym shoes. They're too wide in the heel for my flats or even boots, even if I remove the original insoles. And the heel cannot really be trimmed to fit. So that is frustrating, I'm going to have to buy new shoes for these to work."
5.0,"i have been wearing the go walk 3 shoes to work, i am on my feet all day. the doctor says i have bone spurs or plantar fascistic,  i have been wearing this pair of shoes now for about a week with the insoles and my heals are feeling better.  i got my fist set of these a while back and for some reason i was not wearing them in my shoes,  decided to try them again and i am glad i did.

since they seem to be working so well i jut got two more pairs to put in my newbalance 608 v3,  and my brooks ravena 6  shoes,  hopefully they will work as well in those shoes ad the sketchers.  the sketchers are super cushy when you step down.  more cushy than any shoe i have ever worn..  they do not feel as cushy with these in there but its definitely helping my heels feel better so far."
2.0,"Not quite what I had in mind as the Aetrex Lynco inserts are the best.  (I just ordered a pair to replace these inserts)  I did not listen to the comments from everyone as the arches are very high and there's not much cushioning with these inserts as they are very firm.  If you like cushioning & have flat feet, don't buy these inserts!"
5.0,"Great, I've been using these for years"
5.0,"great for plantar fasciitis, heel spur."
5.0,"I rely on these, put them in all my boots and shoes that have room for them."
5.0,"These are a footsaver!  I walk on concrete in tennis shoes all day.  These immediately relieved all foot/leg pain associated with that.  They make an expensive addition to a good pair of shoes, but I have found I can generally get 2 pairs' worth of shoes use from these.  They're $15 less expensive from Amazon then from the podiatrist :-)  My doctor claims these are the best inserts you can buy without doing a prescription orthotic insert.  I have both, and these are nearly as good at much less of a price!"
2.0,"I would rate these at 2.5 stars, They fit good and didn't even take much trimming - I was very surprised how ""plug and play"" they were.

I have two identical pairs of Danner work boots that I alternate daily, and both had completely worn out insoles.  I decided to do a comparison between brands, and after scouring amazon via the user ratings and visiting product websites -  I decided on a set of Super Feet ""Green"" insoles and a pair of Powerstep ""pinnacle"" insoles.  It has been over a week of use now (10-12 hrs a day with boots on), and I can say that I am substantially happier with the super feet green insoles.  The thing I notice is that the pinnacles have substantial arch support - I would venture to say too much for me, as soon as I put on my boots I can tell the difference from my other pair.  While they seem to be of good quality, and are made in the USA - when my feet feel like tenderized hamburger at the end of the day, I can't continue using them.  I'm sure these are a great insole, especially if you need the support - they just didn't work for me."
5.0,"I've been wearing this since I bought them afraid of the fiber plastic might get flatten or loose its form, I am 235 lb and this guys still the same, helping with my plantar faciatis and foot pain."
5.0,"Good service, will buy again"
4.0,Like it
1.0,These didn't fit properly so I couldn't use them.
4.0,I have pain in my feet all day every day and these have very much helped. I am thinking about buying another pair to have for other shoes. Highly recommended
5.0,Fantastic footsoles and great support. Will definately buy more from this vendor as they got here quickly and I use them in my tennis shoes for extra support.
4.0,"I really enjoy walking and hiking but suffer from extremely weak arches, arthritis in both first metatarsals, and sciatica. Good arch support is essential for a proper stride and to distribute my foot properly. These inserts seem to remedy the first two problems, and help with the third. They are quite firm, and I wouldn't mind a bit softer feel, but the overall support is excellent. I haven't used them for long, and I'll see if they bump up to five stars in a future review."
5.0,great insoles for the price. last forever
4.0,Podiatrist recommend this for arches that are beginning to fall!  Another nice thing about these inserts are that you can trim them to fit your shoe perfectly
2.0,"Not very comfortable, but it could be because the arch is so high. Guess there must be a way to figure out which is right for you. Birkis sandals are the only things that help my plantar fascitis."
5.0,It has been several months but I can wholeheartedly recommend these for foot support. Completely eliminated my tendonitis pain.
5.0,Love them
5.0,Followed other reviews and broke them in gradually...am up to 6-8 hours a day and my heel feels better than it has in months!
5.0,Took away the pain
5.0,These offer great arch support. Will buy again
4.0,Relieves foot pain but can't wear in most shoes because of height of insoles
3.0,These have good arch support but not enough cushion in the heel so they did not help me at all. I have plantar fasciitis with a lot of heel pain.
5.0,most comtable inserts out there. Fits any shoe and helps tired feet all day
3.0,Still think over priced.
5.0,"Fast ship,great item, thanks!"
5.0,These really help my plantar fasciitis - wish they cost less.
5.0,Very comfy!
5.0,Super comfortable I'm on my feet for 12+ hours at work and these help my flat feet. I will buy again when they wear out
5.0,"WOW! I suffer from plantar fasciitis.  Mostly it flares up when I am wearing dress shoes that don't give much support.  I have been looking for an affordable insole to help me with this.  Well, I can tell you I found it.  I have a pair of very nice ecco slip-ons I wear everday for work, and after about 6 months, the insole wore down and I began to get pain in my arch and forefoot.  I found these, they had good reviews for the most part, so I took a shot.  First off, they made my feet feel better as soon as I put them in my ecco's and tried them on.  After a day, my foot pain has subsided and I feel great.  I don't know if these are something for athletics (running, working out, etc.) but I do know that if you suffer from pain in a dress shoe, these get my 100% support, as I am amazed at how great they feel and how quickly my pain went away.  I am going to ensure I stick with these from now on, $35 is way better than buying a new pair of ecco's at $200.00, especially when they still essentially look new and can be polished up as needed.  Very happy!!!"
5.0,Great Price - Fast Delivery!!
5.0,Use these in all my shoes
5.0,"Seller is great! Excellent customer service and I plan on purchasing from again.
The product is great and it has really helped my son with his ankle issues. This is a great alternative to custom orthotics especially for kids who are still growing. Highly recommend."
5.0,Good price and good product
5.0,Daughter was complaining of arch pains.  One daughter got 400 orthotics.  The other got these and they both work and look identical.  But one tenth the price. 100% going wi th these next time for me and my kids
5.0,Very good arch support!
5.0,"Don't know how my husband functioned before without these. Real support and fit inside shoes that can have the insert removed that was inserted when manufactured. Durable and can be cleaned, wear good, he had had them over a year, He has fallen arches and this really gives the support needed. Great price compared to shoe stores."
5.0,"These have helped with pain and were recommended by my Doctor several years back, I have them in most all of my Shoes now.  On line is the best way to purchase as Retail they are sometimes twice the price."
5.0,Very comfortable. Fit shoe perfectly.
4.0,"They did fine, better than the 3/4 length."
5.0,I was initially prescribed these by a Podiatrist when I had foot pain.  They resolved the pain and are now in all of my shoes.  They last a long time too.  When I buy a new pair of shoes the first thing I do is pull out the original insoles and pop these in.
5.0,Best support for your feet. love them
5.0,"These are the most awesome inserts for Plantar fasciitis.  My feet ache after being on them for an hour or more, and I kick off my shoes whenever I sit down.  (Thank goodness for a desk that I can hide my feet behind!)  However, I shopped around for a great insert and this shoe insert by Powerstep Pinnacle lives up to its reputation for relieving a variety of foot problems.  It has great cushioning for the entire foot--especially the heels, and good arch support.  My feet have never been so happy--not in a long, long time!

I will be a repeat buyer!

5.0,Great product
4.0,GREAT JOB.  EXACTLY WHAT I wanted.  Thanks!!!
5.0,Works great!
2.0,These were only as good as the previous insoles that came with my shoes. The bottoms are almost as solid as rocks; they had left my feet even more sore than before.
4.0,Perfect fit.
5.0,These definitely helped support my arches and relieve the pain associated with my plantar fasciitis.
4.0,"These were suggested by my podiatrist. I have a hard time guessing why they are the cats pajammas when you compare them to the multitude of insoles on the market. I wish they were less expensive. However, I did notice a vast improvement in my foot pains. I did NOT have any improvement in other pains that my podiatrist thought they might help. I don't think I'll want to continue spending this much when my Dr. can make me some that will be covered by insurance. I just wonder if they are really that much different than others out there? But as I said, at least they helped with foot pain."
5.0,Great product. I have been using it for years for my plantar fasciitis.
4.0,"Good insoles, for light weigh people, if you are over 230 pounds won't help for more than 2 months with every day use."
4.0,They are just fine.
5.0,"This is the second pair of these insesrts I have purchased.  I love that they come in specific lenghths, because the ones that have to be trimmed never fit right"
5.0,This is a wonderful product.  My husband and I both use them.
3.0,"I have been using Powerstep Pinnacles for at least 10 years.  But this last pair only lasted 3 months of daily use (walking only, no running) before I wore a hole in the padding at the big toe!  Either the quality is dropping or I'm walking differently.  Either way, these are ridiculously expensive for the materials and labor involved in making them.  I'd guess less than a dollar to manufacture.  I have looked hard for an alternative but have found none!  This is curious because our capitalist system virtually guarantees competition.  Maybe there is patent protection?  If so, on what?  Anyway, I WAS happy enough in the past when they would last 6 months or more."
4.0,"My custom inserts were getting pretty expensive to replace. A local orthopedist recommended these. So far, pretty good. Not quite as good as custom inserts, but they are good for basic support. I will have to try their other models to see if they have different fits."
3.0,"This highly suggested (by my orthopod) expensive product is no better than any higher priced insole available over the counter. I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it."
5.0,Foot pain began to subside immediately.
5.0,great product
5.0,"Had them for a while now to really test them, and I love them. They worked in my Brooks Ghost sneakers for both running and bugging about town.  My feet can tell the difference too!"
5.0,These insoles are supportive and a great value.  The arh support is strong and comfortable.
5.0,Great durable insert
5.0,Converts any shoe into the best supportive shoe.
5.0,FIT GREAT REALLY GIVE SUPERIOR SUPPORT FOR FLAT FEET
5.0,I have used the Powerstep insoles for quite a few years now and am pleased with the support they give.
5.0,I love the inserts wear them in any pair of shoes . make my feet feel good all day. no pain.
4.0,Long lasting and comfortable.
5.0,I have planter fasciitis and these insoles made a world of difference. I tried them out at a chucks boots store and now I have been using them for about a year now. I just ordered 2 more set for future shoes. I am very happy I found an insole that works well. The full length is a nice feature that most insoles don't have when it comes to good arch support. When you have slip on dress shoes the non full length style is always annoying. These stay put and offer great support that seems to last.
5.0,"Power step Pinnacle insoles are the best. I have used them for several years because they are comfortable, give good support and hold up very well."
4.0,"These orthotics work pretty well but don't relieve the pain completely. I will probably by another pair, so I don't have to keep switching them from one pair of shoes to another."
4.0,"These have a bit more cushion in the arch than the original, that's all the difference I can detect."
5.0,"These insoles are awesome!  I have always loved Superfeet, but decided to give these a try.  I will keep buying these...a bit less expensive and at least as good, if not better.  I enjoy the slightly softer cushioning of these, but they are still firm enough to support."
5.0,These insoles in combination with a good shoe will make your feet feel great all day long.
5.0,"Good product that make your feet feel better.
Fast shipping"
5.0,great support
5.0,"I have used these for about 4 years now and would not be without them... great for my work shoes!, no more planter fasciitis and a great price"
5.0,One of my workout essentials. I have high arches and weak ankles. I use these in my running shoes and rarely ever have problems with my knees and ankles.
4.0,I've noticed only a slight difference in support with this model of Powerstep insole. My left foot still curves inwards a bit more than I like though.
5.0,Great product!
5.0,Love. Going to order more.
5.0,Very happy
5.0,they work
5.0,"Tried lots of other insoles, but none offered the same cushioning and support for this price. Bought another pair for my dress shoes."
5.0,These are the same supports I've received from my foot doctor. They feel great and really help the pain from plantar facitis.  They work great in tennis shoes and casual full coverage shoes. They aren't made for sandals.  The last pair I had lasted over a year.
5.0,After months of heel discomfort (I assume it was plantar fasciitis)  someone suggested I try these insoles.  After just 2 days of wearing them the pain was 95% gone.  I put them in my running shoes and don't have any discomfort at all.  Now I use them in every pair of shoes that touches my feet.  I had tried about 6 other inserts and these are the only ones that helped.
5.0,Good product. Real help my flat feet feel better
4.0,"Recommended by a friend to combat plantar fasciitis pain. Have been very pleased with how they feel.
Make sure to order the correct size (if you are MALE or FEMALE). I ordered my size (given no option on GENDER) and received a FEMALE size, which is a shade short in my shoes."
5.0,Love it
5.0,WOW these are just great. I have tried so many solutions for flat feet and these are just wonderful
5.0,The best
5.0,"Painful at first, but after a full day these feel pretty good. I typically buy Sole inserts, but they can get expensive if you buy them for every pair of shoes you have. I got these simple to test and they did quite well."
5.0,Arrived on time as described and at a great price
4.0,"GREAT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN!!!"
5.0,Feet quit hurting
4.0,"Works well. Used these in hiking boots back-packing - so a good test as was carrying weight.  Think these have been well-researched and designed.
The cost is not justified, however. These should be cheaper. If they were, the co. would warrant more respect. and also make more money."
5.0,These are the best we have found to keep our feet happy and free from plantar fasciitis.
5.0,Works Great
4.0,I'd definitely return for more. Thanks again for your help.
4.0,"This is a very good alternative to custom-made orthotics. I bought these on the recommendation of my podiatrist when I asked about having a new pair of orthotics made that were more flexible than the semi-rigid custom pair that I have worn for 10+ years. I am a runner, and the custom pair that I have are not quite flexible enough to allow my foot full range of motion. The Powerstep insoles are the perfect solution to my problem. They are covered with a plush foam material that over time conform to the shape of your foot, thus making the built-in arch support essentially the same as a custom-made insole but for a fraction of the price. At first, the left insole felt like the arch support section was a little too high--I could feel it pressing into my arch instead of supporting it--but after about two weeks of daily wear the foam covering had compressed enough that it no longer felt weird. It was never painful, just slightly weird feeling (this is likely due to the shape of my own feet and not something everyone will experience).

The only cons I can think of are that these tend to be a bit wide, so per the instructions I had to use a pair of scissors to trim the foam covering to where it properly fit in my shoes without having to fight to get them in there. They also seem to wear out quicker than custom insoles, so you will probably have to replace these about once a year, possibly more if these get heavy wear. If you're a runner, I recommend getting one pair for your running shoes and a second pair for your everyday work/leisure shoes."
5.0,"Love, love, love these!! Will not jog without them, even with my high end running shoes.  These are great and help with my knee and foot pain!!"
5.0,Great
3.0,"I buy a or every month, no more pain, when u wear these!"
5.0,These are perfect - my plantar fasciitis is going away and my feet don't hurt the way they used to.
1.0,Not comfortable. Not at all.
5.0,"I originally purchased these at my podiatrist and they were over priced and I was sceptical.  My doctor recommended them because I was recovering from a stress fracture in my foot.  So I gave them a try and I will never go without them ever again!!!!!  I highly recommend them, especially if you work on your feet like I do.."
5.0,"I suffered from severe plantar faciaitis that would not go away.  A physical therapist recommended this particular arch support.  As he promised, in a couple of weeks, the pain was much less severe and finally after a couple of months the pain was gone.  I replaced the factory insoles in my shoes with these. With daily wear they last a little over a year before the heel portion starts to break down.  But if you have heel pain or plantar faciaitis pain, I highly recommend you replace the insoles in your daily shoes with these arch supports.  For $35 a pair or so, it's money well spent.  Especially when you compare to the price of some of the arch supports in the specialty stores that go as high as $500 a pair."
4.0,Effective and good fit for someone with big feet.  More aggressive arch than other insoles I've tried and they work better relieving my plantar fasciatis.
5.0,best support was recomended by my foot doctor
5.0,Great deal and shipped quickly and they are perfect for my tennis shoes
4.0,"Excellent arch support. Arch is semi-rigid, so it does what it's supposed to. I only wish that the sizes weren't combined (fits 8 - 8.5). I wear an 8 and I have to work a little to get them in my shoes and the fit is snug. The solution would be to trim them, but they don't seem to be designed that way, so I don't want them to start coming apart or unraveling at the toe. Otherwise, great insert."
4.0,Fit nice and seem to be helpful.
5.0,These hold up well and are worth the money. Comfortable and easy to clean.
4.0,They provide enough support for my fee.  I like them.
5.0,Ordered these for me and loved them.  Then ordered some for my husband
5.0,Comfortable insole for inside tennis shoes.  Forget podiatrists.
5.0,"Best inserts ever.  Good arch support, and cushioning that lasts.  Way better than Superfeet."
5.0,Great inserts.  50+ running with these bad boys and they provide the right amount of support and comfort for my flintstone feet
5.0,I had the basic power steps before but these are nicer.  Good support for the arch.  Comfortable
5.0,Its good
4.0,Does the job for me
5.0,Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles give great arch support have been using them for 2 years now . I use them in each set of boots and shoes I wear. They relieved the pain in my heel and help with my knee pain also.
2.0,"I have high arches and even though these insoles have very good arch support, they have very little padding in the heel and ball of the foot. I tried them inside my Red Wing 606 work boots and i felt like the stock insoles that came with the boots were more comfortable even though they lack the type of arch support i should probably be using. I would check out a company called Sole which makes insoles for Red Wing under the Red Wing name. I haven't tried them but I have felt their insoles in the store and they seem to be a little more padded in the heel and ball areas while offering good arch support. YMMV."
4.0,Best shoe insert I have tried. Not a gel insert but gives excellent support for me.
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,This is about my 10th pair  I wear them everyday & change them for new twice a year
5.0,"Wow, game changer. Great price and way more comfortable than my orthotic."
5.0,These are the best orthotics you can buy. I have some from the Dr. That are not as comfortable. These are a great price and excellent product.
5.0,"I wear these in my gym shoes that I wear nearly everyday.  I have tries 5 or 6 different brands and I think these are my favorite.  Something about the pad in the middle of the foot just feels good when I walk.  I do not use these in sports, but I may consider giving them a try."
5.0,My husband has lots of foot problems and these have been a lifesaver.
5.0,These are the best things ever. They help you balance and takes some of the pain rom running. I have been using these for many years and they are expensive but worth it.
5.0,"I rate the effectiveness of support insoles by how long and far I can walk before my feet tire out.  I have used orthotics made by two podiatrists, Good Feet, Dr. Scholl's Custom Fit, and several other brands.  Powerstep is clearly the best."
5.0,I do not have a pair of shoes without powerstep insoles.  Wouldn't think of it!!!!
5.0,Love them. Pain is gone.
5.0,I have bought several pairs of these orthotics and use them in all of my athletic shoes. My Podiatrist told me to buy them a few years ago. I have plantar faciitis. Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics provide excellent support. Two years ago I bought a pair of New Balance walking shoes and also bought a New Balance Orthotic insert. After a few days my feet were aching. I bought another pair of Powerstep Pinnacle inserts and the aching stopped.
5.0,I suffer from plantar fasciitis for 4 years. I've bought many different inserts and orthotics searching for relief. My new podiatrist recommended these and they are fantastic!!! I love them. The seller that I bought them from had free delivery. The price was excellent and shipping was fast.
5.0,Long lasting wear. For people who need arch supports. I have them in every shoe I own.
5.0,"Been using  these  for arch support.  Helps me better  than  the expensive  ""custom orthotics"". As expected the will breakdown  overtime  so keep  an eye on them  if your alignment is affected by this. Much better to buy here than pay $40 @ Newport Balance  store."
4.0,Fits shoe perfectly
5.0,Relieves arch and knee pain immediately.  I wear mine every day.
5.0,I have purchased the Powerstep in the past and it works really well to relieve foot pain while working or standing for a long time
5.0,Second time ordering this item. Supports the heel well and arch is not too high as some are. Stands up to heavy use & easily transfers to shoes.
5.0,Size is right on and they make long days on your feet much better.
5.0,Great product.  My orthopedic was selling the same ones but for little more expensive. It's the same and works great. I'm planning on getting another pair. They are  very comfortable in my running shoes.
3.0,"This is a very good quality product, don't get me wrong. It just doesn't work for me. I do want arch support but I feel like the *outside* edge of my foot, opposite the arch, is being pushed up as well. There is also very little extra cushioning in the heel, which is hard to tell from the photo."
4.0,"I bought these inserts because of all the reviews written by other plantar fascitis sufferers.  They have certainly helped, but I can't wear sneakers to work, so my PF isn't completely gone.  However, these inserts have definitely helped my condition."
2.0,I severely overpronate.  I am a Phys. Ed. teacher and Summer Camp director so I am on my feet quite often.  These worked well for about a week and then the pain in my hip and knees returned.  I put the Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx back in my shoe that I had worn for about 2 months prior and a day or so later and the pain was gone again.
5.0,"I've used these (this is my third pair) for probably 8 years now.  I've found them to be as supportive (and more cushioned) than my custom orthotics.  I have plantar fasciitis, but no pain with these.  Great product!"
5.0,great shoes
5.0,These insoles provide great support and fit in any shoe. I purchased insoles for each shoe.
5.0,Great
4.0,"I am continuing to do dance aerobics while trying to recover from plantar fasciitis.  These inserts make it possible to dance for about 45 minutes with minimal discomfort.  I would have rated them higher, but my feet do hurt afterward...sometimes quite a bit."
5.0,IT is excellent product and it support my foot very well
5.0,What a relief the inserts brought to my feet.
4.0,Product is as advertised and in like quality as others I used previously.  Shipping was on time.  I would buy again.
5.0,"Can't beat these Powerstep insoles.  I can tell if the shoe I am wearing does not have Powersteps, because my back starts hurting.  That's why every pair of shoes I own will have these in them."
2.0,"Really thin base...too soft to provide support for my flat feet....guess when you try cheap, that is what you get!!!"
5.0,I've bought four or five of these....can't wear athletic shoes without them...great support
5.0,Best insoles I have ever used and I have tried many.  Has virtually solved my foot problems and made okay shoes/hiking boots into excellent shoes/boots.
5.0,Fit was perfect and gives excellent arch support. No more sore feet.
5.0,Great for walking
5.0,These are great.
5.0,"Use these in my old Nike athletic shoes on top of the original insole to mow the lawn. Before I put these in my heel was killing me the next morning after mowing. Now no more pain the next day.  Coupled with my compression sock at night my heel pain is gone in three months. And I'm 63 years old, how about that!"
5.0,I love these insoles! I have very high arches and the save my feet! The only problem is that my asics are a women's 9.5 and I had to buy a size E for women's size 10-10.5 for these to fit in my shoes. The size D were about a cm or two too short. Very uncomfortable. So just be sure to get the proper size. I have 3 pairs of these now and put them in all of my shoes that I have to stand/walk in a lot!
5.0,Awesome !
4.0,"And I felt good, it very stable, I recommend use"
5.0,The product was shipped on time and delivered as state.
5.0,"I have a high arch and moderate pronation.  I suffered plantar fasciitis after wearing flat sandals and the orthopedic MD ordered expensive orthotics that did not help.  I purchased these from a New Balance store after a fitting and these are great.

I use them instead of the insoles that come with my tennis shoes.  I am a nurse and on my feet sometimes for over 12 hours.  I also exercise and walk.  These orthotics are the best."
5.0,"has helped me greatly, great product"
5.0,"I first purchased these insoles from my podiatrist and paid a lot more for them! I use these in my sneakers and running shoes and I immediately noticed a huge difference. When you first start wearing them they make your arch feel unnaturally high, but even on my first run I noticed that my foot pain was gone. They lasted for about a year before I felt like it was time for a new pair. Due to the hard sole, they can't really be worn in flats, but fit great in sneakers. I like that they are well padded around the ball of your foot since that is where I have issues."
5.0,"my hubby is on his feet all day and we have tried different boots, dr scholars $60 inserts and it seems to not last long at all. He tried this on a whim and won't ever go back to anything else EVER. He is hooked on these and tells everyone about them. Will be buying these for many more years to come"
5.0,Using these for years in my tennis shoes. Great!!
5.0,They  really help my heal problem
5.0,Quality product with excellent support. Delivered as promised and on time.
1.0,"These insoles provide little to no support. I have custom made orthotics but needed ones that are a little more flexible for certain shoes. These got such great reviews so I figured it was a no brainer. As soon as you put weight on the insole in collapses and flattens - no support for your arch. I weigh 115 so it's not like it's due to my weight. Also, I've been battling a very stubborn knee problem and now some feet problems, hence the reason I'm wearing orthotics. If you are looking for something to put your foot ankle and knee into alignment and you have high arches, these are not for you.

Needless to say, I reached out to the seller (Surgical Medical Source) for advice on possibly purchasing another pair that would work better for my foot and they were zero help, not friendly and dismissive. Zero stars for customer service. I will never purchase from them again."
5.0,so far so good.  just loving it.  it gives enough support on my heel which was a problem for me.
5.0,"A few years ago I went to podiatrist for and extreme pain in the heel of my foot. He diagnosed me with planters fasciitis(I was beginning to develop a bone spur) and he prescribed this very model insole. I much preferred this than a Cortisone shot (which would only temporarily where remove the pain, but not the problem. I've been wearing them consistently in all my footwear, stretching my calf muscles daily, and have yet to have had a recurrence I'll any pain whatsoever. (the pain went away within two weeks of wearing insoles add practicing the stretching exercises.) I'm extremely satisfied with this product."
2.0,"Destroyed my foot, 2 stars"
4.0,I used this product once before with very good results.
4.0,"i feel great with the insole.  only problem is that my shoe size is 9 1/2  or 10.  maybe you can advise what i can do.  i certainly will by another.  i hate to keep changing them to other shoes.

s friend told me about them.  very sasified"
5.0,I have several of these.  They work as well as the expensive orthotic my podiatrist once made for me.
5.0,"These were recommended by my orthopedic doctor when I had plantar fasciitis. They're great! I have several pairs now, and they've held up very well. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Fit fine, with no trimming or adjustment in my size 11 to 11 1/2 shoes.  Very good buy!  No pain at all from planter fasciitis while wearing, and it seems to be slowly going away."
4.0,"It fill comfortable in my sneakers,but I could not put them in my woman shoes because they not fit it ( bigger)"
1.0,what the dr orderedwrong size
5.0,Great soles
5.0,I've been wearing these insoles for years with my some of my walking shoes.  Just needed some new ones!
5.0,Great
5.0,"Great Product!!  My feet don't hurt when I use them in my shoes. My foot doctor told me to try them. I always put them in my walking shoes.
Very reasonably priced and they arrived quickly"
4.0,Purchased for my daughter to use in her converse shoes to provide support. She has worn these for a weekend and so far she is pleased with them. If her degree of comfort changes over the next month or two then I will submit an updated review.
5.0,"Powerstep put the step back in my feet! I suffered from PAINFUL plantar fasciitis. Many mornings I had to crawl to the bathroom because of the heal pain! I wore these in a nice supportive running shoe for about a year (changing them when needed) now have no pain!  I can wear my cute shoes again!!! If you have foot pain.... GET THESE!!! You do have to be faithful to wear them, though!"
4.0,"I really wanted to write an in depth helpful review so that I could actually try and help people find some relief for their foot, back, and knee pain that they might be experiencing like I do. Before I start, let me say that from my research and testing of many different OTC orthotic insoles and arch supports I do not think they are all bad or all good. I think they have to be matched to the type of foot you have. Having said that, it can be frustrating to continuously spend money on insoles that offer no help. I have not tried everything on the market, but I have tried many and here are the results that have helped me.
  First, I have a size 10 foot that is wide. My foot actually measures 9.5 and E in width on a brannock device but through experience I always buy a 10 2E running shoe. Even then certain styles might be a bit snug in the width for me. I am 5'11"" and weigh 194. So over the years from gaining weight, being on my feet all day in the medical field, and being pretty active, my arches have fallen. Until I found out they had fallen, I never understood why after being on my feet all day the pain in my feet, ankles, and knees, was downright terrible. Then I started trying the different inserts and some helped but most were a waste of money. You can research on the net how fallen arches contribute to this pain.
  For my condition, I tend to need a higher arch support that will not collapse when running and staying on my feet all day. So began my search.
For my type of condition, the two best products that have worked for me are the blue colored powerstep pinnacle and the Dr. Scholls # 430 insert sold on the foot mapping machines at walmart. I do realize that these are not custom inserts, but I am trying to avoid the expensive orthopedist route as long as I can.
  So the powerstep pinnacle has the right amount of the medium to high arch support that I require. I can feel the lump under my arch as some have complained about, but this seems to be exactly what I need to feel relatively pain free after being on my feet all day or running my miles each evening. These do take a day or so to get used to, but they have helped me very well for the most part. Do I feel like I'm 18 and problem free again....no, but its the best I've felt yet short of spending a fortune and going the custom route. I have worn these insoles two ways. On shoes that run big I have placed them on top of the factory insole which gave just a little extra cushion and I have also removed the factory insole and used just the powerstep insole by itself. These are strictly running shoes that I have tested these in, but I have no doubt they would work in boots as well. I do not think they would fit in dress shoes. As a side note I also tried the maroon colored pinnacle max but the wedge on the bottom of the orthotic over compensated too much for my level of pronation and it was uncomfortable for me. I use the blue inserts in a stability type running shoe and this has been the best combination for me.
  The other insert that worked well for me was the 430 Dr. Scholls on top of the factory insole as these are 3/4 length.
So for my type of foot, I have tried the green super feet which did not offer enough arch support but were very comfortable for someone who may require less support. The pinnacle maxx were great except for that square plate underneath which over corrected my pronation and was uncomfortable. I tried the Dr. Scholls arch pain relief which were terrible compared to the other 430's. They did not fit well in any shoe and the arch support while high, did not ever seem to fall in the right position for my foot. I tried the envelop 3/4 orthotics and these did not work well either. They too just never fit in the shoe right or felt natural. I tried the VIVEsole 3/4 length and these felt like they had no arch support at all and were so narrow they kept shifting around in the shoe.
  I am still waiting to receive some spenco's and some prolab p3 semi customs to try and see how they do.
I will rate the pinnacles at a 4 because they feel about as good as my #430 Dr. Scholls and they do help a lot, but I'm sure compared to a custom they can only do so much. They were by far the best OTC I have come across in my testing so far. So if you need the higher support from fallen arches like I do, these may help you. Remember, you will feel the highness under your arch which you get used to. and you should wear them intermittently the first few days to adapt to them. Don't be afraid to try them with or without the factory insole left in place.

********update********* I now had a chance to compare the blue pinnacles against my expensive semi-custom prolab p3 orthotics and I am sending the P3's back. It's not that they were bad, they just were not as comfortable as the blue pinnacle orthotics and the pinnacles are 1/3 the price!!!! I am considering changing this review to 5 stars because of how pleased I am with the pinnacles compared to all of the other orthotics I am slowly trying. I do still think they might be a bit tough for constant running compared to the #430's because the 430's have so much cushion."
5.0,Recommended by the foot Dr and after using them I see why.  Great for my all my foot issues.
5.0,I cannot own a pair of tennis shoes without these.  Great for high arches.
5.0,"I have been wearing this brand of insole for years.  This summer I've been wearing shoes that aren't suitable for these inserts, and even though the shoes are very comfortable, they are no match for wearing shoes with these insoles.  In fact, after a few weeks of being on my feet at work I was in so much pain I knew I needed to drop everything and order a new pair of Powersteps.  As happened the first time I ever used them about 8 years ago, my spine and body felt incredibly relieved after my first walk on a fresh pair of Powersteps.  I've tried many products and I only use powerstep insoles now.  I'm resolved when looking for new shoes in the future that I won't buy any that can't accommodate these insoles."
5.0,Life savers... okay REALLY help with plantar faciitis! I double with Dr. Scholl's Tri-Comfort Orthotics Inserts under these... when worn regularly pain is eliminated! Seriously!
5.0,I loved these so much I bought a second pair. They do wonders for the pain I have from a heal spur.
5.0,good price
4.0,Helps to cushion my foot with a Morton's neuroma during tennis play.  They were recommended by my Orthopedist's PA who I saw for my foot ailment.
5.0,"I have 4 pairs of custom orthotics that I use in all my shoes.  Because I have more pairs of shoes than orthotics, I'm constantly swapping out the orthotics.  To get around that I decided to try out the Power Pinnacle Orthotics and have been very pleased with how well they perform compared to custom orthotics.  After a month of use, I have the same comfort with the Power Pinnacle Orthotics as with the custom orthotics.  These have performed much better than other brands of off-the-shelf preconfigured orthotics that I've purchased and are a much more economical alternative to custom orthotics."
5.0,"Really fit my womens 8 foot perfectly.  I added them to a pair of slippers and a pair of flat shoes, for arch support and cushioning.  I really like them WAAAAY better than my 500 dollar orthotics from the doctor.  If only I had known......"
3.0,"I have been wearing the insert for about three weeks.  It is quite comfortable to wear, but my planter fasciitis has not improved any."
5.0,Love these!
2.0,Uncomfortable! They dig in the inner part of you foot! Had to take them out and throw them away!
5.0,perfect
5.0,made a world of difference for me.
5.0,Can't wear my shoes without these
5.0,"Ok packaging.  This is my 3rd or 4th set, always a great purchase."
5.0,"LOVE THESE! I didn't realize I had low arches until I took a test right before buying these. I didn't even have to break these in. I wore them to the gym and could not have been more comfortable. I've worn them to Disneyland in my boots, 2-days in a row working an athletic event, and repeatedly to the gym. I first had them in my Nikes and now have them in my new Asics Duomax. The woman who helped me has been working in athletic shoes for years and said it was a ""pretty well-made orthotic."""
4.0,Make shoes fit where heel rubs but good arch support.
5.0,These are great for my feet-high arches and plantar fasciitis. The price is right too!
4.0,"Seems to help.  I had to reinsert my soles under them because there wasn't much cushion in the heel, but long hours on my feet at work aren't killing me now."
5.0,Great deal on a great orthotic.  You would easily pay $40 or more in a retail store for these.
5.0,Love these.  Thinking about buying a pair for my husband.  I've been wearing these for about 5 years.  My podiatrist was impressed with them also.  Just wondering if you ever have coupons for these?  I usually order two pair at a time.  Thank you so much for these.
5.0,"I wear these in my tennis shows and have successfully avoided a recurrence of my plantar fasciitis.
Coupled with a foot roller and calf stretching. These are particularly long lasting."
5.0,Thanks very much I really like this item
4.0,less than half price of Dr. Sholls and just as good if not better.
5.0,"Very firm , great arch- No more foot pain."
5.0,excellent relief for insteps
5.0,"I have feet problems and the podiatrist suggested these to me back in 2008. I've been wearing them ever since and they work great. I've probably bought more than a half dozen pairs since then and would say each pair has lasted at least a year if not longer. The retail on them is $40, but after the first pair I have been able to find them online for half or less, so this is a good deal. I've bought and tried other inserts, but these are about as close to a $300 custom orthotic as you can get."
5.0,The best there is on the market.......excellent support and comfort.
5.0,"So far these orthotic inserts are working great. They feel like my real orthodics that I paid $200 for. I've been wearing them in my running shoes, so we'll see how they hold up before I order more."
5.0,These were recommended by a Physical Therapist and they have given me great support.
5.0,I  love these.  I had worn some from a Podiatrist.  They were the Pro kind; but these seem to be about the same.
5.0,Love these have been using them for 8 years
5.0,"No more arch pain, fabulous!"
5.0,A little more cushion than the Powerstep Protech but the arch is maybe just a little lower. We love both styles. Excellent for plantar fasciitis and neuromas.
5.0,Arrived a day early. Item was as described.
4.0,Put these in my hiking boots when I developed plantar fasciitis.  Haven't used them that much but they seem adequate and the PF is abating.
5.0,Insets work very well. Havent had a recurrence of my plantar Fascitis since I've been wearing them
5.0,"Have bought them before and know the product. Not disappointed, as usual."
5.0,great product.  order these multiple times per year for running shoes and work shoes alike.
5.0,Perfect insoles for those on their feet all day.
5.0,Very comfortable
5.0,Recommended by my podiatrist ... Foot pain is gone ... Use them in all my shoes
5.0,Second pair I've bought. They hold up really well.
5.0,These provide the support I need and are less expensive here on Amazon than my local running shop.
5.0,"Have used the Powerstep Pinnacle for about 8 years now to replace custom made orthotics. They do a great job at supporting my arches, provide great cushioning, and are very durable. I use them in my running shoes, tennis shoes, and everyday work shoes."
5.0,fit good
5.0,The best
5.0,Recommended by my Orthopedic Doctor. These are so much less expensive on Amazon than buying in his office! I will be back again.
5.0,These are wonderfully supportive and ease my foot pain.  I've used them for a couple years now and won't put shoes on without them.
4.0,Great for standard wear use. Wish it had more arch.  They make a sturdier insole with similar name I wear working on concrete floors 8+ hours/five days a week.  I LOVE the OTHER heavier duty insole.
3.0,"These innersoles seem well made, and they may work well for other folks, but for me, the arches weren't high enough."
5.0,"Still a great product! I have used these for years, will keep ordering them."
5.0,These insoles stopped all of the pain from plantar fasciitis.
5.0,These are my second pair as the first pair assisted in my plantar problems.
3.0,Great support but the thickness makes it challenging to wear with shoes. I have to take out the original soles in order to wear these ones.
4.0,Easy to use. Might be helping with the pain in my foot somewhat. Hard to tell the long term effects yet.
5.0,"These are the best over-the-counter insoles I have bought!  I was buying Dr. Scholl's custom insoles, which were more expensive than the Pinnacle insoles.  Pinnacles are a full insole unlike the Scholls.  There is a world of difference between these and others that I have tried.  For Plantar Fasciitis they are wonderful.  I highly recommend purchasing the Pinnacles."
5.0,Fits great and helped a lot
5.0,Best inserts I have ever purchased!
5.0,"Good value, great fit, and I highly recommend."
3.0,Too bulky for me.  My feet felt tightened because of the extra bulk.
5.0,Confortable .
5.0,"terrific, really comfortable if you need arch support"
5.0,"Great product, price  and service!!"
5.0,"Awesome product.
I have plantar fasciitis and these inserts have helped immensely.  The pain eased the day after I started wearing them and went away within a week.  I bought several pairs -- to put in all my sneakers and even in my slippers.  If you tend to wear a lot of flat soled shoes (sandals, etc) put these in your sneakers and you will feel the effects immediately!"
5.0,"These insoles have saved me from chronic plantar fasciitis and related heel pain. I now buy my shoes based on whether I can remove the factory insole and put these in there. They far exceed the support of any insoles I was able to buy at my local drug or big box stores. You pay for what you get, and these are worth the cost."
5.0,"I've had these insoles before, and they lasted for several years.  I need cushioning and arch support, so I ordered another pair.  They shipped quickly and seem to be just as high quality as the last pair. They are a much more durable product than most of what is available in grocery and drug stores"
5.0,My doctor suggested trying these since I have a high arch. They help tremendously with my plantar fasciitis.
4.0,"I recently purchased these at my running store to replace my custom orthotics which are wearing out. Actually I first tried Superfeet because my running buddies were recommending them but they gave me almost no arch support. Fortunately I was able to exchange the Superfeet for Pinnacle at my running store (Thank you, Run With Us!) and so far they feel great! I have high arch and history of plantar fasciitis so this seems to work well. I am a marathoner and run pretty high miles so hopefully these last for awhile. Amazon price is comparable to my running store's but next time I will purchase through Amazon because of the convenience."
5.0,Amazing! Just wore these the day after they arrived for a 5-day conference. After being on my feet for hours walking the exhibit hall and to/from sessions - they stood up to all expectations. It's the first time I haven't dreaded the ache of putting my feet on the ground the next morning. I could walk miles with these in the most poorly constructed shoes.
5.0,"Works great, my hips and and feet no longer hurt!"
4.0,"These inserts are nice, good quality, along the lines of superfeet inserts, but with a bit more cushion. They are very supportive and they do help my feet, I have some plantar fasciitis going on right now and these are helping."
5.0,Very nice product
5.0,"It absolutely works! Because of my plantar fasciitis I can't walk without these insoles, can't stand for several hours during working day as well."
5.0,Great!  Thank you!
5.0,I have been wearing Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles since I had plantar fasciitis three years ago.  I wear them in every shoe.  They are great.  The only time I do not use Powerstep Pinnacle insoles is when I am using Powerstep Original insoles.  The original insoles are thinner and fit in my smaller/tighter shoes.
5.0,Great inserts which provide fine service for an extended period of time.
4.0,very helpful for foot fatigue
2.0,These things fell apart after less than a year and I don't even walk that much at work.
5.0,These are great insoles. I use them in my running shoes. They are great to use if you have plantar fasciitis.
5.0,These are the best insoles I have found for any price.
5.0,Great product recommended by my podiatrist.  Have them in all my shoes.
5.0,Great!
1.0,I didn't feel a difference. waste of money. don't buy
4.0,works
5.0,VERY comfortable.  Makes the world of difference.
5.0,"After developing some annoying foot issues during my deployment, including plantar fasciitis, these were recommended to me by another Airman in my unit. These are awesome! Well, for me at least. It took about a day to get used to them once I put them in my boots, but after that, what a difference they made. After a few days, my foot pain had nearly disappeared, and I no longer had significant plantar fasciitis symptoms. Going on a few months now and they're still working great! Highly recommended!"
5.0,"bought at same time as the brown inserts they both work equally, worth the money, my feet haven't hurt in four years!"
5.0,I have owned these before. The only brand I will buy because they provide the greatest arch support than any other brand. However I returned them as I wanted the shorter ones for my dress shoes.  I already have the longer ones for my athletic shoes. The shorter pair fit great in my dress shoes.  I would not be without them!!!!
4.0,"As someone who needed extra arch support in my shoes, I'd like to really thank the other customers/reviewers here, because it was based on your many positive reviews that I decided to try the Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles after having tried many other brands with very limited success. Hands down, these are the most comfortable, effective insoles I've ever worn in my shoes. When I wear them, it's like I never had any problem with plantar fasciatis. The pain is gone, the sore legs and feet are gone. Just normal walking and even exercising without discomfort. As a result, I'm going to be buying additional pairs so I can add them to my other shoes without having to change the insoles every time I change my shoes.

The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is I'm a tall guy (6 ft 8 ins) with a size 15-16 foot. And Pinnacle's largest size is rated at only 14.5 for men, meaning they come up short in my shoes. But no problem, I traced the outline of my shoes' regular insole and then cut out a matching add-on piece from an old pair of Spenco flat insoles to attach to the Pinnacle insole in the toes area so I don't get any friction/rubbing there. So please Pinnacle, how about making a size 15-16 version of your insoles???

I should also say, I'm writing this review after having worn the Pinnacle insoles constantly in my shoes for more than a month since my purchase, including a lot of daily exercise walking. So if any comfort or durability issues were going to arise, they would have arisen by now. None have. Much to my chagrin, before Pinnacle, I spent close to $200 on a pair of custom-made podiatrist designed insoles that never really felt comfortable on my feet or alleviated my discomfort. I've also got a drawerful of other store-bought insoles that helped a little to varying extents, but still ultimately left my feet and legs and back sore and uncomfortable.

At least for me and my feet, the Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles really did the job. They're thin enough that I can wear them comfortably in most of my styles of shoes. They're not thick and spongy like some of the New Balance arch support insoles. And it seems to me that the Pinnacles have a firmer (higher?) and more supportive arch area than the Spenco Total Support insoles that I bought and tried at the same time as the Pinnacles. So once again, thanks to everyone here who finally pointed me in the direction of a real solution to my plantar woes."
5.0,These do the trick!
5.0,"Amazing! They make such a huge difference, no more arch pain."
5.0,I have been using these insoles for a while and the blue fabric on top is starting to peel off. Kind of expensive for being thin insoles. I will try gel insoles next.
5.0,very good insole;  good arch support for a high arch and excellent cushioning
5.0,Good insole for planters.  Helped.
5.0,great comfort
4.0,"I got a pair of these for my son years ago  the recommendation of his podiatrist. They worked well, and he eventually told me that they were showing signs of wear and getting small. I was surprised to look back at my records an see how long they lasted. They do what the podiatrist said they would, and had they not worked, I'm sure I would have needed to have taken my son back for follow up visits.  They fall short of what custom orthotics will do, and for some sizes they can be expensive, but they are generally a good value."
5.0,Best orthotic we have found and this is the best price we found in years of buying them! Great fit and comfort! This seller shipped super fast...highly recommend!
4.0,"Purchased these for my hiking shoes, then walked (and walked and walked) and hiked through Europe for two weeks.  They really provided that extra arch support I was looking for.  Planning on ordering some more for my work-out shoes."
5.0,Love these have had a couple pairs. Put them in all my shoes..
5.0,BUY THEM!!!! Super comfortable. I've purchased a lot of inserts in my day and nothing compares to these. They were comfortable right out of the box. I'm on my feet 10 hours a day and they've given me back the spring in my step. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!!!
3.0,These are very comfortable with good arch support.  A co-worker and I started using these at the same time.  I went through 2 pairs to his 1.  The fabric around the heel peeled off mine within a few weeks and with a couple months the foam started tearing.
5.0,"Solved my plantar faciitis.  Of the different Powerstep options, the pinnacle is my favorite."
5.0,"Best insoles, I hardly have any pain left."
5.0,I have purchased 4 pairs of these now.  They have literally saved my feet from surgery for a bone spur.  Great arch support and comfort.
5.0,My podiatrist suggested them for my painful feet as my job working at a hospital has really caused me some pain. They help a tremendous amount.
5.0,I like these inserts in my tennis shoes.
5.0,I got these to go in my tennis shoes. I had plantar fasciitis and my podiatrist suggested them. They take getting used to because most shoes have horrible insoles with no arch support. Now that I have them I can't do without them.  I wore the first ones out so I need new ones. I work in retail so they only last about six months. I think it would also depend on you weight also. I would definitely suggest these inserts.
5.0,Wonderful product for keeping plantar fasciitis away! My partner and I use them religiously.
4.0,"Surprising arch support, I am quite pleased."
5.0,"I love the full length Powerstep insoles.  These are as good, if not better, than the more expensive brands I've tried.  I also have tried the gel-type half size insoles which just don't supply the comfort of the Powerstep.  I know different things work differently for different people but I'm totally sold on these full length insoles."
4.0,"Good product, can't train without them!"
5.0,A+++ great product
4.0,Good
5.0,Very comfortable. Fit nicely in my shoes. I recommend this product.
5.0,"LOVE IT!  I have lots of heal pain, this helps"
3.0,These are okay though the maroon Powerstep have more arch and support.
5.0,They fit great!
2.0,I was unable to wear my shoes with these in them. They may fit in my sneakers but I need them for work shoes and the made the shoes way too tight.
5.0,Great Product and a great price
5.0,Very good!!
5.0,Even my podiatrist recommends these
4.0,"I like the powerstep pinnacle but when talking to MayDay on Amazon I asked if they were wide with  and the person said 'YES'. I would rather have Grey color which is wide with!
I have lots of pain in my feet especially in the Metatarsalgia area (Pad of foot or balls of the foot) and I believe there is a new Red pair coming out. All in all they do feel good on my feet. Will keep them even if not wide feet!"
5.0,"recommended by my podiatrist for my achilles tendonitis, have had very good results.
This is my second pair and I will keep putting them in my shoes unless I find something better.
Good quality for the price which is a fraction of custom orthotics."
3.0,"I bought these to replace an inexpensive pair of Dr Scholls inserts that served me very well by helping my boots and oxfords (1.5 inch heel) stay put. Sometimes it's tight shoes that cause corns and bunions, but sometimes it's shoes that are too loose that allow your feet to move back and forth; both scenarios cause friction and can harm your tootsies. That being said, these are not going to work for me because they eat up too much of the depth of the boot so that all of my toes are tight against the top of the boot. I did try to cut them down bit into a more 3/4 length, and they feel better, but I think in the end the heel cup is too wide for my narrow heel cup; I have several other custom made units that do have a narrow heel cup but don't always work either. they work in my slippers so maybe that's where they will be used. I'll keep them to experiment (I guess I have no choice now that I cut them :)) and who knows there still might be a use for them.
Seems like a good product for the right shoe."
5.0,works great..
5.0,Great support
3.0,"Thicker than the plain powersteps, so not as practical...but still very comfortable if you have a bigger shoe that you can fit them (and your foot) in."
5.0,"I've used these powersteps for years and am always impressed by their quality and support. I fully recommend them, especially for people like me who have high arches."
5.0,I buy these all the time at the running store for twice the price.  I was leery about purchasing but was so happy that they were the same inserts I'm used to for a great value.  They arrived intact and ahead of schedule!
1.0,Quick shipping. Would buy agian. A+
5.0,"Best insoles I have found for plantar fasciitis.  They have a high arch and feel comfortable being on your feet all day.  I like these better than my custom orthotics as the heel is softer.  My custom orthotics are carbon fiber but no cushion on the heel where I have heel spurs.

since they aren't carbon fiber costing 100s of $$$, they do wear out after a year or 2 at the most.

I now only buy shoes where the insole is removable so I can replace it with these.

I have a huge collection of different orthotics and liked these even better than powerstep pinnacle maxx as I could feel the corners on those insoles and it was uncomfortable.  I can't use that pair and gave them to my wife."
5.0,These replace identical insoles for which I paid much more.  Husband loves them and wanted nothing else.
5.0,Throw out the insert in your athletic shoes and use these!!
5.0,"The product is excellent...still waiting to return the wrong size that I rec'd, though.  Oh, call tag, where are you?"
5.0,A very good product.
5.0,"After paying $300 for custom-made orthotics, I wanted to give these a try. I had my #1 metatarsals shortened to relieve the stress on the toe joint, but the weight of walking got shifted to my 2nd metatarsal and it has been giving me pain.  I purchased a set of these and put them in some shoes that weren't prone to work very well with orthotics.  So far so good.  I work in situations where I have to do a lot of walking and I am encouraged by the early results."
5.0,Nearly as good as custom
5.0,"These work for me and are priced competitively plus they seem to hold up to daily use.  I have a set of Dr. made arch supports that are 3/4 length, but they cut into my feet and are hard plastic, I prefer these padded arch supports that are full length and can flex some with work shoes, dress shoes or even athletic shoes.  The Powerstep Pinacle meets my needs.  See the ""Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx Orthotic Insoles"" version if you need even more support."
5.0,These inserts have made a huge difference in how my feet feel. I won't wear sneakers without them!
5.0,"I normally use Pinnacle Maxx Inserts, but they seem to be too much arch support for my feet.  These are more of a mid rise arch support which makes them much more comfortable for me."
5.0,Great product
5.0,Great
2.0,"These have too high of a heel. On top of that they have no real cushioning either. They have a tiny bit more cushioning that the standard ones, but that is not saying much. I don't understand how these get the good reviews they do. I had to send them back."
5.0,"I have worn these inserts for 4 years. They were first recomended and sold to me by a doctor, who said I needed to wear these always to protect my ankles and feet. Have aways been happy with the product and plan to wear them always."
5.0,Delivered in a resonable time and fit they are just what I wantec
5.0,Just the same as the ones the foot Dr ripped me off with. Perfect!
5.0,Great
5.0,Good product. Very happy.
5.0,Works real good
4.0,Very comfortable with grewt arch support.
5.0,"Work great for my flat feet, super comfy"
5.0,Keeps my feet from hurting. Love them
5.0,I've bought these before....and really like them.  They help my foot pain from bunions.  they are the same ones that the podiatrist sells but cost a lot less.
5.0,Insoles are very accord with the surface of the foot the natural curve of the insole material has good friction effect Foot will not slide in the shoe pad in feeling very comfortable shoes
5.0,"Love it, My flat feet love them. put right into my Nike Monarch AIRs"
5.0,I can feel the support that I need now. they fit very comfortable in my working shoes.. I'm a very happy person.
5.0,"I like these a lot, although I wish I could get the thicker orange/yellow Powerstep insoles that are available in my local running store.  These will be fine for my everyday casual shoes, while I use the thicker ones for my walking shoes."
4.0,"Wear a woman's 9 and this size is a perfect fit. Insoles work ok, better than nothing."
5.0,going to order more.  my back is much better and I've put in two pairs of shoes already.
5.0,"The powerstep pinnacle is quite comfortable.  I have just ordered two more pairs, another for myself and a pair
for my grand daughter who also has flat feet and fallen arches. They were shipped and delivered quicker
then I expected."
5.0,Totally satisfied.
5.0,"Perfectly fits all my sneakers and dress shoes, after a few days of use arch support completely cleared all foot pain on both feet, again I can  exercise/walk for forty minutes without any foot pain at all, arch support also helps to redistribute the weight evenly as you walk, away from the big toe.."
5.0,These puppy's have saved my puppy's. I have extremely sensitive feet. It's very hard to find shoes anymore that don't hurt my feet. I can ware any shoe now with these soles. I had undiagnosed plantar fascitis but thanks to the nice arch in these soles I'm healed!!! I wear these in all my shoes and even run with them. My feet no longer hurt. I've worn out three pairs since I started using them.
3.0,These are OK but I still had to go and get some custom made ones
2.0,It feels good to support your feet. The only problem is that it doesn't last long. The pair I had gets badly worn in about 3-4months.
5.0,Great help for my sore feet after jogging.
5.0,"I now own a pair of these, one of the Powerstep Green, and a pair of ABEO insoles from the Walking Company.  Prices were roughly $24, $44, and $70, respectively.  I actually like the most expensive ones from the Walking Company the least and the other two pair about the same.  I will definitely order these in the future since I believe they are the best value for the money."
5.0,LOVE !
5.0,These have made a big difference in my foot comfort.  My podiatrist recommended them.
5.0,"My 4th pair, made from a slightly padded stiff but formed laminate.  I've tried the gel types to relieve pain in my heel but they did not help and felt heavy.  The Powerstep seems lighter and seems to distribute the load in comparison to the gel type."
5.0,Works wonders!!
5.0,Fabulous! These are great support! Thank you!
5.0,These are the only ones I buy! Great inserts!
5.0,"I use inserts in all of my shoes, superfeet are better for my feet, but these help a lot too."
5.0,They are awesome
5.0,Perfect support for a marathon runner with high arches!
5.0,Perfect fit.
5.0,"I love this insole, i replaced most of my shoes with my
Powerstep Pinnacle Adult's Insole Blue Women's"
5.0,They are comfortable and easy to put in shoes.  I love them.
4.0,Got them quickly with Prime and have been using them for about a week now.  Fit perfectly replacing the pad in my New Balance sneakers.  The old one were falling apart and would give me blisters if used running or hiking.  These insoles were comfortable immediately and I am glad to have them giving new life to my shoes.  I will add/subtract my rating after I see how they work for a few months.  Reviews have been good so I hope they hold up.
5.0,Make my hiking boot that much more comfortable and do a pretty good job of relieving heel pain from plantar fasciitis.
5.0,These insoles were recommended by my doctor and have been using them for 4 years.
5.0,These are great for help with flat feet.  I have a set in every shoe I wear.
5.0,"I had to travel to Argentina, where you walk a lot, I'm writing the review from Buenos Aires, I couldn't have done it without the insoles.
When I get back to the States I will order a few more pairs of insoles,so I don't have to keep changing them from shoes to shoes.
Great product so far and don't expect any problems, already have about fourty kilometers on them.
I would definitely recommend this product.
Vince"
5.0,These insoles help a lot since my son has flat feet & he has to run most of the time!
5.0,Excellent product.

3.0,maybe my feet are a little differnt  left feels great  right not soo but still comfy
5.0,"Very comfortable, great arch support. These insoles really helped my heel pain. I use them in my sneakers."
4.0,"Purchased these insoles for my ski boots.  So far I have put in two (2) 8 hr days with them in, and they are doing just what I want them to."
5.0,We have become regular users of these item.....eliminates foot pain and discomfort totally for us....could walk and stand wearing the shoes with these inserts for very long time...
5.0,"These are great for my sons feet that has no arches.
~Christina V Saunders"
5.0,"These work great!  When I wear them in my athletic shoes and some others where they will fit, I find my feet don't hurt at the end of the day. My knees feel much better, too.  They provide great arch support.  My physical therapist highly recommended these after I had knee surgery.  They are a bit pricey but I find it well worth it."
5.0,I have put these orthotic inserts into my winter shoes that I wear all day long. They haverovided me with great support for my flat feet. I bought these because my arches are flat and they were bothering me without the added support. I no longer have a pain in my arches. They work great and are very reasonably priced. I will definitely keep these in mind when I need another pair.
5.0,Have two pairs and want more for all my shoes.
5.0,These are great when you are on your feet a lot!
5.0,if you want a firm arch this is the one for you. feels good to me.
5.0,Works great. Able to stand and walk longer.
5.0,Top notch insole very high quality. Put these in a new pair of New Balance shoes and they may well have been more comfortable than the model twice the price.
4.0,ALL IS WELL.
4.0,I have plantar fasciitis which is very crippling. I bought these after a doctor recommended them. They have provided such relief that I am able to walk without limping. They are wonderful. Absolutely recommend them.
5.0,been using for years and will buy again....can't walk well without them.
5.0,I buy these for all my running shoes
5.0,My wife's foot dr. said to try these before fitting for an insert. They did work for her and a heck of a lot cheaper. Will be ordering more for all her shoes.
5.0,"nice , good price"
5.0,"These are my favorite insoles!  I have a pair for every pair of running and walking shoe.  The price is good, too, better than at a running/sports store."
5.0,Best inserts I can find without purchasing expensive custom orthotics!
5.0,"These work great. I've worn them in my tennis shoes for walking and in snow boots (fashion boots) that have no support whatsoever. I wore the boots the whole day and my feet never hurt once! I would highly recommend these.
PS my husband ordered a pair and wears them in all of his shoes!"
5.0,BIG help to my feet!
5.0,"Good insoles.  Similar to green superfeet in arch support.  These have more cushion and I like them better in my running shoes.  Still prefer the other ones in my work boots and dress shoes.  Quality wise, they take second.  But at half the price, they are definitely worth it."
5.0,Great product!!!
2.0,"After having these a couple of months, the toxic rubber/sweat smell that emanates from my boots after taking them off at the end of the day is not something I can deal with anymore. The inserts are well made. Maybe it would be ok if you put them in tennis shoes that breath better?
Long story short don't buy these if you plan on putting them in work boots or shoes that are enclosed."
4.0,These inserts are very good for those with high arches needing support.  I usually get a new pair whenever I get new running shoes.
5.0,Great support without being too rigid. The whole family uses them.
5.0,Helpful and unbeatable arch support.
5.0,Very cool
5.0,"Liked the first pair so much I bought five pair over the last year for all my other shoes. They're great, except the blue lining will start to rub off and can get annoying."
5.0,good product
5.0,Arrived on time and product as promised.
3.0,These are ok. Not sure they are as good at SuperFeet but at least they are cheaper.
5.0,They work really well and make my arches feel much better.
2.0,"Unfortunately I did not like these, they hurt my feet...I gave it a valiant effort in wearing them for a few days and just couldn't do it any longer."
5.0,Better that expected
4.0,"They seem to give enough support, delivery was slow."
5.0,Great fory plantar fascitis!
5.0,"Years ago I broke my right foot while deployed to Afghanistan. Ever since it has caused me issues, ""hot heels"" and plantar fasciitis. Mainly hot heels. I have tried quite a few other products, even ""cutom"" orthopedic made"" insoles which never quite fit correctly, and were never comfortable or as soft feeling as these.

I was reading the reviews of these and insoles that cost twice as much and decided to start with the less expensive of the few. The first week or so was not much difference to me, but the pain was noticeably less. The insoles were a bit weird feeling at first. But here I am a week later and am VERY happy to report my heel pain and arch pain is literally completely gone. I want to wear my work steel toes everywhere now as they seriously feel that much more comfortable.

I am already looking into purchasing a few more pairs to avoid swapping these around as they are not easy to install or remove from my steel toes. Even if these only last me a few months I would gladly purchase another set."
4.0,Works fine
4.0,"This is a great product. My wife uses custom orthotics from 5 years ago, in combination with the pinntacle orthotics that I just bought she is walking almost without pain."
5.0,"These inserts have taken the pain out of walking for me. I have a heel spur, and with these inserts I am pain free. I will always keep these inserts in my shoes."
5.0,RECIPE FOR FALLEN ARCHES!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,Helped my heal spur pain significantly.
5.0,very useful - make a big difference
3.0,Too long for shoes
5.0,only used this for a few days so far but works well
5.0,excellent
5.0,These insoles are very comfortable. I can stay on my feet for ss long time. I feel like I'm walking on air. I ordered 2 for my convenience. I suffer with plantar ficiatis so this is the route for me. Amazon offers the Best price for this insole.
5.0,My feet feel better that what I expected.  This is a Great Product.
5.0,my husband love the product but took a long time for delivery
4.0,I ordered with the advice of a foot doctor.  The are great buy for the money.  I walk on my treadmill  a lot and now I have less back pain.  Really supports the arch well.  Cheaper then ones from CVS
5.0,i have been using these for over ten years and couldn't walk without them.
5.0,Good product
2.0,"They are so huge there is no space for my feet in my shoe when i put them in. Avoid, unless your shoe is 10x the size of your foot."
5.0,"Much better than the insteps which come with the shoes, even with SAS shoes. Comfortable and supportive from the getgo."
4.0,"2nd set, been using for 2 years. Not as pleased now may try different brand when new set needed."
5.0,I use Powerstep Pinnacle Adult's Insoles in all my walking shoes. They keep legs and hips aligned and really cuts down on the pain in my back. Suggest you break them in buy wearing them for short periods of time until you build up to full time. I would not go walking without them in my shoes.
5.0,I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis several years ago.  And as a bartender I spend hours on my feet doing  thing to fert that feet should not do.  I haven't had a flair up of pain since day one
5.0,Great shoe insoles for my tennis shoes.
5.0,I officiate NCAA basketball I have tried all inserts for my Nike 360 Air Maxs and by far these are the best!!  Every pair of my shoes have a pair of these in them....
5.0,"My husband and I have these in all our shoes. When my flat footed son started complaining of foot pain, I ordered these right away. He prefers them to his custom orthodics."
5.0,Fine.  No problems.
5.0,These inserts work great with my fallen arch.  I would recommend them to anyone.
4.0,"These are good, but the more cushioned Powerstep Protech full length is my favorite.  Helps my aching heels to feel better when standing and walking all day."
5.0,"These work for me, may or may not work for you. But they helped with pain in my foot and arch. Plus they last about 6-9 months."
5.0,"Great Price, Great product.

Thanks"
4.0,"Good product, comfy, good price"
5.0,Best insoles ever. Never thought my heel would get better! Highly recommend.
5.0,I really like this product.  I'm glad my podiatrist introduced me to it.  This is my second pair.
5.0,Supportive!
5.0,I buy a pair of these for all my shoes.  They are lifesavers with my plantar fasciitis and bunion problems.
5.0,"Great orthotics.  They really help with my plantar fasciitis.  I have been wearing these for years now and my feet feel so much better, and Amazon has them for the best price I have seen anywhere.  ."
4.0,"I have tried many insoles and shoe accessories and I have settled on these.  Some of the insole and accessories I have tried:

- Powerstep Pinnacle burgundy insoles
- The Walking Company's leather insoles
- ProFit heel cups
- Scholls gel insoles
- Scholls gel arch support
- WalkFit arch supports
- New Balance insoles
- SuperFeet Merino insoles
- Etc.

YMMV.  The Powerstep blue (not the burgundy which I found too hard) is a nice all-around solution.  I do not think it would fix PF on its own but it helps in conjunction with a night splint.

I use the WalkFits in my slippers as they slide around in my regular shoes and the Powerstep Blue are fullsized and more comfortable for walking.  The WalkFits are rigid and hard (and inexpensive) arch supports and they feel very supportive.

The Powersteps are thick and need shoes with enough volume (and usually a removable insole) to work.  I do have a pair of boots that are roomy enough to take these (barely) on top of the existing insole.

For PF I find the Powerstep in most shoes, a thick arch support in shoes that cannot fit the Powerstep and a night splint to keep things working properly.

Night splint available on Amazon: Active Ankle Dns Dorsal Night Splint."
3.0,"seemed to be good at first but I don't think the person at the shoe store realized the type of activity I would be doing.
these put way too much pressure on my arch so after several weeks and months it made my feet feel worse!  dog ended up chewing them to bits so I threw them out, no huge loss, they were near the end of their ""life"" anyway"
5.0,"I was looking for an insole to help with my Achilles Tendonitis after finding out that Birkenstock ones aggravated it.  I put a heel pad underneath the Powerstep Pinnacles--raising the heel helps with Achilles Tendonitis. These insoles also have excellent arch support, since I have high arches."
5.0,I don't wear a pair of shoes without these in them. My feet feel fab with them and hurt without them. Bought a set for work and play shoes.
3.0,"I bought these thinking they would help my foot pain.  I have high arches so these seemed perfect.  They felt good in my shoes, but my foot pain didn't subside.  If anything, it got worse.  I took them out and things have improved.  They seem to be of good quality but they didn't cure my aching feet."
5.0,"Helps my heel pain in my dressier shoes.
Very good support -  overall its stiff not floppy, with a gel pad for the heel.  But its a bit  too much for good athletic shoes which already have decent arch support.

Not as ""cushy"" as others I've tried . like Dr Scholls gels for heel pain, but those aren't designed for arch support, so I still use them in sneakers.

I wear size 10, but bought 9 - 9.5, because at the time it was  $10 cheaper for some reason!  No problems."
5.0,This is my fourth pair. Long lasting and they make walking long distances a joy.
5.0,"These are the best for people with arch problems. Wish they were cheaper since the insoles have, on occasion, cost more than the shoes I'm putting them in...but they are worth it. They hold up well, too. I keep a few pairs in rotation and swap them between pairs of shoes as I need. They do take up quite a bit of space in the shoe, so I save them for sneakers and boots. Not great for slim profile or tight fitting shoes."
4.0,I like the insoles for my shoes they give me the needed support
3.0,Nice insoles but don't hold up. They will flatten out after a few months use.
5.0,I have been wearing powerstep for many years. I have high arches and my feet ache a lot! The Pinnacles are great to wear in my athletic or walking/hiking shoes. Very comfortable and I love the stiffer support they provide. They are a little too big for dress shoes so I use my original powersteps in them. I get the 8-8.5 and they work great in my size 9 shoes.
5.0,good support
5.0,Excellent price.  If you need them.. Get this.
5.0,"My husband uses these, and he loves them.  Good price and quick delivery."
5.0,WOW--NICE STUFF AND SUPER FAST. EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND PACKED VERY WELL THANKS
5.0,"If I could give this product 10 stars I would. I spent 13+ hours a day on my feet on cement floors and it felt like the bones in my feet were puncturing through the bottom,even though the inserts I did have were a good 3/4 inch thick with gel. I got these in the mail and my heart sank at the sight of how paper thin they are. I gave them a chance even though I knew they would hurt my feet even more. I didn't even have to break them in. They caused me no new pain and prevented any pain even after standing for 13 + hours. They are worth it. BUY THEM!"
5.0,Solved all of my foot issues.  Recommended by my foot doctor.
5.0,great no heel pain at all
4.0,Great
5.0,"BEST Insole for my tennis shoes I walk every day and foot doctor told me about these, worth every penny."
5.0,Completely satisfied!
5.0,"I have been looking for a good pair of insoles for over 6 months to help with a stubborn case of PF. I wear boots all day and i got to the point were limping into work and when i get up out of a chair was a normal condition. After cortisone shots in the heel and orthotics prescribed by a ""so-called"" podiatrist, i just gave up.
I discovered these insoles originally at ""the insole store"" online and my feet fell in love and are after 1 week almost pain free (in conjunction with using the ""Rubz"" ball). In any case, Amazon sells them $10.00 cheaper. I'm up to three pair and i plan on getting a couple more just in case."
4.0,vey dependable as always
4.0,I'm very impressed with the powerstep insole it helped to relieve a lot of pressure from my heel spur would highly recommend.
5.0,"Been pretty happy with these so far. Although I still deal with plantar fasciitis, it does seem to help a lot when I wear these in my shoes. I would order again."
5.0,Great product.
5.0,"Awesome product, price and quality!"
5.0,"I put these in every shoe I can. They feel awesome and completely revive old running shoes that I thought were worn out. I am a light weight, avid exerciser/runner/tennis player with plantar fasciitis. These have changed my life."
5.0,"This is the second pair of Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles I have purchased, and I love them so much. I have very bad feet and even wearing very good quality shoes, I still sometimes have trouble. These insoles make up the difference for me- I definitely notice when I'm not wearing them! I actually purchased these for my sister who is having trouble with her feet and back and she absolutely loves them too! Definitely recommend these to anyone!"
5.0,Best damn insoles ever made. You hear that ? EVER made. Don't go and buy some squishy POS from walmart that says you are going to be a comfortable as some ancient astronomer. I bet that guys feet were in horrible pain walking around in flat sandals all day long. In fact I bet that if that astronomer were alive today he would have a pair of these since smart people do their research and all research leads to these.
4.0,My podiatrist recommended these for my plantar fasciitis.  They were thicker than I expected so it made my shoes a little squashed but they've helped with my pain so I'm happy.
3.0,Ouch. So much arch support. Just plain ouch.
5.0,"For years I have suffered from plantar fasciitis which is often called heel spurs.  An on-line podiatrist recommended taking no steps without Powerstep inserts or prescription orthotic inserts, and following this advice has eliminated a problem I had for years.  As expensive as Powerstep inserts are they are much less than prescription inserts.  One can afford more than one pair reducing the need to transfer from shoe to shoe."
5.0,"My Podiatrist recommended these to help with pronation.  They definitely work.  They provide support and a bit of cushioning.  Great in my tennis shoes for working out.  Easy to keep clean.  I've hand washed these with soap and water and let them air dry, they look like they'll last after a year of wear."
5.0,wear them with my tennis shoes ... good arch support
2.0,The arch support was way to aggressive; and I've got a fairly high arch to my feet. Uncomfortable. I gave up on them after six or so sessions - kept hoping for improvement that never happened.
4.0,great feel
5.0,They do the job
5.0,"Really makes a difference after a week or so.
May seem like not working at first -
reviews tell a good story.
Helped with uneven left vs right leg due to knee."
4.0,"They work well , don't last long enough."
5.0,These have been a godsend since I was recently diagnosed with plantar fasciitis!
2.0,Not comfortable
5.0,Our son needed these to help with some ankle pain.  The problem cleared right up when he started wearing them.  He still wears them in his shoes now.
4.0,"These are very good inserts. They don't last me very long.  The price has increased dramatically, which means I may have to do some bargain shopping for another brand."
5.0,Excellent product almost equal to prescription shoe insert
5.0,Great product! Very happy with purchase.
5.0,These insoles help my heels feel much better.  I would never wear a pair of athletic shoes with the original insoles.
5.0,These insoles work great to relieve pressure on the heels of my feet.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has problems with the heel or arch on their feet.
5.0,Very good quality. Easy to slip in and out of different shoes. Stay in place well.
5.0,"Great product. A little pricey (their prices have doubled in the last couple of years, but the product is exactly the same)."
5.0,Fit very well and are most comfortable.
5.0,"Ahhh!  Relief for my PF!  I wish I had bought these first, would have saved  myself alot of money and time."
5.0,great service and product!!!
5.0,love these!
4.0,"Love the built in arch. Had to trim a little. Unfortunately, if you don't have a lot of room in your shoes, and the insoles don't come out, they may be tight. However, I did find some pairs that they work in. And they are a perfect fit for my flat feet."
3.0,great
5.0,"I love this insole.  I would like even a bit more (higher) arch support and even stiffer construction, but of all of the off-the-shelf arch supports I have tried, this one is the best.  If you are looking for a cushion for your show, this isn't it.  Go with a gel heel/forefoot insert for that, but if you want arch support, this is the best I can find.  Hard-wearing too.  Give them a try, if you like them, get some for all your shoes, they are a bit annoying to swap out every time you change shoes."
5.0,"Works great, my feet feel much better."
5.0,These are just what the doctor ordered.  Literally.
5.0,These add padding without overpowering the existing footbed.
5.0,Like it
5.0,Great product!
5.0,Help with my plantar faciitis. Fits in all my sneakers
4.0,"The inserts arrived on time and as advertised. They are very thick and I can only use them in one pair of old sneakers. Once I figured that out, they immediately stopped my feet from hurting.  In all other shoes, they push my feet against the top of my shoes, which hurts as much or more than not using it at all.  For the rest of my shoes, I'll have to order the original power steps.  Less thick and much more versatile."
5.0,"I've been using custom orthotics for 20 years.  I have tried many off the shelf orthotics during that time.  All of the off the shelf orthotics and about half the custom orthotics ended up in a bin which I labeled the orthotics graveyard.  None of the off the shelf orthotics worked well for my plantar fasciitis and damaged knee.  The custom orthotics that didn't end up in the graveyard worked ok but were never very comfortable.  Usually too hard with high points that irritated my arch.  These Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic Inserts are amazing.  They are exceptionally soft and comfortable while providing very good support for my arch.  They work very well for both plantar fasciitis as well as bad knees.  I absolutely love these things!  I'm so glad I found them.

As far as sizing, I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and find that the 10-10 1/2 orthotic positions the arch more effectively and fit the shoe better than the 9-9 1/2.

Bottom line - You'll love these things.  Very comfortable; Much less expensive than custom orthotics; The only pair of off the shelf orthotics that works so well.  These things are wonderful.  Try them.  You won't be disappointed."
5.0,This is the thing to have! It was great for me! It worked so well! NO more pain! Can't go wrong with this item! Perfect!
5.0,foot feels better buying another pair
5.0,I have ordered the Powerstep insoles for my family and friends for the last 3 years.  Amazon has delivered them very fast and the product is wonderful.  I recommend them highly.  They were prescribed to me by a foot Doctor.
5.0,My feet feels a lot better.
4.0,"Greatly helps discomfort for factory work. Bought as a gift for someones whose orthopedic doctor recommended them and now they won't wear shoes without a set of these in them. They are hard molded plastic meant for support, not cushion so you may want to keep that in mind when ordering. Marked down one star for highly damaged package but the price was good and the product wasn't damaged. Will re-order but likely from a different seller."
5.0,"work well, but get old pretty quick and expensive. These were the best for awhile."
5.0,"My son, daughter, and I all wear these in our work shoes - I swear by them!  Feet still hurt by the end of an 8 hour shift - but that is to be expected - I think....  They wear VERY WELL - actually - 2 of our 3 pair have been work for about 15 months and show no signs of wear... that is a quality product these days....  Obviously - we are repeat users and would highly recommend these."
5.0,Very comfortable and seem to be holding up well.
5.0,They work great
2.0,"The last pair I bought were great, This pair is breaking down after 2 weeks. Maybe I got a lemon"
5.0,I have plantar fasciitis and these work better than super feet or NB
5.0,THANKS CAME IN GOOD TIME AND ARE FINE
5.0,I have bought these about 6 month or more now. i love these insoles. I work on my feet all the time and i will not wear shoes without them. I had foot surgery and these have helped me in my heeling process.
5.0,cannot go without these in my shoes. makes walking distance easy....
5.0,I have been ordering for several years. These really make a difference.  Rarely have pain.
5.0,I love these inserts. Have been wearing them for years.
5.0,Works very well.. Great price.
3.0,"Sometimes my shoe feels too tight with these in and I have to remove to reduce the pressure on my feet. The support is nice, but I can't wear for prolonged periods. Perhaps its the shoe they're in."
5.0,The Mrs. love these and you know you have to keep the Mrs. happy.
5.0,These were recommended by my podiatrist. I have been wearing them ever since and they are wonderful!
5.0,These insoles are all we use for our kids since recommended by our foot doctor.
5.0,My wife loves them.
2.0,"Bought these in March 2014. My arches have never hurt, just the balls and heels. I read the reviews (tons of good ones) and was excited to plunk down the investment and try them out.

Initially, I thought, Hmm... maybe I need to break them in. They didn't feel much different than the original soles of my shoes. After wearing them all day, my feet seemed to hurt a little less. Within a month or two the top blue liner started separating from the second layer (as seen in some of the photos shared). I didn't really care as long as my feet felt better. But now (October 2014) after standing around in them for just 2 hours, the balls and heels of my feet feel bruised and achy. Disappointing."
5.0,Works great. Seems to fit shoes well. Durable
4.0,These insoles have helped my Plantar Faciitis tremendously.
4.0,Works great. Got them because of pain in my knees and shins while running. Payne is reduced now. this things work.
5.0,Recommended to me by my doctor.
5.0,"I was prescribed orthodics a few years ago and hate them. My feet slide around on their slippery surface and they're HARD. A PT recommended these. I love their arch support, which has just enough support and give."
5.0,This is a must if you suffer from plantar fasciitis.  These worked better than the $150 pair of insoles my doctor recommended.  Slip these in your shoes and you'll notice a difference right away.
5.0,These insoles are the best for the money on the market IMO. I have tried them all in this price range.
5.0,"Love these insoles!  I wear them in shoes that do not have the best support or insoles and they transform the shoes to comfortable, wearable shoes!"
5.0,"Definitely works in adjusting for bad arches, feet issues or combinations with shoes.  I have bought several now as I personally am tired of taking them out of one shoe and putting them into another.  Basically, I now have one set per shoe."
5.0,As good as I hoped for..great quality.
5.0,"I wear a 12 wide shoe and a 12-13.5 size fits perfectly without having to trim. I have happy feet now. I bought several pairs to keep from having to switch them out all time. It takes a few days to get used to wearing them, but they sure worked wonders at relieving my heal pain."
5.0,I love these. Found out the hard way a few years ago I've got flat feet and developed heal spurs. These work great and keep my feet pain free.
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT
5.0,These orthotics really helped my foot and at this time do not need to have custom ones made or have surgery.
5.0,it works
5.0,"I bought these for my husband who uses them in all of his shoes. I personally think he should get orthotics but he's very happy with these, he's heard all the horror expensive stories about orthotics, they last a long time, and then he got me hooked on them as well.

He uses the Powerstep Maxx in his steel-toed work boots..."
5.0,Exactly as described.
5.0,Can't say enough about the powerstep inserts.  They are pricey but work.  I have been using them in all my shoes for over a year since I had a couple very painful bouts of planter fasciitis and have not had a reoccurrence.
4.0,Work well
5.0,Much better than Dr. Scholls
5.0,Excellent support. Helped with my son's heal pain.
5.0,helps my foot a lot. very comfortable.
5.0,"So much better than insoles that come with ""expensive"" running shoes."
5.0,"Great purchase, makes my feel so better."
5.0,"This is my 2nd pair, for a new pair of shoes. These are way better than the insoles that come in regular sneakers."
5.0,I have tried other insoles but this is the best to use in my athletic shoes for my plantar fasciitis.
5.0,Makes a world of difference on my knees when I run.
5.0,favorite insoles---great support ---fit good on my wide feet
1.0,"Defective product.  Falls apart quickly. I bought one and thought they were great, so I bought 3 or 4 more.  The second pair fell apart (unfortunately I can't attach a photo that shows how badly they de-laminate and wear through).  Moreover, the company does not stand behind its product and becomes hyper suspicious when you file more than one complaint with them and brush you off.  This is not a company that one wants to do business with. COMPANY RATING - MINUS 3 STARS IF IT WERE POSSIBLE"
4.0,"I would highly recommend this product.  I am a nurse and am on my feet all day long, on hard concrete hospital floors.  I have suffered from plantar fasciitis for a couple of years now, due to this.  I have tried many shoe inserts from places like Wal-Mart and Walgreens, etc. but my feet continue to hurt.  I used these inserts with a new pair of Brooks Running shoes (I'm not a runner) and am absolutely amazed by the huge difference now!  I just worked three 12-hour shifts in a row and my legs and feet DO NOT HURT!  I am completely shocked.  Had I done this before I used this product, I would have not been able to get out of bed without extreme pain in my heels/foot arch's/legs.  I would have given this product 5 stars, but I felt that this product could have had a little bit higher arch and softer, more padded heel cushion.  Other than that, it's a great product and well worth the few extra dollars!  I highly recommend you try it!  I will be buying another set so I don't have to change out my inserts to another pair of shoes."
4.0,Very good product and a good price
5.0,"I have planetar fascitis.  Within two hours of wearing this orthotic, the pain was gone.  Over the course of days, a numbing of my leg that I was dealing with has all but disappeared."
5.0,Happy feet.
4.0,Good product
5.0,Great product.  Delivered in a timely manner.
3.0,"Power step has great products, products but these are too thick for almost all of my shoes"
4.0,"I bought these for a pair of dress shoes, but the insoles took up too much inner space even though the shoes are EE.  I was going to return the insoles, but I tried them in my Sketchers, which are a little big, and these isoles fit just fine.  I've only worn them  to a place where I always stand the entire time, over an hour.  These insoles worked quite well.  I have plantar faciitus and have to wear custom made orthotics which are not the most comfortable and quite expensive.  Powersteps are very reasonably priced.  If they work for you, you can save some money.  The appear to be good quality, too.  I have ordered another pair that 's  a D width and 1/2 size smaller.  Those were not Prime though.  I'll write another review on those when they get here some day."
5.0,I bought these to replace a pair I wore out (after 8 years). They are exactly what it bought in a local New Balance store but at HALF the price!
5.0,"I put these in my new cross trainers for every day use. Nice support.  I couldn't get the original soles out of the new shoes and these powersteps still fit inside.  It's a little snug, but still quite comfy."
5.0,outstanding
5.0,I've been wearing the original Powersteps for 7 years ever since they were recommended by my orthopedic knee surgeon. The Pinnacle Powersteps are even better with the addition of a little extra cushion.
5.0,"I've had them for about 1 month now, I'm pleased that my body, esp feet, aren't as sore as they were."
5.0,Very good product and they figured it out and raised the price to where it is now.  The fit my feet better than any other off the shelf products.  They are also very rugged and last a long time.  After a years use of day in and day out you can still read the company name on them.  The cushioning is soft and supportive all day.  The arch goes out to a natural slope to the center of your foot.  The arch is longer than expensive custom fit orthotics.  Try them and if you don't like them they will pick them up and give you your money back.  I have 5 years of wearing them and buy a pair every year.  I put the old ones in my beater hiking shoes and they still feel the same as the new ones.
5.0,These are my go to inserts for all of my shoes. I am a work who works 12 hour shifts. These inserts help me make it through my day without serious foot pain. My only complaint is that they only last around 3 months for me before I need a new pair.
5.0,are these good for running?
4.0,Good support  last a few months
5.0,Great product and good delivery! Just what my podiatrist ordered for me to wear!  Greatest price around!
4.0,"Provide best arch support out of several brands we tried, but find that fabric under big toe wears out prematurely."
5.0,"This is the best store bought orthotic insole I have ever bought. It is almost as good as the one that was hand made for me by my foot doctor. In fact, it isn't worth it to me to buy the one from the doctor because the insurance company will only pay for one per year and it wore out before that. By contrast, Powerstep Pinnacle will last for years even if used in hiking boots or other heavy use, it is way cheaper than the one from the doctor, and it is almost a good."
4.0,wear these in my shoes always!!! A doctor recommended them to me
5.0,Saved my life.
5.0,"Excellent arch support (I have high arches), relieved the pain immediately on the ball of my foot which was due to working on concrete. I was so impressed, I bought a couple more pairs for other shoes and wear them all the time. This is a wonderful product!"
5.0,Works well.
2.0,"I was hoping this would help with my plantar faciitis , but nope still in pain and can't walk. I stand all day as a nurse and this is where the problem starts.  I wear air max nike sneakers or dansko  clogs and can't find anything to help!!
It started nice and cushiony but then nothing"
5.0,"I purchased these to help with my back and knee pain, and they did."
5.0,"Love these and wear them in most of my shoes.  Podiatrist suggested that I get these about 10 years ago, Love them."
5.0,"The Powerstep Pinnacle insoles are WONDERFUL! They are the best over-the-counter insoles I have found, soothingly cushioning your soles and can put a spring in your step."
3.0,"On the plus side, these inserts are fantastic. I have had Plantar Fasciitis for two years now and these inserts do a great job maintaining support to aid healing. It's when I don't use them that I aggravate the injury, hindering healing!
On the negative side, they peel very quickly. Once the top layer peels back, the rubber layer erodes rapidly. They could improve on this product by doing a better job sealing the edge.
That said, I buy 2 pairs every 2-3 months and have yet to find a suitable replacement. Happy Feet. Dr Scholl's. etc. These seem to be the best. Recommended by my podiatrist and running store alike."
5.0,Just like orthotics
5.0,"So much better support than Superfeet. The key is the full length, rigid plastic design.  Most insoles don't sufficient rigid support. For Plantar Faciitis, it's counter-intuitive to want something more rigid under your arch to relieve your heel pain, but that's EXACTLY what you need to support the Plantar Fascia.  I now have a half-dozen Powerstep Insoles I've been wearing for years in my athletic shoes, and my Plantar Faciitis is completely gone."
5.0,Awesome.
5.0,ok
5.0,Awesome product the only orthotics I can use that last a reasonable period of time.
5.0,Very good arch support.
5.0,Wonderful to have such a good selection of sizes ... so you can get one that actually fits you.
4.0,Great all day support
5.0,These insoles are fantastic! This is my second pair and my feet do not hurt with these insoles. I would recommend them to everybody if you are on your feet for long periods of time!! I will buy again.
5.0,"By far this is the best Orthotic I've used.
I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and had to deal with the fact that i need to use Steel Toe Safety Shoes at work and work standing and walking a lot.  This was making my PF a nightmare.  This is the only Orthotic that worked with my Steel Toe shoes, they feel great and no longer feels like I'm re-injurying myself when working (with Safety Shoes).
Before this I tried almost everything from Dr. Scholls to DeFeet and OrthaHeel.  They all worked only on comfortable shoes but not on steel-toe working ones.

There is no ""break in"" time with this, you feel the aleve from the first instant you step on them.  So glad I found these."
5.0,Really comfortable.
5.0,Greatly helped my sore feet.
5.0,Love these! They fit perfectly inside my shoes and make my feet feel much better. These were recommended by a guy at a walking shoe store for me because I have really flat arches and my feet need support. Give them a try!
5.0,GREAT INSERT Releaves heel pain very well.
5.0,"Excelent product! They has helped my heels so much, I have no pain any more when walking. Will buy again."
5.0,"These arch supports are my favorite so far. I'm still on a mission to find the perfect insole, but so far, these are the best I've found. They are very comfortable, not overly thick, and help relieve my foot pain."
4.0,"These are great insoles that fit into all of my shoes. They really help with my high arches and making walking around more comfortable. My biggest issue is that the blue lining on top starts to come up, and I had to glue it back down a few times."
5.0,I have used these orthotics for many years. They provide the proper height of arch support with a touch of cushioning. Hope they continue to make them for a long time.
5.0,These were recommended by a podiatrist and saved my husband a lot of money.  They really worked for him.  Alternative was to have molded inserts made that would have cost $100's of dollars.
3.0,"It bums me out that some of us need to buy extra insoles for good shoes that don't have proper arch support (most of them), but if you gotta, then these insoles really work. My foot doc strongly suggested them for me and he was right. Feet feel much better. Quality of these things seems good, too. If my feet are happy, I'm happy.  Oh, don't forget to remove the existing insole! Yes, I know, basic info but some of us, ahem, had to learn the hard way. Sheesh."
5.0,The best!!!  You don't want to walk one step without these.
5.0,Still as good as ever.
5.0,This was our second pair.  It works!  My husband tried other gel inserts but they either wore out too soon for the price or didn't help his plantar fasciitis.  This gel insert REALLY works!
4.0,I have tried many products over the years to provide relief of my plantar fasciitis and most came in the form of shoe orthotics. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find relief ; you will almost do anything when you're in pain (Funny thing - when the Podiatrist recommended $400 inserts - I laughed at him and I have probably doubled that figure with many inserts in the ~ $50 range.) There are many products out there - some have helped slightly and others I think made it worse. To date - this is the best insert that I have tried. If I could give a rating of 4.5 - I would do so. A perfect rating of 5 would entail - I wouldn't know that I still had the condition. All in all - I would highly recommend this insert.
5.0,The best insoles for your feet.
1.0,"Hurt my feet,terrible."
5.0,an excellent product
5.0,Has helped my heel pain!  Actually contacts my arch.
5.0,Bought insoles while waiting for a podiatrist appointment as left heel was killing me.  I still needed to receive a steroid injection for diagnosis of plantar fasciitis/heel spur syndrome with bursitis when I finally got to see the podiatrist.  He approved my choice of this orthotic device/insole and I'll continue to wear Powerstep.
5.0,Happy feet!
3.0,"It's ok as an orthotic. I bought it for plantar fasciitis, and my plantar fasciitis is still the same."
5.0,"GREAT, FAST"
4.0,I have plantar fasciitis and this has worked well for me.  Not a huge amount of padding but fit my shoes well after I trimmed the toe area slightly.
4.0,good support
5.0,I suffer from plantar fasciitis. These are excellent in shoe cushions. They provide the support I need to keep the pain away.
5.0,So happy need to order more
5.0,"They provide comfortable support I appreciate, for gym and just general walking. Since trying my first pair, I've reordered several more pairs to place in other shoes, so always ready to go."
4.0,"They are great! This is my second pair. I run about 10 miles a week and after a year I felt like it was time to replace my original pair. I purchased my first pair from a shoe store that specializes in shoes for runners. I knew I was getting the best product and the right fit. After my original purchase, my legs felt better. Now looking back, I'm not sure I'd still be running had I not found this product. They are pricey but less expensive here."
5.0,"These worked well for my posture but only in shoes I could remove the insole from. If you need a quality product, check these out."
5.0,"This is my third pair of inserts and they are better than most of the over-the-counter-inserts out there right now.  My podiatrist recommended them due to my arches.  He indicated that my arches are starting to fall and I should use these inserts to prevent issues when I get older.  They are a cheaper alternative to custom orthotics.

The inserts are very sturdy.  There's a polymer insert between the cushions to make it stiff and after using them for a few days, your feet will conform to it and the inserts gets a little softer (my opinion).  It takes a few days to get used to them depending on how bad your arches are.  I would recommended them, however, make sure you consult with your doctor first.  Please make sure that you take out the orignal shoe liner and replaced with these.  If you have dress or casual shoes, there is an appropriate insert from Powerstep as well."
3.0,"fit in my shoes nice, but actually not giving me relief or helping pain in my heel go away, got these for my heel spur and end up taking out and putting in cushion insert. Instructions say to put regular shoe insert over this but good luck trying to fit both in your shoe, not sure they. We're were the money"
5.0,I have to have these insoles (inserts) in my Brooks Addiction Walker shoes - then I can do normal activities.  Wouldn't be able to without both!  Thanks Brooks and thanks Pinnacle!!
5.0,"These are incredibly comfortable!  They make a real difference in the comfort of everything -- shoes, slippers, boots.  I have plantar fasciitis, and with these insoles, my heels don't hurt!

The only tiny problem is that some of my shoes don't have removable insoles, and so adding the Powerstep Insole makes my shoes too tight.  I recommend taking the insole with you when you buy shoes.  You may need a bigger sized shoe."
5.0,Great product especially if you have high arches like me. I've been using them for years.
5.0,Couldn't walk without them.  The very best insoles on the market.
4.0,Good and solid. Would buy again when needed.
5.0,Awesome.  Foot issues went away.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sore feet.  Relief was almost immediate.
5.0,Excellent arch support.
5.0,I wear these in all my work shoes (usually Dockers Oxfords).  I work four 10-hour days and they really hold up well.
5.0,"I used to be in custom insoles, and I wore metal corrective shoes as a kid. These support my feet really well. I run daily in them and change them about every 4-6 months."
5.0,"This insert made my feet feel so much better!  Been battling (or really just suffering) plantar fasciitis in one foot only for a while.  I have high arches so my doc said I needed cushioning shoes to help.  Got squishy shoes (Skechers) and gel heel cups and some relief but these inserts (recommended by my dad!) probably helped the most.  My arches feel supported, my heels feel well-placed, and my whole foot is much happier.  Highly recommend.  I got these and also the 3/4 ones by same company that are a bit thinner and am wearing one or the other in every pair of shoes, depending on how much room they have."
5.0,"These are among the best orthotics. They have to be replaced more often the some other brands, but are significantly cheaper. These provide excellent arch support and needed relief to aching feet."
5.0,"These insoles are such a relief, really make a difference in my foot pain.  I wish I had found these sooner, but am so glad I have them now.  Shipping was fast and easy."
4.0,Second pair for my running shoes. They last two years for me as I run about 13 miles per week.
4.0,Great feeling insoles. I was dealing with plantar fasciitis and these have nullified the pain. I ordered a second set already. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the sizing doesn't match up very well. I ordered insoles for size 12/13 and the fit in an 11.5 shoe
5.0,My wife and I have been using the Pinnacle for years. We are both very active and yet they withstand the punishment and provide needed support.
5.0,My podiatrist actually recommended these and I'm very happy he did. I have severe problems with my feet and these really help and I am on my feet 12 hours a day. Again love these!
5.0,Purchased some for my wife and I and we both use them in all shoes as per the Orthopedic doctor advised for our activity level.  Have many sets and they are comfortable and hold up well. Price is par being PRIME and don't have to go to a doctors office to get them.
5.0,This was the only insert that I ever found that cured my plantar fasciitis problem.  Now I've worn them in every pair of shoes that I've bought in the past ten years.
5.0,I got some dress orthotix from a podiatrist years ago (not custom ones- office variety) and these rival those for alot less money
5.0,Both my husband and I wear these arch supports.  They are the best ones I've found.  They don't slip around in your shoe.  they provide great arch support for tired feet.
5.0,"I have pes calcium and perineal tendon issues.  I have used this product for over 2 years and have bought four pairs.  Good support, but not too severe. Prevents pronation."
